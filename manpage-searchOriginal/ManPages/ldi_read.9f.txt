ldi_read, ldi_write <-> Read and write from a device
#include <sys/sunldi.h>
int ldi_read(ldi_handle_t lh, struct uio *uiop, cred_t *cr);
int ldi_write(ldi_handle_t lh, struct uio *uiop, cred_t *cr);
lh Layered handle.
cr Pointer to a credential structure used to open a device.
uiop Pointer to the uio(9S) structure. uio(9S) specifies the location of the read or write data. (Either userland or
kernel.)
The ldi_read() function passes a read request to the device entry point for the device specified by the layered handle.
This operation is supported for block, character, and streams devices.
The ldi_write() function passes a write request to the device entry point for a device specified by the layered han<hy>
dle. This operation is supported for block, character, and streams devices.
The ldi_read() and ldi_write() functions return 0 upon success. If a failure occurs before the request is passed to
the device, the possible return values are shown below. Otherwise any other error number may be returned by the de<hy>
vice.
EINVAL Invalid input parameters.
ENOTSUP Operation is not supported for this device.
These functions may be called from user or kernel context.
