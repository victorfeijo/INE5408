mcopyout <-> Convert an M_IOCTL or M_IOCDATA message to an M_COPYOUT

void mcopyout(mblk_t *mp, void *private, size_t size, void *useraddr,
 mblk_t *dp);
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
mp M_IOCTL or M_IOCDATA message.
private Value to set the cq_private field of the copyreq(9S) to.
size Value to set the cq_size field of the copyreq(9S) to.
useraddr Optionally, the value to set the cq_addr field of the copyreq(9S) to.
dp Optionally, the payload to copy out.
The mcopyout() function converts an M_IOCTL or M_IOCDATA message into an M_COPYOUT message using
the supplied arguments.
To convert the message, mcopyout() changes the message type to M_COPYOUT, and its payload from a iocblk(9S)
to a copyreq(9S). Since the iocblk(9S) and copyreq(9S) are designed to overlay one another, the only fields which
must be updated are cq_private, cq_size, and cq_addr, which are set to the supplied values. If useraddr is passed as
NULL, the M_IOCTL must be transparent and cq_addr is assigned the pointer-sized quantity found at
mp->b_cont->b_rptr.
If dp is not NULL, any trailing message blocks associated with mp are freed, mp->b_cont is reset to dp and
dp->b_wptr is set to dp->b_rptr + size. Otherwise, any trailing message blocks are unaffected.
None.
This function can be called from user, kernel or interrupt context.
