ungetwc <-> push wide-character code back into input stream
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>
wint_t ungetwc(wint_t wc, FILE *stream);
The ungetwc() function pushes the character corresponding to the wide character code specified by wc back onto the
input stream pointed to by stream. The pushed-back characters will be returned by subsequent reads on that stream
in the reverse order of their pushing. A successful intervening call (with the stream pointed to by stream) to a file-
positioning function ( fseek(3C), fsetpos(3C) or rewind(3C)) discards any pushed-back characters for the stream.
The external storage corresponding to the stream is unchanged.
One character of push-back is guaranteed. If ungetwc() is called too many times on the same stream without an in<hy>
tervening read or file-positioning operation on that stream, the operation may fail.
If the value of wc equals that of the macro WEOF, the operation fails and the input stream is unchanged.
A successful call to ungetwc() clears the end-of-file indicator for the stream. The value of the file-position indicator
for the stream after reading or discarding all pushed-back characters will be the same as it was before the characters
were pushed back. The file-position indicator is decremented (by one or more) by each successful call to ungetwc();
if its value was 0 before a call, its value is indeterminate after the call.
Upon successful completion, ungetwc() returns the wide-character code corresponding to the pushed-back character.
Otherwise it returns WEOF.
The ungetwc() function may fail if:
EILSEQ An invalid character sequence is detected, or a wide-character code does not correspond to a valid charac<hy>
ter.
