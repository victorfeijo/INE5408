Use the sasl_client_step() interface performs a step in the authentication negotiation. sasl_client_step() returns
SASL_OK if the complete negotiation is successful. If the negotiation on step is completed successfuly, but at least
one more step is required, sasl_client_step() returns SASL_CONTINUE. A client should not assume an authentica<hy>
tion negotiaion is successful because the server signaled success through the protocol. For example, if the server sig<hy>
naled OK Authentication succeeded in IMAP, sasl_client_step() should be called one more time with a serverinlen
of zero.
If a call to sasl_client_step() returns SASL_INTERACT, the library requires some values before sasl_client_step()
can proceed. The prompt_need structure will be filled with the requests. The application should fulfull these requests
and call sasl_client_step() again with identical parameters. The prompt_need parameter will be the same pointer as
before, but it will have been filled in by the application.
conn The SASL connection context.
serverin The data given by the server. The data is decoded if the protocol encodes requests sent over the wire.
serverinlen The length of the serverin.
clientout
clientoutlen clientout and clientoutlen are created. They contain the initial client response to send to the server. It is
the job of the client to send them over the network to the server. Any protocol specific encodingthat is necessary, for
example base64 encoding, must be done by the client.
prompt_need A list of prompts that are needed to continue, if necessary.
sasl_client_step() returns an integer that corresponds to a SASL error code.
SASL_OK The call to sasl_client_start() was successful. Authentication is complete.
SASL_CONTINUE The call to sasl_client_start() was successful, but at least one more step is required for authen<hy>
tication.
SASL_INTERACT The library requires some values before sasl_client_step() can proceed.
All other error codes indicate an error situation that must be handled, or the authentication session should be quit.
See sasl_errors(3SASL) for information on SASL error codes.
