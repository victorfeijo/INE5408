securenets <-> configuration file for NIS security
/var/yp/securenets
The /var/yp/securenets file defines the networks or hosts which are allowed access to information by the Network
Information Service ("NIS").
The format of the file is as follows: <bu> Lines beginning with the ``#'' character are treated as comments. <bu> Otherwise,
each line contains two fields separated by white space. The first field is a netmask, the second a network. <bu> The net<hy>
mask field may be either 255.255.255.255 (IPv4), ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff (IPv6) , or the string ``host'' indi<hy>
cating that the second field is a specific host to be allowed access.
Both ypserv(1M) and ypxfrd(1M) use the /var/yp/securenets file. The file is read when the ypserv(1M) and
ypxfrd(1M) daemons begin. If /var/yp/securenets is present, ypserv(1M) and ypxfrd(1M) respond only to IP ad<hy>
dresses in the range given. In order for a change in the /var/yp/securenets file to take effect, you must kill and
restart any active daemons using ypstop(1M) and ypstart(1M).
An important thing to note for all the examples below is that the server must be allowed to access itself. You accom<hy>
plish this either by the server being part of a subnet that is allowed to access the server, or by adding an individual
entry, as the following:
 hosts 127.0.0.1
Example 1 Access for Individual Entries
If individual machines are to be give access, the entry could be:
 255.255.255.255 192.9.1.20
or
 host 192.0.1.20
Example 2 Access for a Class C Network
If access is to be given to an entire class C network, the entry could be:
 255.255.255.0 192.9.1.0
Example 3 Access for a Class B Network
The entry for access to a class B network could be:
 255.255.0.0 9.9.0.0
Example 4 Access for an Invidual IPv6 Address
Similarly, to allow access for an individual IPv6 address:
 ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff fec0::111:abba:ace0:fba5e:1
or
<beginning of page>
 host fec0::111:abba:ace0:fba5e:1
Example 5 Access for all IPv6 Addresses Starting with fe80
To allow access for all IPv6 addresses starting with fe80:
 ffff:: fe80::

The Network Information Service (NIS) was formerly known as Sun Yellow Pages (YP). The functionality of the
two remains the same; only the name has changed. The name Yellow Pages is a registered trademark in the United
