int kvm_nlist(kvm_t *kd, struct nlist *nl);
The kvm_nlist() function examines the symbol table from the kernel image identified by kd (see
kvm_open(3KVM)) and selectively extracts a list of values and puts them in the array of nlist structures pointed to
by nl. The name list pointed to by nl consists of an array of structures containing names, types and values. The
n_name field of each such structure is taken to be a pointer to a character string representing a symbol name. The
list is terminated by an entry with a null pointer (or a pointer to a null string) in the n_name field. For each entry in
nl, if the named symbol is present in the kernel symbol table, its value and type are placed in the n_value and
n_type fields. If a symbol cannot be located, the corresponding n_type field of nl is set to 0.
The kvm_nlist() functions returns the value of nlist(3UCB) or nlist(3ELF), depending on the library used.
