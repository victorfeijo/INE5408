poll.h, poll <-> definitions for the poll() function
#include <poll.h>
The <poll.h> header defines the pollfd structure, which includes the following members:
int fd the following descriptor being polled
short events the input event flags (see below)
short revents the output event flags (see below)
The <poll.h> header defines the following type through typedef:
nfds_t an unsigned integer type used for the number of file descriptors
The implementation supports one or more programming environments in which the width of nfds_t is no greater
than the width of type long. The names of these programming environments can be obtained using the confstr()
function or the getconf utility. See confstr(3C) and getconf(1).
The following symbolic constants are defined, zero or more of which can be OR'ed together to form the events or
revents members in the pollfd structure:
POLLIN Data other than high-priority data can be read without blocking.
POLLRDNORM Normal data can be read without blocking.
POLLRDBAND Priority data can be read without blocking.
POLLPRI High priority data can be read without blocking.
POLLOUT Normal data can be written without blocking.
POLLWRNORM Equivalent to POLLOUT.
POLLWRBAND Priority data can be written.
POLLERR An error has occurred (revents only).
POLLHUP Device has been disconnected (revents only).
POLLNVAL Invalid fd member (revents only).
The significance and semantics of normal, priority, and high-priority data are file and device-specific.
