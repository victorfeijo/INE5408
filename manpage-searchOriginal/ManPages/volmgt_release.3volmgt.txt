volmgt_release <-> release removable media device reservation
cc [ flag ... ] file ... -lvolmgt [ library ... ]
#include <volmgt.h>
int volmgt_release(char *dev);
This function is obsolete. The management of removable media by the Volume Management feature, including vold,
has been replaced by software that supports the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). Programmatic support for HAL
is through the HAL APIs, which are documented on the HAL web site. See hal(5). The return value of this function
is undefined.
The volmgt_release() routine releases the removable media device reservation specified as dev. See volmgt_ac<hy>
quire(3VOLMGT) for a description of dev.
If dev is reserved by the caller, volmgt_release() updates the internal device reservation database to indicate that
the device is no longer reserved. If the requested device is reserved by another process, the release attempt fails and
errno is set to 0.
The return from this function is undefined.
On failure, volmgt_release() returns 0, and sets errno for one of the following conditions:
EINVAL dev was invalid or missing.
EBUSY dev was not reserved by the caller.
Example 1 Using volmgt_release()
In the following example, volume management is running, and the first floppy drive is reserved, accessed and re<hy>
leased.
 #include <volmgt.h>
 char *errp;
 if (!volmgt_acquire("floppy0", "FileMgr", 0, &errp,
  NULL)) {
  /* handle error case */
  ...
 }
 /* floppy acquired - now access it */
 if (!volmgt_release("floppy0")) {
  /* handle error case */
  ...
 }
