mount attaches an MS-DOS file system (pcfs) to the file system hierarchy at the mount_point, which is the path<hy>
name of a directory. If mount_point has any contents prior to the mount operation, these are hidden until the file sys<hy>
tem is unmounted.
The pcfs file system supports direct mounting of files containing the file system as well as block devices. See
mount(1M) and lofiadm(1M).
If mount is invoked with special or mount_point as the only arguments, mount will search /etc/vfstab to fill in the
missing arguments, including the FSType-specific_options; see mount(1M) for more details.
The special argument can be one of two special device file types: <bu> A floppy disk, such as /dev/diskette0 or
/dev/diskette1. <bu> A DOS logical drive on a hard disk expressed as device-name:logical-drive , where device-name
specifies the special block device-file for the whole disk and logical-drive is either a drive letter (c through z) or a
drive number (1 through 24). Examples are /dev/dsk/c0t0d0p0:c and /dev/dsk/c0t0d0p0:1.
The special device file type must have a formatted MS-DOS file system with either a 12-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit File
Allocation Table.
generic_options
See mount(1M) for the list of supported options.
-o
Specify pcfs file system-specific options. The following options are supported:
clamptime | noclamptime
File timestamps in pcfs cover a range between January 1st 1980 and December 31st 2127. This is not equal to the
range of time_t on Unix for either 32-bit or 64-bit applications. In particular, 32-bit applications fail with EOVER<hy>
FLOW errors on the stat(2) system call when timestamps beyond the range of 32-bit time_t are encountered. In or<hy>
der to prevent such spurious failures, pcfs by default clamps timestamps to the common subset of possible pcfs time<hy>
stamps and the range available to 32-bit applications in Unix. The clamptime mount option therefore is active by
default. If you want access to the full range of possible timestamps on pcfs, mount the file system with the noclamp<hy>
time mount option. Note that if noclamptime is used, only 64-bit applications will have access to timestamps be<hy>
yond January 19th 2038, 03:14:06 UTC; 32-bit applications will encounter EOVERFLOW errors.
foldcase | nofoldcase
Force uppercase characters in filenames to lowercase when reading them from the filesystem. This is for compatibil<hy>
ity with the previous behavior of pcfs. The default is nofoldcase.
hidden | nohidden
Allow or disallow listing of files with hidden or system bits set. Option hidden is the default. When nohidden is ef<hy>
fect, hidden and system files are neither visible nor accessible. Note that PCFS in previous releases of the Solaris op<hy>
erating system used the nohidden option as the default.
atime | noatime
Enable or disable write access timestamps on DOS-formatted media. Default for fixed disks is atime, while for re<hy>
movable media noatime is used. The latter default is so that writes to flash-based media ("memory sticks") can be
minimized, to prolong lifetime.

timezone=timezone
Timestamps on DOS-formatted media are recorded in the local time of the recording system. This can cause confu<hy>
sion when accessing removable media in which the recording and receiving system use different time zones. Use this
option to force media timestamps to be interpreted for a specific time zone. The mount_pcfs command converts the
given time zone name into a numerical offset that is passed to the pcfs kernel module, using the same rules as de<hy>
scribed in environ(5) for the TZ environment variable. By default, the timezone value is taken from the TZ environ<hy>
ment variable.

If the directory on which a file system is to be mounted is a symbolic link, the file system is mounted on the directo<hy>
