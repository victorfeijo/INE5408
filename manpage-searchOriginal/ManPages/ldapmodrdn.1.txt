 [dn rdn]
ldapmodrdn opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and modifies the RDN of entries. The entry information
is read from standard input, from file through the use of the -f option, or from the command-line pair dn and rdn.
-c
Continuous operation mode. Errors are reported, but ldapmodify continues with modifications. The default is to exit
after reporting an error.
-D bindDN
Use the distinguished name binddn to bind to the directory.
-d debuglevel
Set the LDAP debugging level. Useful values of debuglevel for ldapmodrdn are:
1 Trace
2 Packets
4 Arguments
32 Filters
128 Access control
To request more than one category of debugging information, add the masks. For example, to request trace and filter
information, specify a debuglevel of 33.
-E
Ask server to expose (report) bind identity by means of authentication response control.
-f file
Read the entry modification information from file instead of from standard input or the command-line.
-?
Display the usage help text that briefly describes all options.
-H
Display the usage help text that briefly describes all options.
-h ldaphost
Specify an alternate host on which the LDAP server is running.
<beginning of page>
-i locale
Specify the character set to use for the -f LDIFfile or standard input. The default is the character set specified in the
LANG environment variable. You might choose to use this option to perform the conversion from the specified char<hy>
acter set to UTF8, thus overriding the LANG setting.
-J [:criticality[:value|::b64value|b64value|:fileurl]]
Criticality is a boolean value (default is false).
-j filename
Specify a file containing the password for the bind DN or the password for the SSL client's key database. To protect
the password, use this option in scripts and place the password in a secure file. This option is mutually exclusive of
the -w and -W options.
-k path
Specify the path to a directory containing conversion routines. These routines are used if you want to specify a lo<hy>
cale that is not supported by default by your directory server. This is for NLS support.
-M
Manage smart referrals. When they are the target of the operation, modify the entry containing the referral instead of
the entry obtained by following the referral.
-n
Previews modifications, but makes no changes to entries. Useful in conjunction with -v and -d for debugging.
-N certificate
Specify the certificate name to use for certificate-based client authentication. For example: -N "Directory-Cert".
-n
Show what would be done, but do not actually change entries. Useful in conjunction with -v for debugging.
-o attributename=value
For SASL mechanisms and other options such as security properties, mode of operation, authorization ID, authenti<hy>
cation ID, and so forth.
The different attribute names and their values are as follows:
secProp="number" For defining SASL security properties.
realm="value" Specifies SASL realm (default is realm=none).
authzid="value" Specify the authorization ID name for SASL bind.
authid="value" Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind.
mech="value" Specifies the various SASL mechanisms.

-O hopLimit
Specify the maximum number of referral hops to follow while finding an entry to modify. By default, there is no
limit.
-P path
Specify the path and filename of the client's certificate database. For example:
 -P /home/uid/.netscape/cert7.db
When using the command on the same host as the directory server, you can use the server's own certificate database.
For example:
 -P installDir/lapd-serverID/alias/cert7.db
Use the -P option alone to specify server authentication only.
-p ldapport
Specify an alternate TCP port where the secure LAPD server is listening.
-R
Do not automatically follow referrals returned while searching.
-r
Remove old RDN values from the entry. By default, old values are kept.
-V version
Specify the LDAP protocol version number to be used for the delete operation, either 2 or 3. LDAP v3 is the default.
Specify LDAP v2 when connecting to servers that do not support v3.
-v
Use verbose mode, with diagnostics written to standard output.
-W password
Specify the password for the client's key database given in the -P option. This option is required for certificate-based
client authentication. Specifying password on the command line has security issues because the password can be
seen by others on the system by means of the ps command. Use the -j instead to specify the password from the file.
This option is mutually exclusive of -j.
-w passwd
Use passwd as the password for authentication to the directory. When you use -w passwd to specify the password to
be used for authentication, the password is visible to other users of the system by means of the ps command, in
script files or in shell history. If you use the ldapmodrdn command without this option, the command will prompt
for the password and read it from standard in. When used without the -w option, the password will not be visible to
other users.
-Y proxyid
Specify the proxy DN (proxied authorization id) to use for the modify operation, usually in double quotes ("") for
the shell.
<beginning of page>
-Z
Specify that SSL be used to provide certificate-based client authentication. This option requires the -N and SSL
password and any other of the SSL options needed to identify the certificate and the key database.
If the command-line arguments dn and rdn are given, rdn replaces the RDN of the entry specified by the DN, dn.
Otherwise, the contents of file (or standard input if the - f option is not specified) must consist of one or more pair of
lines:
  Distinguished Name (DN)
  Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)
Use one or more blank lines to separate each DN/RDN pair.
The file /tmp/entrymods contains:
 cn=Modify Me, o=XYZ, c=US
 cn=The New Me
The command:
 example% ldapmodify -r -f /tmp/entrymods
changes the RDN of the "Modify Me" entry from "Modify Me" to "The New Me" and the old cn, "Modify Me" is
removed.

Exit status is 0 if no errors occur. Errors result in a non-zero exit status and a diagnostic message being written to
standard error.
