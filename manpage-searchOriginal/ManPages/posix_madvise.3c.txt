posix_madvise <-> memory advisory information
#include <sys/mman.h>
int posix_madvise(void *addr, size_t len, int advice);
The posix_madvise() function advises the system on the expected behavior of the application with respect to the da<hy>
ta in the memory starting at address addr, and continuing for len bytes. The system may use this information to opti<hy>
mize handling of the specified data. The posix_madvise() function has no effect on the semantics of access to mem<hy>
ory in the specified range, although it may affect the performance of access.
The advice to be applied to the memory range is specified by the advice parameter and may be one of the following
values:
POSIX_MADV_NORMAL Specifies that the application has no advice to give on its behavior with respect to the
specified range. It is the default characteristic if no advice is given for a range of memory.
POSIX_MADV_SEQUENTIAL Specifies that the application expects to access the specified range sequentially
from lower addresses to higher addresses.
POSIX_MADV_RANDOM Specifies that the application expects to access the specified range in a random order.
POSIX_MADV_WILLNEED Specifies that the application expects to access the specified range in the near future.
POSIX_MADV_DONTNEED Specifies that the application expects that it will not access the specified range in the
near future.
These values are defined in <sys/mman.h>
Upon successful completion, posix_madvise() returns zero. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the
error.
The posix_madvise() function will fail if:
EINVAL The value of advice is invalid.
ENOMEM Addresses in the range starting at addr and continuing for len bytes are partly or completely outside the
range allowed for the address space of the calling process.
The posix_madvise() function may fail if:
EINVAL The value of len is zero.
