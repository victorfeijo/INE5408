int stmfSetLuProp(luResource hdl, uint32_t prop, const char *propVal);
int stmfGetLuProp(luResource hdl, uint32_t prop, char *propVal,
 size_t *propLen);
hdl A logical unit resource previously allocated by stmfCreateLuResource(3STMF) or stmfGetLuRe<hy>
source(3STMF).
prop A property type value. See DESCRIPTION for valid values.
propVal A property value.
propLen The length of the specified property value. If propLen was of an insufficient size to hold the returned prop<hy>
erty value, propLen will contain the required size of the buffer and STMF_ERROR_INVALID_ARG will be re<hy>
turned.
These functions set or get property values. All property values are expressed in human-readable form. Boolean prop<hy>
erties are expressed in case insensitive form of "true" or "false". Properties that are represented by ASCII hexadeci<hy>
mal contain no leading characters to indicate a base hexadecimal representation (that is, no leading "0x"). The prop
argument can be one of the following values:
STMF_LU_PROP_ALIAS
Up to 255 characters representing a user defined name for the device.
Default: Set to file name of backing store.
STMF_LU_PROP_BLOCK_SIZE
Numeric value for block size in bytes in 2^n.
Default: 512
STMF_LU_PROP_COMPANY_ID
Organizational Unique Identifier. 6 hexadecimal ASCII characters representing the IEEE OUI company id assign<hy>
ment. This will be used to generate the device identifier (GUID).
Default: 00144F
STMF_LU_PROP_DATA_FILENAME
Character value representing the file name of the backing store device.
Default: None
STMF_LU_PROP_GUID
ASCII hexadecimal string of 32 characters representing the unique identifier for the device. This must be of valid 32
hexadecimal ASCII characters representing a valid NAA Registered Extended Identifier.
Default: Set by framework to a generated value.

STMF_LU_PROP_META_FILENAME
Metadata file name. When specified, will be used to hold the SCSI metadata for the logical unit.
Default: None. If this value is not specified, the value specified in STMF_LU_PROP_DATA_FILENAME will be
used.
STMF_LU_PROP_MGMT_URL
Up to 1024 characters representing Management Network Address URLs. More than one URL can be passed using
space delimited URLs.
STMF_LU_PROP_PID
Up to 16 characters of product identification that will be reflected in the Standard INQUIRY data returned for the de<hy>
vice.
Default: sSet to COMSTAR.
STMF_LU_PROP_PRODUCT_REV
Up to 4 characters of revision information that will be reflected in the Standard INQUIRY data returned for the de<hy>
vice.
Default: Set to 1.0.
STMF_LU_PROP_SERIAL_NUM
Serial Number. Specifies the SCSI Vital Product Data Serial Number (page 80h). It is a character value up to 252
bytes in length.
Default: None
STMF_LU_PROP_SIZE
Numeric value w/optional suffix, e.g. 100G, 1T, to specify unit of size.
Default: Size of the device specified in the STMF_LU_PROP_DATA_FILENAME property value.
STMF_LU_PROP_VID
8 characters of vendor identification per SCSI SPC-3 and will be reflected in the Standard INQUIRY data returned
for the device.
Default: Set to SUN.
STMF_LU_PROP_WRITE_CACHE_DISABLE
Write back cache disable. When specified as "true" or "false", specifies write back cache disable behavior.
Default: Writeback cache setting of the backing store device specified by STMF_LU_PROP_DATA_FILENAME.
STMF_LU_PROP_WRITE_PROTECT
Write protect bit. When specified as "true" or "false", specifies whether the device behaves as a write protected de<hy>
vice.
Default: "false"
The following values are returned:

STMF_ERROR_INVALID_ARG
Either prop or propVal is unrecognized.
STMF_ERROR_INVALID_PROPSIZE
The size of propVal is invalid.
