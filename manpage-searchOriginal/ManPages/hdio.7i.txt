hdio <-> SMD and IPI disk control operations
#include <sys/hdio.h>
Note -
The SMC and IPI drivers have been discontinued. dkio(7I) is now the preferred method for retrieving disk informa<hy>
tion.
The SMD and IPI disk drivers supplied with this release support a set of ioctl(2) requests for diagnostics and bad
sector information. Basic to these ioctl() requests are the definitions in <sys/hdio.h>.
HDKIOCGTYPE The argument is a pointer to a hdk_type structure (described below). This ioctl() gets specific
information from the hard disk.
HDKIOCSTYPE The argument is a pointer to a hdk_type structure (described below). This ioctl() sets specific in<hy>
formation about the hard disk.
 /*
  * Used for drive info
  */
 struct hdk_type {
  ushort_t hdkt_hsect; /* hard sector count (read only) */
  ushort_t hdkt_promrev; /* prom revision (read only) */
  uchar_t hdkt_drtype; /* drive type (ctlr specific) */
  uchar_t hdkt_drstat; /* drive status (ctlr specific, ro) */
 };
HDKIOCGBAD The argument is a pointer to a hdk_badmap structure (described below). This ioctl() is used to
get the bad sector map from the disk.
HDKIOCSBAD The argument is a pointer to a hdk_badmap structure (described below). This ioctl() is used to set
the bad sector map on the disk.
 /*
  * Used for bad sector map
  */
 struct hdk_badmap {
  caddr_t hdkb_bufaddr; /* address of user's map buffer */
 };
HDKIOCGDIAG The argument is a pointer to a hdk_diag structure (described below). This ioctl() gets the most
recent command that failed along with the sector and error number from the hard disk.
 /*
  * Used for disk diagnostics
  */
 struct hdk_diag {
  ushort_thdkd_errcmd; /* most recent command in error */
  daddr_t hdkd_errsect; /* most recent sector in error */
  uchar_t hdkd_errno; /* most recent error number */
  uchar_t hdkd_severe; /* severity of most recent error */
 };
ioctl(2), dkio(7I)
