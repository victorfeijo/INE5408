fiocompress <-> file compression utility
/sbin/fiocompress -c [-m] [-b block_size] input_file output_file
/sbin/fiocompress -d input_file output_file
The fiocompress utility is a file compression tool that works together with the dcfs(7FS) file system to perform per-
file compression. You can use fiocompress to decompress a compressed file or mark a compressed file as com<hy>
pressed, causing automatic decompression on read. The primary use of fiocompress is to compress files in the boot
archive.
Note that this utility is not a Committed interface. See attributes(5).
The following options are supported:
-b block_size
Specify a block size for compression. The default block size is 8192.
-c
Compress the specified file.
-d
Decompress the specified file.
-m
Mark the compressed file for automatic decompression on read. Can be used only in conjunction with -c.

This compression/decompression utility works only with files stored in a UFS file system.
There is no obvious way to determine whether a given file is compressed, other than copying the file and comparing
the number of disk blocks of the copy against the original.
