The fmdump utility can be used to display the contents of any of the log files associated with the Solaris Fault Man<hy>
ager, fmd(1M). The Fault Manager runs in the background on each Solaris system. It receives telemetry information
relating to problems detected by the system software, diagnoses these problems, and initiates proactive self-healing
activities such as disabling faulty components.
The Fault Manager maintains two sets of log files for use by administrators and service personnel:
error log A log which records error telemetry, the symptoms of problems detected by the system.
fault log A log which records fault diagnosis information, the problems believed to explain these symptoms.
By default, fmdump displays the contents of the fault log, which records the result of each diagnosis made by the
fault manager or one of its component modules.
An example of a default fmdump display follows:
 # fmdump
 TIME UUID SUNW-MSG-ID

 Dec 28 13:01:49.3765 3a186292-3402-40ff-b5ae-810601be337d FMD-8000-11

 ...
Each problem recorded in the fault log is identified by: <bu> The time of its diagnosis <bu> A Universal Unique Identifier
(UUID) that can be used to uniquely identify this particular problem across any set of systems <bu> A message identifier
that can be used to access a corresponding knowledge article located at Sun's web site, http://www.sun.com/msg/
If a problem requires action by a human administrator or service technician or affects system behavior, the Fault
Manager also issues a human-readable message to syslogd(1M). This message provides a summary of the problem
and a reference to the knowledge article on the Sun web site, http://www.sun.com/msg/.
You can use the -v and -V options to expand the display from a single-line summary to increased levels of detail for
each event recorded in the log. The -c, -t, -T, and -u options can be used to filter the output by selecting only those
events that match the specified class, range of times, or uuid.
If more than one filter option is present on the command-line, the options combine to display only those events that
are selected by the logical AND of the options. If more than one instance of the same filter option is present on the
command-line, the like options combine to display any events selected by the logical OR of the options. For exam<hy>
ple, the command:
 # fmdump -u uuid1 -u uuid2 -t 02Dec03
selects events whose attributes are (uuid1 OR uuid2) AND (time on or after 02Dec03).
The following options are supported:
-c class
Select events that match the specified class. The class argument can use the glob pattern matching syntax described
in sh(1). The class represents a hierarchical classification string indicating the type of telemetry event. More infor<hy>
mation about Sun's telemetry protocol is available at Sun's web site, http://www.sun.com/msg/.
-e
Display events from the fault management error log instead of the fault log. This option is shorthand for specifying
<beginning of page>
the pathname of the error log file.
The error log file contains Private telemetry information used by Sun's automated diagnosis software. This informa<hy>
tion is recorded to facilitate post-mortem analysis of problems and event replay, and should not be parsed or relied
upon for the development of scripts and other tools. See attributes(5) for information about Sun's rules for Private
interfaces.
-f
Follow the growth of the log file by waiting for additional data. fmdump enters an infinite loop where it will sleep
for a second, attempt to read and format new data from the log file, and then go back to sleep. This loop can be ter<hy>
minated at any time by sending an interrupt (Control-C).
-m
Print the localized diagnosis message associated with each entry in the fault log.
-n name[.name]*[=value]
Select fault log or error log events, depending on the -e option, that have properties with a matching name (and op<hy>
tionally a matching value). For string properties the value can be a regular expression match. Regular expression
syntax is described in the EXTENDED REGULAR EXPRESSIONS section of the regex(5) manual page. Be care<hy>
ful when using the characters:
 $ * { ^ | ( ) \
...or a regular expression, because these are meaningful to the shell. It is safest to enclose any of these in single
quotes. For numeric properties, the value can be octal, hex, or decimal.
-R dir
Use the specified root directory for the log files accessed by fmdump, instead of the default root (/).
-t time
Select events that occurred at or after the specified time. The time can be specified using any of the following forms:
mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss
Month, day, year, hour in 24-hour format, minute, and second. Any amount of whitespace can separate the date and
time. The argument should be quoted so that the shell interprets the two strings as a single argument.
mm/dd/yy hh:mm
Month, day, year, hour in 24-hour format, and minute. Any amount of whitespace can separate the date and time.
The argument should be quoted so that the shell interprets the two strings as a single argument.
mm/dd/yy
12:00:00AM on the specified month, day, and year.
ddMonyy hh:mm:ss
Day, month name, year, hour in 24-hour format, minute, and second. Any amount of whitespace can separate the
date and time. The argument should be quoted so that the shell interprets the two strings as a single argument.
ddMonyy hh:mm
Day, month name, year, hour in 24-hour format, and minute. Any amount of whitespace can separate the date and
time. The argument should be quoted so that the shell interprets the two strings as a single argument.
<beginning of page>
Mon dd hh:mm:ss
Month, day, hour in 24-hour format, minute, and second of the current year.
yyyy-mm-dd [T hh:mm[:ss]]
Year, month, day, and optional hour in 24-hour format, minute, and second. The second, or hour, minute, and sec<hy>
ond, can be optionally omitted.
ddMonyy
12:00:00AM on the specified day, month name, and year.
hh:mm:ss
Hour in 24-hour format, minute, and second of the current day.
hh:mm
Hour in 24-hour format and minute of the current day.
Tns | Tnsec
T nanoseconds ago where T is an integer value specified in base 10.
Tus |Tusec
T microseconds ago where T is an integer value specified in base 10.
Tms | Tmsec
T milliseconds ago where T is an integer value specified in base 10.
Ts | Tsec
T seconds ago where T is an integer value specified in base 10.
Tm |Tmin
T minutes ago where T is an integer value specified in base 10.
Th |Thour
T hours ago where T is an integer value specified in base 10.
Td |Tday
T days ago where T is an integer value specified in base 10.
You can append a decimal fraction of the form .n to any -t option argument to indicate a fractional number of sec<hy>
onds beyond the specified time.
-T time
Select events that occurred at or before the specified time. time can be specified using any of the time formats de<hy>
scribed for the -t option.
<beginning of page>
-u uuid
Select fault diagnosis events that exactly match the specified uuid. Each diagnosis is associated with a Universal
Unique Identifier (UUID) for identification purposes. The -u option can be combined with other options such as -v
to show all of the details associated with a particular diagnosis.
If the -e option and -u option are both present, the error events that are cross-referenced by the specified diagnosis
are displayed.
-v
Display verbose event detail. The event display is enlarged to show additional common members of the selected
events.
-V
Display very verbose event detail. The event display is enlarged to show every member of the name-value pair list
associated with each event. In addition, for fault logs, the event display includes a list of cross-references to the cor<hy>
responding errors that were associated with the diagnosis.
The following operands are supported:
file Specifies an alternate log file to display instead of the system fault log. The fmdump utility determines the type
of the specified log automatically and produces appropriate output for the selected log.
Example 1 Retrieving Given Class from fmd Log
Use any of the following commands to retrieve information about a specified class from the fmd log. The complete
class name is ereport.io.ddi.context.
 # fmdump -Ve -c 'ereport.io.ddi.context'
 # fmdump -Ve -c 'ereport.*.context'
 # fmdump -Ve -n 'class=ereport.io.ddi.context'
 # fmdump -Ve -n 'class=ereport.*.context'
Any of the preceding commands produces the following output:
 Oct 06 2007 11:53:20.975021712 ereport.io.ddi.context
  nvlist version: 0
  class = ereport.io.ddi.context
  ena = 0x1b03a15ecf00001
  detector = (embedded nvlist)
  nvlist version: 0
  version = 0x0
  scheme = dev
  device-path = /
  (end detector)
  __ttl = 0x1
  __tod = 0x470706b0 0x3a1da690
Example 2 Retrieving Specific Detector Device Path from fmd Log
The following command retrieves a detector device path from the fmd log.
 # fmdump -Ve -n 'detector.device-path=.*/disk@1,0$'
 Oct 06 2007 12:04:28.065660760 ereport.io.scsi.disk.rqs
 nvlist version: 0
  class = ereport.io.scsi.disk.rqs
<beginning of page>
  ena = 0x453ff3732400401
  detector = (embedded nvlist)
  nvlist version: 0
  version = 0x0
  scheme = dev
  device-path = /pci@0,0/pci1000,3060@3/disk@1,0
  (end detector)
  __ttl = 0x1
  __tod = 0x4707094c 0x3e9e758
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion. All records in the log file were examined successfully.
1 A fatal error occurred. This prevented any log file data from being examined, such as failure to open the specified
file.
2 Invalid command-line options were specified.
3 The log file was opened successfully, but one or more log file records were not displayed, either due to an I/O error
or because the records themselves were malformed. fmdump issues a warning message for each record that could
not be displayed, and then continues on and attempts to display other records.

Fault logs contain references to records stored in error logs that can be displayed using fmdump -V to understand
the errors that were used in the diagnosis of a particular fault. These links are preserved if an error log is renamed as
part of log rotation. They can be broken by removing an error log file, or by moving it to another filesystem directo<hy>
ry. fmdump can not display error information for such broken links. It continues to display any and all information
present in the fault log.
