xenstored <-> xVM store daemon
/usr/lib/xenstored
The xenstored daemon provides control of the configuration of Solaris xVM domains.
The xenstored service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/system/xvm/store:default
The service's status can be queried using the svcs(1) command.
The service can be enabled successfully only when running under xVM.
At this time, attempts to restart the daemon can cause the failure of xVM management tools as well as running do<hy>
mains. If the daemon needs to be restarted, a reboot is necessary.
