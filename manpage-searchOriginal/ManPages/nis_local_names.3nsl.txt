These functions return several default NIS+ names associated with the current process.
nis_local_directory() returns the name of the NIS+ domain for this machine. This is currently the same as the Se<hy>
cure RPC domain returned by the sysinfo(2) system call.
nis_local_host() returns the NIS+ name of the current machine. This is the fully qualified name for the host and is
either the value returned by the gethostname(3C) function or, if the host name is only partially qualified, the con<hy>
catenation of that value and the name of the NIS+ directory. Note that if a machine's name and address cannot be
found in the local NIS+ directory, its hostname must be fully qualified.
nis_local_group() returns the name of the current NIS+ group name. This is currently set by setting the environment
variable NIS_GROUP to the groupname.
nis_local_principal() returns the NIS+ principal name for the user associated with the effective UID of the calling
process. This function maps the effective uid into a principal name by looking for a LOCAL type credential in the
table named cred.org_dir in the default domain. See nisaddcred(1M).
The result returned by these routines is a pointer to a data structure with the NIS+ library, and should be considered
a "read-only" result and should not be modified.
NIS_GROUP This variable contains the name of the local NIS+ group. If the name is not fully qualified, the value
returned by nis_local_directory() will be concatenated to it.

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
NIS+ to LDAP are available in the current Solaris release. For more information, visit http://www.sun.com/directo<hy>
