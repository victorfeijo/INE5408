syncstat <-> report driver statistics from a synchronous serial link
/usr/sbin/syncstat [-c] device [interval]
The syncstat command reports the event statistics maintained by a synchronous serial device driver. The report may
be a single snapshot of the accumulated totals, or a series of samples showing incremental changes. Prior to these it
prints the device name being used to query a particular device driver, along with a number indicating the channel
number (ppa) under control of that driver.
Event statistics are maintained by a driver for each physical channel that it supports. They are initialized to zero at
the time the driver module is loaded into the system, which may be either at boot time or when one of the driver's
entry points is first called.
The device argument is the name of the serial device as it appears in the /dev directory. For example, zsh0 specifies
the first on-board serial device.
The following is a breakdown of syncstat output:
tab(); lw(1.1i) lw(4.4i) lw(1.1i) lw(4.4i) speedT{ The line speed the device has been set to operate at. It is the user's
responsibility to make this value correspond to the modem clocking speed when clocking is provided by the modem.
T} ipktsThe total number of input packets. opktsThe total number of output packets. undrunT{ The number of
transmitter underrun errors. T} ovrrunThe number of receiver overrun errors. abortThe number of aborted re<hy>
ceived frames. crcT{ The number of received frames with CRC errors. T} isizeT{ The average size (in bytes) of in<hy>
put packets. T} osizeT{ The average size (in bytes) of output packets. T}
-c Clear the accumulated statistics for the device specified. This may be useful when it is not desirable to unload a
particular driver, or when the driver is not capable of being unloaded.
interval syncstat samples the statistics every interval seconds and reports incremental changes. The output reports
line utilization for input and output in place of average packet sizes. These are the relationships between bytes trans<hy>
ferred and the baud rate, expressed as percentages. The loop repeats indefinitely, with a column heading printed ev<hy>
ery twenty lines for convenience.
Example 1 Sample output from the syncstat command:
 example# syncstat zsh0
 speed ipkts opkts undrun ovrrun abort crc isize osize
 9600 15716 17121 0 0 1 3 98 89
 example# syncstat -c zsh0
 speed ipkts opkts undrun ovrrun abort crc isize osize
 9600 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In the following sample output a new line of output is generated every five seconds:
 example# syncstat zsh0 5
 ipkts opkts undrun ovrrun abort crc iutil outil
 12 10 0 0 0 0 5% 4%
 22 60 0 0 0 0 3% 90%

bad interval: arg
The argument arg is expected to be an interval and could not be understood.
device missing minor device number
The name device does not end in a decimal number that can be used as a minor device number.
baud rate not set
The interval option is being used and the baud rate on the device is zero. This would cause a divide-by-zero error
when computing the line utilization statistics.
Underrun, overrun, frame-abort, and CRC errors have a variety of causes. Communication protocols are typically
able to handle such errors and initiate recovery of the transmission in which the error occurred. Small numbers of
such errors are not a significant problem for most protocols. However, because the overhead involved in recovering
from a link error can be much greater than that of normal operation, high error rates can greatly degrade overall link
throughput. High error rates are often caused by problems in the link hardware, such as cables, connectors, interface
electronics or telephone lines. They may also be related to excessive load on the link or the supporting system.
The percentages for input and output line utilization reported when using the interval option may occasionally be
reported as slightly greater than 100% because of inexact sampling times and differences in the accuracy between
the system clock and the modem clock. If the percentage of use greatly exceeds 100%, or never exceeds 50%, then
the baud rate set for the device probably does not reflect the speed of the modem.
