If no user operand is provided, the id utility writes the user and group IDs and the corresponding user and group
names of the invoking process to standard output. If the effective and real IDs do not match, both are written. If mul<hy>
tiple groups are supported by the underlying system, /usr/xpg4/bin/id also writes the supplementary group affilia<hy>
tions of the invoking process.
If a user operand is provided and the process has the appropriate privileges, the user and group IDs of the selected
user are written. In this case, effective IDs are assumed to be identical to real IDs. If the selected user has more than
one allowable group membership listed in the group database, /usr/xpg4/bin/id writes them in the same manner as
the supplementary groups described in the preceding paragraph.
The following formats are used when the LC_MESSAGES locale category specifies the "C" locale. In other locales,
the strings uid, gid, euid, egid, and groups may be replaced with more appropriate strings corresponding to the lo<hy>
cale.
 "uid=%u(%s) gid=%u(%s)\n" <real user ID>, <user-name>,
  <real group ID>, <group-name>
If the effective and real user IDs do not match, the following are inserted immediately before the \n character in the
previous format:
 " euid=%u(%s)"
with the following arguments added at the end of the argument list:
 <effective user ID>, <effective user-name>
If the effective and real group IDs do not match, the following is inserted directly before the \n character in the for<hy>
mat string (and after any addition resulting from the effective and real user IDs not matching):
 " egid=%u(%s)"
with the following arguments added at the end of the argument list:
 <effectivegroup-ID>, <effectivegroupname>
<beginning of page>
If the process has supplementary group affiliations or the selected user is allowed to belong to multiple groups, the
first is added directly before the NEWLINE character in the format string:
 " groups=%u(%s)"
with the following arguments added at the end of the argument list:
 <supplementary group ID>, <supplementary group name>
and the necessary number of the following added after that for any remaining supplementary group IDs:
 ",%u(%s)"
and the necessary number of the following arguments added at the end of the argument list:
 <supplementary group ID>, <supplementary group name>
If any of the user ID, group ID, effective user ID, effective group ID or supplementary/multiple group IDs cannot be
mapped by the system into printable user or group names, the corresponding (%s) and name argument is omitted
from the corresponding format string.
When any of the options are specified, the output format is as described under OPTIONS.
The following options are supported by both /usr/bin/id and /usr/xpg4/bin/id. The -p and -a options are invalid if
specified with any of the -G, -g, or -u options.
-p Reports additionally the current project membership of the invoking process. The project is reported using the
format:
 "projid=%u(%s)"
which is inserted prior to the 0fR character of the default format described in the Formats section. The argu<hy>
ments
 <project ID>,<project name>
are appended to the end of the argument list. If the project ID cannot be mapped by the system into a printable
project name, the corresponding (%s) and name argument is omitted from the corresponding format string.
-a Reports user name, user ID and all the groups to which the user belongs.
-G Outputs all different group IDs (effective, real and supplementary) only, using the format "%u\n". If there is
more than one distinct group affiliation, output each such affiliation, using the format " %u", before the NEWLINE
character is output.
-g Outputs only the effective group ID, using the format "%u\n".
-n Outputs the name in the format "%s" instead of the numeric ID using the format "%u".
<beginning of page>
-r Outputs the real ID instead of the effective ID.
-u Outputs only the effective user ID, using the format "%u\n".
The following operand is supported:
user The user (login) name for which information is to be written.
See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of id: LANG,
LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred.

Output produced by the -G option and by the default case could potentially produce very long lines on systems that
support large numbers of supplementary groups.
