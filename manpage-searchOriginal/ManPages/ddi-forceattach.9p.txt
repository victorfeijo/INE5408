ddi-forceattach, ddi-no-autodetach <-> properties controlling driver attach/detach behavior
Solaris device drivers are attached by devfsadm(1M) and by the kernel in response to open(2) requests from appli<hy>
cations. Drivers not currently in use can be detached when the system experiences memory pressure. The ddi-
forceattach and ddi-no-autodetach properties can be used to customize driver attach/detach behavior.
The ddi-forceattach is an integer property, to be set globally by means of the driver.conf(4) file. Drivers with this
property set to 1 are loaded and attached to all possible instances during system startup. The driver will not be auto-
detached due to system memory pressure.
The ddi-no-autodetach is an integer property to be set globally by means of the driver.conf(4) file or created dy<hy>
namically by the driver on a per-instance basis with ddi_prop_update_int(9F). When this property is set to 1, the
kernel will not auto-detach driver due to system memory pressure.
Note that ddi-forceattach implies ddi-no-autodetach. Setting either property to a non-integer value or an integer
value not equal to 1 produces undefined results. These properties do not prevent driver detaching in response to re<hy>
configuration requests, such as executing commands cfgadm(1M), modunload(1M), rem_drv(1M), and up<hy>
date_drv(1M).
