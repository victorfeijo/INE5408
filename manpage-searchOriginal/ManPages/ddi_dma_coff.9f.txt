ddi_dma_coff <-> convert a DMA cookie to an offset within a DMA handle.

int ddi_dma_coff(ddi_dma_handle_t handle, ddi_dma_cookie_t *cookiep,
 off_t *offp);
Solaris SPARC DDI (Solaris SPARC DDI). This interface is obsolete.
handle The handle filled in by a call to ddi_dma_setup(9F).
cookiep A pointer to a DMA cookie (see ddi_dma_cookie(9S)) that contains the appropriate address, length and bus
type to be used in programming the DMA engine.
offp A pointer to an offset to be filled in.
The ddi_dma_coff() function converts the values in DMA cookie pointed to by cookiep to an offset (in bytes) from
the beginning of the object that the DMAhandle has mapped.
The ddi_dma_coff() function allows a driver to update a DMA cookie with values it reads from its device's DMA
engine after a transfer completes and convert that value into an offset into the object that is mapped for DMA.
The ddi_dma_coff() function returns:
DDI_SUCCESS Successfully filled in offp.
DDI_FAILURE Failed to successfully fill in offp.
The ddi_dma_coff() function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context.
