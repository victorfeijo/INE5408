setlabel <-> move files to zone with corresponding sensitivity label
/usr/bin/setlabel newlabel filename...
setlabel moves files into the zone whose label corresponds to newlabel. The old file pathname is adjusted so that it is
relative to the root pathname of the new zone. If the old pathname for a file's parent directory does not exist as a di<hy>
rectory in the new zone, the file is not moved. Once moved, the file might no longer be accessible in the current
zone.
Unless newlabel and filename have been specified, no labels are set.
Labels are defined by the security administrator at your site. The system always displays labels in uppercase. Users
can enter labels in any combination of uppercase and lowercase. Incremental changes to labels are supported.
Refer to setflabel(3TSOL) for a complete description of the conditions that are required to satisfy this command,
and the privileges that are needed to execute this command.
setlabel exits with one of the following values:
0 Successful completion.
1 Usage error.
2 Error in getting, setting or translating the label.
On the command line, enclose the label in double quotes unless the label is only one word. Without quotes, a second
word or letter separated by a space is interpreted as a second argument.
 % setlabel SECRET somefile
 % setlabel "TOP SECRET" somefile
Use any combination of upper and lowercase letters. You can separate items in a label with blanks, tabs, commas or
slashes (/). Do not use any other punctuation.
 % setlabel "ts a b" somefile
 % setlabel "ts,a,b" somefile
 % setlabel "ts/a b" somefile
 % setlabel " TOP SECRET A B " somefile
Example 1 Set a Label.
To set somefile's label to SECRET A:
 example% setlabel "Secret a" somefile
Example 2 Turn On a Compartment.
Plus and minus signs can be used to modify an existing label. A plus sign turns on the specified compartment for
somefile's label.
 example% setlabel +b somefile
Example 3 Turn Off a Compartment.
A minus sign turns off the compartments that are associated with a classification. To turn off compartment A in
somefile's label:
<beginning of page>
 example% setlabel -A somefile
If an incremental change is being made to an existing label and the first character of the label is a hyphen (<mi>), a pre<hy>
ceding double-hyphen (--) is required.
To turn off compartment -A in somefile's label:
 example% setlabel -- -A somefile
