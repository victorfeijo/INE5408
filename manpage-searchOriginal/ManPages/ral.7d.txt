ral <-> Ralink RT2500 802.11b/g Wireless driver
The ral 802.11b/g wireless NIC driver is a multi-threaded, loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based STREAMS driver
supporting Ralink RT2500 chipset-based NIC's.
The ral driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rate and mode. Supported 802.11b data rates are 1, 2,
5.5 and 11 Mbits/sec. Supported 802.11g data rates are 1, 2, 5.5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 54 Mbits/sec. The
ral driver supports only BSS networks (also known as "ap" or "infrastructure" networks) and "open"(or "open-sys<hy>
tem") or "shared system" authentication.
