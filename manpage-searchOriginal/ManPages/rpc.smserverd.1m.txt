rpc.smserverd <-> removable media device server
/usr/lib/smedia/rpc.smserverd
rpc.smserverd is a server that handles requests from client applications, such as volume management software, for
access to removable media devices. In addition to volume management software, rmformat(1) and the CDE Filem<hy>
anager (when performing removable media operations) are rpc.smserverd clients. The rpc.smserverd daemon is
started by inetd(1M) when a client makes a call to a Solaris-internal library to access a SCSI, IDE, or USB device.
The daemon is not started if a client attempts to access a floppy or PCMCIA device. Once started, the daemon re<hy>
mains active until such time as it is idle for three minutes or more.
The rpc.smserverd daemon is provided for the exclusive use of the client applications mentioned above. It has no
external, customer-accessible interfaces, including no configuration file.
