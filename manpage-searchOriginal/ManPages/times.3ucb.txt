int times(tmsp)
register struct tms *tmsp;
The times() function returns time-accounting information for the current process and for the terminated child pro<hy>
cesses of the current process. All times are reported in clock ticks. The number of clock ticks per second is defined
by the variable CLK_TCK, found in the header <limits.h>.
A structure with the following members is returned by times():
 time_t tms_utime; /* user time */
 time_t tms_stime; /* system time */  
 time_t tms_cutime; /* user time, children */
 time_t tms_cstime; /* system time, children */
The children's times are the sum of the children's process times and their children's times.
Upon successful completion, times() returns 0. Otherwise, it returns <mi>1.
time(1), time(2), getrusage(3C), wait(3C)
Use of these interfaces should be restricted to only applications written on BSD platforms. Use of these interfaces
with any of the system libraries or in multi-threaded applications is unsupported.
The times() function has been superseded by getrusage(3C).
