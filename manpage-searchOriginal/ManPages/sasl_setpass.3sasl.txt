int sasl_setpass(sasl_conn_t *conn, const char *user, const char *pass,
 unsigned passlen, const char *oldpass, unsigned oldpasslen,
 unsigned flags);
Use the sasl_setpass() interface to set passwords. sasl_setpass() uses the SASL_CB_SERVER_USERDB_SET<hy>
PASS callback, if one is supplied. Additionally, if any server mechanism plugins supply a setpass callback, the set<hy>
pass callback would be called. None of the server mechanism plugins currently supply a setpass callback.
conn The SASL connection context
user The username for which the password is set
pass The password to set
passlen The length of pass
oldpass The old password, which is optional
oldpasslen The length of oldpass, which is optional
flags Refers to flags, including, SASL_SET_CREATE and SASL_SET_DISABLE. Use these flags to create and
disable accounts.
sasl_setpass() returns an integer that corresponds to a SASL error code.
