dscfgadm -s
The dscfgadm command controls the Availability Suite configuration location and services by providing facilities to
set the configuration location, and to enable and disable the Availability Suite services.
If you do not specify any arguments to a dscfgadm command, the utility interactively steps you through setting the
configuration location and starting the services. The configuration location is validated to ensure it meets criteria
such as size and file type before it is initialized for use.
The dscfgadm command supports the following options.
-d [-r ]
Disables the Availability Suite SMF services. This includes stopping daemons and suspending any Point-in-Time
Copy or Remote Mirror sets that are currently enabled under the Availability Suite software. When executed with no
additional options, the -d option disables all Availability Suite services. This setting is persistent across system
boots.
-r
When passed to the -d or -e option, acts only on the Remote Mirror services.
-e [-r ] [-p]
Enables the Availability Suite SMF services. This includes starting daemons and resuming any Point-in-Time Copy
or Remote Mirror sets that have been previously configured under the Availability Suite software. When executed
with no additional options, the -e option enables all Availability Suite services. This setting is persistent across sys<hy>
tem boots.
-r
When passed to the -d or -e option, acts only on the Remote Mirror services.
-p
When passed to the -e option, enables only the Point-in-Time Copy service.
-i
Displays information on the Availability Suite SMF services.
-s
Allows you to set the location of the configuration database containing information specific to Sun Cluster configu<hy>
rations.
