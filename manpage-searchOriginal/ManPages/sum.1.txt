sum <-> print checksum and block count for a file
/usr/bin/sum [-abBchHlLpPrRstTw] [-x method] [file...]
sum [-abBchHlLpPrRstTw] [-x method] [file...]
The sum utility and ksh93 built-in command list the checksum, and for most methods the block count, for each file
argument. The standard input is read if there are no file arguments.
The getconf(1) UNIVERSE determines the default sum method: att for the att universe, bsd otherwise. The default
for the other commands is the command name itself. The att method is a true sum, all others are order dependent.
Method names consist of a leading identifier and 0 or more options separated by -.
getconf PATH_RESOLVE determines how symbolic links are handled. This can be explicitly overridden by the
--logical, --metaphysical, and --physical options below. PATH_RESOLVE can be one of:
--logical Follow all symbolic links.
--metaphysical Follow command argument symbolic links, otherwise do not follow.
--physical Do not follow symbolic links.
The following options are supported for /usr/bin/sum:
-a
--all
List the checksum for all files. Use with --total to list both individual and total checksums and block counts.
-b
--binary
Read files in binary mode. This is the default.
-B
--scale=scale
Block count scale (bytes per block) override for methods that include size in the output. The default is method-spe<hy>
cific.
-c
--check
Each file is interpreted as the output from a previous sum. If --header or --permissions was specified in the previous
sum then the checksum method is automatically determined, otherwise --method must be specified. The listed
checksum is compared with the current value and a warning is issued for each file that does not match. If file was
generated by --permissions, then the file mode, user and group are also checked. Empty lines, lines starting with
#<space>, or the line # are ignored. Lines containing no blanks are interpreted as [no]name[=value] options:
method=name
Checksum method to apply to subsequent lines.
permissions
Subsequent lines were generated with --permissions.
<beginning of page>
-h
--header
Print the checksum method as the first output line. Used with --check and --permissions.
-l
--list
Each file is interpreted as a list of files, one per line, that is checksummed.
-p
--permissions
If --check is not specified then list the file mode, user and group between the checksum and path. User and group
matching the caller are output as -. If --check is specified then the mode, user and group for each path in file are up<hy>
dated if necessary to match those in file. A warning is printed on the standard error for each changed file.
-R
--recursive
Recursively checksum the contents of directories.
-t
--total
List only the total checksum and block count of all files. --all --total lists each checksum and the total. The total
checksum and block count may be different from the checksum and block count of the catenation of all files due to
partial blocks that may occur when the files are treated separately.
-T
--text
Read files in text mode (for example, treat as 0.
-w
--warn
Warn about invalid --check lines. On by default; -w means --nowarn.
-x
--method|algorithm=method
Specifies the checksum method to apply. Parenthesized method options are readonly implementation details.
att|sys5|s5|default
The system 5 release 4 checksum. This is the default for sum when getconf UNIVERSE is att. This is the only true
sum; all of the other methods are order dependent.
ast4|32x4|tw
The ast 128 bit PRNG hash generated by catenating 4 separate 32 bit PNRG hashes. The block count is not printed.
bsd|ucb
The BSD checksum.
crc
32 bit CRC (cyclic redundancy check).
<beginning of page>
polynomial=mask
The 32 bit crc polynomial bitmask with implicit bit 32. The default value is 0xedb88320.
done[=number]
XOR the final crc value with number. 0xffffffff is used if number is omitted. The option value may be omitted. The
default value is 0.
init[=number]
The initial crc value. 0xffffffff is used if number is omitted. The option value may be omitted. The default value is 0.
rotate
XOR each input character with the high order crc byte (instead of the low order).
size[=number]
Include the total number of bytes in the crc. number, if specified, is first XOR'd into the size. The option value may
be omitted. The default value is 0.
prng
32 bit PRNG (pseudo random number generator) hash.
mpy=number The 32 bit PRNG multiplier. The default value is 0x01000193.
add=number The 32 bit PRNG addend. The default value is 0.
init[=number] The PRNG initial value. 0xffffffff is used if number is omitted. The option value may be omitted. The
default value is 0x811c9dc5.

The following operands are supported:
file A path name of a file. If no files are named, the standard input is used.
See largefile(5) for the description of the behavior of sum when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte (
2^31 bytes).
See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of sum:
LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.
The following exit values are returned.
0 Successful completion.

Read error is indistinguishable from end of file on most devices. Check the block count.
Portable applications should use cksum(1). The default algorithm for this command is defined in the POSIX stan<hy>
dard and is identical across platforms.
sum and usr/ucb/sum (see sum(1B)) return different checksums.
