makeuuid <-> generate Universal Unique Identifiers
makeuuid [-e ether] [-n count] [-R root]
The makeuuid command generates UUIDs (Universal Unique Identifiers) conforming to the OSF DCE specification
for UUIDs. The specification states:
"A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs. A UUID
can be used for  multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying
very persistent objects across a network.
"The generation of UUIDs does not require a registration authority for each single identifier. Instead, it requires a
unique value over space for each UUID generator. This spatially unique value is [normally] specified as an IEEE 802
address, which is usually already applied to network-connected systems."
The makeuuid command generates one or more UUIDs on the standard output.
The makeuuid command supports the following options:
-e ether Supplies an alternate address to be used in the generation of the UUIDs. Normally, the system's Ethernet ad<hy>
dress is acquired and used during the generation of a UUID. However, this requires root privileges to open and read
the network devices. If this is not possible, you must supply an alternate Ethernet address.
-n count Generate multiple UUIDs. This option generates the specified number of UUIDs, one per line. Using this
form is more efficient than, and functionally equivalent to, calling the makeuuid command multiple times. This can
be used, for example, when a large number of UUIDs need to be generated for a given application.
-R root Use root as the root filesystem path when updating the shared state file (see FILES). The shared state file
must be writable by the user running makeuuid, otherwise no UUIDs will be generated and the command will re<hy>
turn in failure. Note -
The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced with the -R option. Doing so might damage the
global zone's file system, might compromise the security of the global zone, and might damage the non-global
zone's file system. See zones(5).
Normally, you run the makeuuid command with root privileges, as the Ethernet address and state files can be easily
accessed and updated. If this is not possible, you must use the -R and -e options to specify an alternate root and Eth<hy>
ernet address to use when calculating the UUIDs. Example 1 Generating Multiple UUIDs
The following command generates 3000 UUIDs:
 example# makeuuid -n 3000
Example 2 Invoking Without Root Privileges
If you cannot obtain root privileges, you must specify an alternate Ethernet address and state file location:
 example% makeuuid -e 11:22:33:44:55:66 -R /export/root/example2
See the caveat on the use of the -R option in the description of that option, above.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.

/var/sadm/system/uuid_state
UUID state file. Use of time values is one way that UUID generators, such as makeuuid, guarantee uniqueness. A
state file is a mechanism that allows makeuuid to "remember" the last time value it used so it can increment that
value for use in a new UUID. See the Internet Draft "UUIDs and GUIDs," dated February 4, 1998, for details on the
state file mechanism.
