 gss_name_t *name, OM_uint32 *initiator_lifetime,
 OM_uint32 *acceptor_lifetime, gss_cred_usage_t *cred_usage);
acceptor_lifetime The number of seconds that the credential is capable of accepting security contexts under the spec<hy>
ified mechanism. If the credential can no longer be used to accept contexts, or if the credential usage for this mecha<hy>
nism is GSS_C_INITIATE, this parameter will be set to 0. Specify NULL if this parameter is not required.
cred_handle A handle that refers to the target credential. Specify GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL to inquire about the
default initiator principal.
cred_usage How the credential may be used with the specified mechanism. The cred_usage parameter may contain
one of the following values: GSS_C_INITIATE, GSS_C_ACCEPT, or GSS_C_BOTH. Specify NULL if this pa<hy>
rameter is not required.
initiator_lifetime The number of seconds that the credential is capable of initiating security contexts under the speci<hy>
fied mechanism. If the credential can no longer be used to initiate contexts, or if the credential usage for this mecha<hy>
nism is GSS_C_ACCEPT, this parameter will be set to 0. Specify NULL if this parameter is not required.
mech_type The mechanism for which the information should be returned.
minor_status A mechanism specific status code.
name The name whose identity the credential asserts. Any storage associated with this name must be freed by the
application after use by a call to gss_release_name(3GSS).
The gss_inquire_cred_by_mech() function obtains per-mechanism information about a credential.
The gss_inquire_cred_by_mech() function can return the following status codes:
GSS_S_COMPLETE Successful completion.
GSS_S_CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED The credentials cannot be added because they have expired.
GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_CREDENTIAL The referenced credentials are invalid.
GSS_S_FAILURE The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific GSS status code is defined.
The mechanism-specific status code reported by means of the minor_status parameter details the error condition.
GSS_S_NO_CRED The referenced credentials cannot be accessed.
GSS_S_UNAVAILABLE The gss_inquire_cred_by_mech() function is not available for the specified mechanism
type.
