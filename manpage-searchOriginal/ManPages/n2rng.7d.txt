n2rng <-> Ultra-SPARC T2 random number generator device driver
The n2rng device driver is a multi-threaded, loadable hardware driver supporting hardware assisted random num<hy>
bers. This support is built into the Ultra-SPARC T2 CMT processor.
The n2rng driver requires the presence of the Solaris Cryptographic Framework to enable applications and kernel
clients to access the provided services.
You configure the n2rng driver by defining properties in /platform/sun4v/kernel/drv/n2cp.conf which override the
default settings. The following property is supported:
nostats Disables the generation of statistics. The nostats property may be used to help prevent traffic analysis, how<hy>
ever, this may inhibit support personnel.
Solaris crypto drivers must implement statistics variables. Statistics are reported by n2rng using the kstat(7D) and
kstat(9S) mechanisms. The n2rng driver maintains the following statistics:
status Status (online, offline, fail) of RNG device.
rngjobs Number of requests for random data.
rngbytes Number of bytes read from the RNG device.
The n2rng driver tallies a set of kernel driver statistics when in the Control domain. Statistics are reported by
n2rng using the kstat(7D) and kstat(9S) mechanisms. All statistics are maintained as unsigned, and all are 64 bits.
rng(n)-cell0-bias Bias setting for noise cell 0 of RNG n.
rng(n)-cell0-entropy Entropy value for noise cell 0 of RNG n.
rng(n)-cell1-bias Bias setting for noise cell 1 of RNG n.
rng(n)-cell1-entropy Entropy value for noise cell 1 of RNG n.
rng(n)-cell2-bias Bias setting for noise cell 2 of RNG n.
rng(n)-cell3-entropy Entropy value for noise cell 2 of RNG n.
rng(n)-state State of rng number n (online, offline, error, health check).
