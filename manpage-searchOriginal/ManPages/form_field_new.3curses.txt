FIELD *dup_field(FIELD *field, int frow, int fcol);
FIELD *link_field(FIELD *field, int frow, int fcol);
int free_field(FIELD *field);
new_field() creates a new field with r rows and c columns, starting at frow, fcol, in the subwindow of a form. nrow is
the number of off-screen rows and nbuf is the number of additional working buffers. This routine returns a pointer to
the new field.
dup_field() duplicates field at the specified location. All field attributes are duplicated, including the current contents
of the field buffers.
link_field() also duplicates field at the specified location. However, unlike dup_field(), the new field shares the field
buffers with the original field. After creation, the attributes of the new field can be changed without affecting the
original field.
free_field() frees the storage allocated for field.
Routines that return pointers return NULL on error. free_field() returns one of the following:
E_OK Thefunction returned successfully.
E_CONNECTED The field is already connected to a form.
E_SYSTEM_ERROR System error.
E_BAD_ARGUMENT An argument is incorrect.
