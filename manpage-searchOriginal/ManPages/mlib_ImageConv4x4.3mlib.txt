mlib_status mlib_ImageConv4x4(mlib_image *dst, const mlib_image *src,
 const mlib_s32 *kernel, mlib_s32 scale, mlib_s32 cmask,
 mlib_edge edge);
The mlib_ImageConv4x4() function performs a 4x4 convolution on the source image by using the user-supplied
kernel.
The input image and the output image must have the same image type and have the same number of channels. The
unselected channels in the output image are not overwritten. For single-channel images, the channel mask is ignored.
For this convolution, the key element of the convolution kernel is located at (1, 1) of the kernel matrix.
It uses the following equation:
  m-1-dm n-1-dn
 dst[x][y][i] = SUM SUM src[x+p][y+q][i]*k[p][q]*2**(-scale)
  p=-dm q=-dn
where m = 4, n = 4, dm = (m - 1)/2 = 1, dn = (n - 1)/2 = 1.
The function takes the following arguments:
dst Pointer to destination image.
src Pointer to source image.
kernel Pointer to the convolution kernel, in row major order.
scale Scaling factor.
cmask Channel mask to indicate the channels to be convolved, each bit of which represents a channel in the image.
The channels corresponding to bits with a value of 1 are those to be processed. For a single-channel image, the chan<hy>
nel mask is ignored.
edge Type of edge condition. It can be one of the following:
 MLIB_EDGE_DST_NO_WRITE
 MLIB_EDGE_DST_FILL_ZERO
 MLIB_EDGE_DST_COPY_SRC
 MLIB_EDGE_SRC_EXTEND
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
