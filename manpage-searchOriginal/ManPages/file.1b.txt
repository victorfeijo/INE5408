file <-> determine the type of a file by examining its contents
/usr/ucb/file [-f ffile] [-cL] [-m mfile] filename...
file performs a series of tests on each filename in an attempt to determine what it contains. If the contents of a file
appear to be ASCII text, file examines the first 512 bytes and tries to guess its language.
file uses the file /etc/magic to identify files that have some sort of magic number, that is, any file containing a nu<hy>
meric or string constant that indicates its type.
-c Check for format errors in the magic number file. For reasons of efficiency, this validation is not normally carried
out. No file type-checking is done under -c.
-f ffile Get a list of filenames to identify from ffile.
-L If a file is a symbolic link, test the file the link references rather than the link itself.
-m mfile Use mfile as the name of an alternate magic number file.
Example 1 Using file on all the files in a specific user's directory.
This example illustrates the use of file on all the files in a specific user's directory:
 example% pwd
 /usr/blort/misc
 example% /usr/ucb/file *
 code: mc68020 demand paged executable
 code.c: c program text
 counts: ascii text
 doc: roff,nroff, or eqn input text
 empty.file: empty
 libz: archive random library
 memos: directory
 project: symboliclink to /usr/project
 script: executable shell script
 titles: ascii text
 s5.stuff: cpio archive
 example%
The environment variables LC_CTYPE, LANG, and LC_default control the character classification throughout
file. On entry to file, these environment variables are checked in the following order: LC_CTYPE, LANG, and
LC_default. When a valid value is found, remaining environment variables for character classification are ignored.
For example, a new setting for LANG does not override the current valid character classification rules of
LC_CTYPE. When none of the values is valid, the shell character classification defaults to the POSIX.1 "C" lo<hy>
cale.

file often makes mistakes. In particular, it often suggests that command files are C programs.
file does not recognize Pascal or LISP.
