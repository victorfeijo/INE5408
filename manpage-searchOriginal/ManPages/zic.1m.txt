zic <-> time zone compiler
zic [--version] [-s] [-v] [-l localtime] [-p posixrules]
 [-d directory] [-y yearistype] [filename]...
zic reads text from the file(s) named on the command line and creates the time conversion information files specified
in this input. If a filename is '<mi>', the standard input is read.
Input lines are made up of fields. Fields are separated by any number of white space characters. Leading and trailing
white space on input lines is ignored. A pound sign (#) indicates a comment that extends to the end of the line.
White space characters and pound signs can be enclosed within double quotes (" ") if they are to be used as part of a
field. Any line that is blank (after comment stripping) is ignored. Non-blank lines are expected to be of one of three
types: rule lines, zone lines, or link lines.
A rule line has the form:
For example:
 Rule NAME FROM TO TYPE IN ON AT SAVE LETTER/S
The fields that make up a rule line are:
 Rule USA 1969 1973 - Apr lastSun 2:00 1:00 D
NAME Gives the (arbitrary) name of the set of rules this rule is part of.
FROM Gives the first year in which the rule applies. The word minimum (or an abbreviation) means the minimum
year with a representable time value. The word maximum (or an abbreviation) means the maximum year with a rep<hy>
resentable time value.
TO Gives the final year in which the rule applies. In addition to minimum and maximum (as above), the word only
(or an abbreviation) can be used to repeat the value of the FROM field.
TYPE Gives the type of year in which the rule applies. If TYPE is:
'<mi>' The rule applies in all years between FROM and TO, inclusive.
uspres The rule applies in U.S. Presidential election years.
nonpres The rule applies in years other than U.S. Presidential election years.
even The rule applies to even-numbered years.
odd The rule applies to odd-numbered years.
If TYPE is something else, then zic will attempt to execute the command
 yearistype year type
to check the type of a year: an exit status of 0 means that the year is of the given type; an exit status of 1 means that
the year is not of the given type. The yearistype command is not currently provided in the Solaris environment.
<beginning of page>
IN Names the month in which the rule takes effect. Month names can be abbreviated.
ON Gives the day on which the rule takes effect. Recognized forms include:
5 the fifth day of the month
lastSun The last Sunday in the month
lastMon The last Monday in the month
Sun>=8 First Sunday on or after the eighth
Sun<=25 Last Sunday on or before the 25th
Names of days of the week can be abbreviated or spelled out in full. Note: There cannot be spaces within the ON
field.
AT Gives the time of day at which the rule takes effect. Recognized forms include:
2 Time in hours
2:00 Time in hours and minutes
15:00 24-hour format time (for times after noon)
1:28:14 Time in hours, minutes, and seconds, where hour 0 is midnight at the start of the day and hour 24 is mid<hy>
night at the end of the day.
Any of these forms can be followed by the letter w if the given time is local "wall clock" time; s if the given time is
local "standard" time; or u (or g or z) if the given time is universal time. In the absence of an indicator, wall clock
time is assumed.
SAVE Gives the amount of time to be added to local standard time when the rule is in effect. This field has the same
format as the AT field (without the w and s suffixes).
LETTER/S Gives the "variable part" (for example, the "S" or "D" in "EST" or "EDT" of time zone abbreviations to
be used when this rule is in effect. If this field is '<mi>', the variable part is null.
A zone line has the form:
 Zone NAME GMTOFF RULES/SAVE FORMAT [UNTIL]
For example:
 Zone Australia/SouthWest 9:30 - CST 1992 Mar 15 12:00
  8:30 Aus CST
The fields that make up a zone line are:
<beginning of page>
NAME The name of the time zone. This is the name used in creating the time conversion information file for the
zone.
GMTOFF The amount of time to add to UTC to get standard time in this zone. This field has the same format as
the AT and SAVE fields of rule lines; begin the field with a minus sign to subtract time from UTC.
RULES/SAVE The name of the rule(s) that apply in the time zone or, alternately, an amount of time to add to local
standard time. If this field is `<mi>', then standard time always applies in the time zone.
FORMAT The format for time zone abbreviations in this time zone. The pair of characters %s is used to show
where the "variable part" of the time zone abbreviation goes. Alternately, a slash (/) separates standard and daylight
abbreviations.
UNTIL The time at which the UTC offset or the rule(s) change for a location. It is specified as a year, a month, a
day, and a time of day. The time of day has the same format as the AT field of rule lines. If this is specified, the time
zone information is generated from the given UTC offset and rule change until the time specified.
The month, day, and time of day have the same format as the IN, ON, and AT columns of a rule; trailing columns
can be omitted, and default to the earliest possible value for the missing columns.
The next line must be a "continuation" line. This line has the same form as a zone line except that the string "Zone"
and the name are omitted. The continuation line places information starting at the time specified as the UNTIL field
in the previous line in the file used by the previous line. Continuation lines can contain an UNTIL field, just as zone
lines do, indicating that the next line is a further continuation.
A link line has the form:
 Link LINK-FROM LINK-TO
For example:
 Link Europe/Istanbul Asia/Istanbul
The LINK-FROM field should appear as the NAME field in some zone line; the LINK-TO field is used as an alter<hy>
nate name for that zone.
Except for continuation lines, lines can appear in any order in the input.
--version Outputs version information and exits.
-d directory Creates time conversion information files in the directory directory rather than in the standard directory
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo.
-l localtime Uses the given time zone as local time localtime. zic acts as if the file contained a link line of the form:
 Link localtime localtime
-p posixrules Uses the rules of the given time zone posixrules when handling POSIX-format time zone environment
variables. zic acts as if the input contained a link line of the form:
 Link posixrules posixrules
<beginning of page>
This option is not used by ctime(3C) and mktime(3C) in the Solaris environment.
-s Limits time values stored in output files to values that are the same whether they are taken to be signed or un<hy>
signed. You can use this option to generate SVVS-compatible files.
This option is obsolete and may be removed in a future release.
-v Complains if a year that appears in a data file is outside the range of years representable by system time values
(0:00:00 a.m. UTC, January 1, 1970, to 3:14:07 a.m. UTC, January 19, 2038). This option also complains if a
time of 24:00 (which cannot be handled by pre-1998 versions of zic) appears in the input.
-y yearistype Uses the given command yearistype rather than yearistype when checking year types (see Rules under
DESCRIPTION).
filename A file containing input lines that specify the time conversion information files to be created. If a filename is
'<mi>', the standard input is read.
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo
Standard directory used for created files
/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/src
Directory containing source files

For areas with more than two types of local time, you might need to use local standard time in the AT field of the
earliest transition time's rule to ensure that the earliest transition time recorded in the compiled file is correct.
If the current timezone file is edited and compiled using the "zic" command, the changes will only be reflected in any
new processes that are running. The most accurate way to reflect the changes for the whole system would be a re<hy>
boot.
