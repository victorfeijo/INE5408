niscat <-> display NIS+ tables and objects
niscat [-AhLMv] [-s sep] tablename...
niscat [-ALMP] -o name...
In the first synopsis, niscat displays the contents of the NIS+ tables named by tablename. In the second synopsis, it
displays the internal representation of the NIS+ objects named by name.
Columns without values in the table are displayed by two adjacent separator characters.
The following options are supported:
-A Displays the data within the table and all of the data in tables in the initial table's concatenation path.
-h Displays the header line prior to displaying the table. The header consists of the `#' (hash) character followed by
the name of each column. The column names are separated by the table separator character.
-L Follows links. When this option is specified, if tablename or name names a LINK type object, the link is followed
and the object or table named by the link is displayed.
-M Master server only. This option specifies that the request should be sent to the master server of the named data.
This guarantees that the most up-to-date information is seen at the possible expense of increasing the load on the
master server and increasing the possibility of the NIS+ server being unavailable or busy for updates.
-o name Displays the internal representation of the named NIS+ object(s). If name is an indexed name (see nis<hy>
match(1)), then each of the matching entry objects is displayed. This option is used to display access rights and oth<hy>
er attributes of individual columns.
-P Follows concatenation path. This option specifies that the request should follow the concatenation path of a table
if the initial search is unsuccessful. This option is only useful when using an indexed name for name and the -o op<hy>
tion.
-s sep This option specifies the character to use to separate the table columns. If no character is specified, the default
separator for the table is used.
-v Displays binary data directly. This option displays columns containing binary data on the standard output. With<hy>
out this option binary data is displayed as the string *BINARY*.
Example 1 Displaying the Contents of the Hosts Table
The following example displays the contents of the hosts table:
 example% niscat -h hosts.org_dir
 # cname name addr comment
 client1 client1 192.168.201.100 Joe Smith
 crunchy crunchy 192.168.201.44 Jane Smith
 crunchy softy 192.168.201.44
The string *NP* is returned in those fields where the user has insufficient access rights.
Example 2 Displaying on the Standard Output
The following displays the passwd.org_dir on the standard output.
<beginning of page>
 example% niscat passwd.org_dir
Example 3 Displaying Table Contents
Display the contents of table frodo and the contents of all tables in its concatenation path.
 example% niscat -A frodo
Example 4 Displaying Table Entries
The following example diisplays the entries in the table groups.org_dir as NIS+ objects. Notice that the brackets
are protected from the shell by single quotes.
 example% niscat -o '[ ]groups.org_dir'
Example 5 Displaying the Table Object
The following example displays the table object of the passwd.org_dir table.
 example% niscat -o passwd.org_dir
The previous example displays the passwd table object and not the passwd table. The table object includes informa<hy>
tion such as the number of columns, column type, searchable or not searchable separator, access rights, and other de<hy>
faults.
Example 6 Displaying the Directory Object
The following example displays the directory object for org_dir, which includes information such as the access
rights and replica information.
 example% niscat -o org_dir
NIS_PATH If this variable is set, and the NIS+ table name is not fully qualified, each directory specified will be
searched until the table is found (see nisdefaults(1)).
niscat returns the following values:
0 Successful completion
1 An error occurred.

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
