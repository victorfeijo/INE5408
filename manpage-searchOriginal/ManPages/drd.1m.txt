drd <-> Logical Domain Dynamic Reconfiguration daemon
/usr/lib/ldoms/drd
The drd daemon is part of the framework that enables the addition and removal of resources from a Logical Do<hy>
main. This framework is collectively called Dynamic Reconfiguration (DR).
drd is responsible for various aspects of DR on a Logical Domain and must be enabled to ensure proper DR func<hy>
tionality. It is started at boot time and has no configuration options.

drd uses syslog(3C) to report status and error messages. All of the messages are logged with the LOG_DAEMON
facility. Error messages are logged with the LOG_ERR and LOG_NOTICE priorities, and informational messages
are logged with the LOG_INFO priority. The default entries in the /etc/syslog.conf file log all the drd error mes<hy>
sages to the /var/adm/messages log.
The drd service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/platform/sun4v/drd:default
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). The service's status can be queried using the svcs(1) command.
