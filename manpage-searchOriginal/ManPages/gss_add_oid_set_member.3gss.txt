OM_uint32 gss_add_oid_set_member(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
 const gss_OID member_oid, gss_OID_set *oid_set);
The parameter descriptions for gss_add_oid_set_member() follow:
minor_status A mechanism specific status code.
member_oid Object identifier to be copied into the set.
oid_set Set in which the object identifier should be inserted.
The gss_add_oid_set_member() function adds an object identifier to an object identifier set. You should use this
function in conjunction with gss_create_empty_oid_set(3GSS) when constructing a set of mechanism OIDs for in<hy>
put to gss_acquire_cred(3GSS). The oid_set parameter must refer to an OID-set created by GSS-API, that is, a set
returned by gss_create_empty_oid_set(3GSS).
The GSS-API creates a copy of the member_oid and inserts this copy into the set, expanding the storage allocated to
the OID-set elements array, if necessary. New members are always added to the end of the OID set's elements. If
the member_oid is already present, the oid_set should remain unchanged.
The gss_add_oid_set_member() function can return the following status codes:
GSS_S_COMPLETE
Successful completion.
GSS_S_FAILURE
The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific GSS status code is defined. The mechanism-spe<hy>
cific status code reported by means of the minor_status parameter details the error condition.
