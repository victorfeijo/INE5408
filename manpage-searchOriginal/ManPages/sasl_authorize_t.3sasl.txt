sasl_authorize_t() is a typedef function prototype that defines the interface associated with the
SASL_CB_PROXY_POLICY callback.
Use the sasl_authorize_t() interface to check whether the authorized user auth_identity can act as the user request<hy>
ed_user. For example, the user root may want to authenticate with root's credentials but as the user tmartin, with
all of tmartin's rights, not root's. A server application should be very careful when it determines which users may
proxy as other users.
conn The SASL connection context.
requested_user The identity or username to authorize. requested_user is null-terminated.
rlen The length of requested_user.
auth_identity The identity associated with the secret. auth_identity is null-terminated.
alen The length of auth_identity.
default_realm The default user realm as passed to sasl_server_new(3SASL).
ulren The length of the default realm
propctx Auxiliary properties
Like other SASL callback functions, sasl_authorize_t() returns an integer that corresponds to a SASL error code.
See <sasl.h> for a complete list of SASL error codes.
SASL_OK The call to sasl_authorize_t() was successful.
See sasl_errors(3SASL) for information on SASL error codes.
