DAT_RETURN
 dat_cr_reject (
 IN DAT_CR_HANDLE cr_handle
 )
cr_handle Handle to an instance of a Connection Request that the Consumer is rejecting.
The dat_cr_reject() function rejects a Connection Request from the Active remote side requesting Endpoint. If the
Provider passed a local Endpoint into a Consumer for the Public Service Point-created Connection Request, that
Endpoint reverts to Provider Control. The behavior of an operation on that Endpoint is undefined. The local End<hy>
point that the Consumer provided for Reserved Service Point reverts to Consumer control, and the Consumer is free
to use in any way it wants.
The operation is synchronous. This operation also destroys the Connection Request instance. Use of the handle of
the destroyed Connection Request in any consequent operation fails.
DAT_SUCCESS The operation was successful.
DAT_INVALID_HANDLE The cr_handle parameter is invalid.
