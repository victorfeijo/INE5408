logger <-> add entries to the system log
logger [-i] [-f file] [-p priority] [-t tag] [message] ...
The logger command provides a method for adding one-line entries to the system log file from the command line.
One or more message arguments can be given on the command line, in which case each is logged immediately. If
this is unspecified, either the file indicated with -f or the standard input is added to the log. Otherwise, a file can be
specified, in which case each line in the file is logged. If neither is specified, logger reads and logs messages on a
line-by-line basis from the standard input.
The following options are supported:
-ffile Uses the contents of file as the message to log.
-i Logs the process ID of the logger process with each line.
-ppriority Enters the message with the specified priority. The message priority can be specified numerically, or as a
facility.level pair. For example, `-p local3.info' assigns the message priority to the info level in the local3 facility.
The default priority is user.notice.
-ttag Marks each line added to the log with the specified tag.
The following operand is supported:
message One of the string arguments whose contents are concatenated together, in the order specified, separated by
single space characters.
Example 1 Examples of the logger command
The following example:
 example% logger System rebooted
logs the message `System rebooted' to the default priority level notice to be treated by syslogd as are other mes<hy>
sages to the facility user.
The next example:
 example% logger -p local0.notice -t HOSTIDM -f /dev/idmc
reads from the file /dev/idmc and logs each line in that file as a message with the tag `HOSTIDM' at priority level
notice to be treated by syslogd as are other messages to the facility local0.
