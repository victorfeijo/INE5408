 (tnfctl_handle_t *, tnfctl_probe_t *), void (*destroy_func)(void *));
The function tnfctl_register_funcs() is used to store client-specific data on a per-probe basis. It registers a creator
and a destructor function with hndl, either of which can be NULL. The creator function is called for every probe
that currently exists in hndl. Every time a new probe is discovered, that is brought in by dlopen(3C), create_func is
called.
The return value of the creator function is stored as part of the probe state and can be retrieved by tn<hy>
fctl_probe_state_get(3TNF) in the member field client_registered_data.
destroy_func is called for every probe handle that is freed. This does not necessarily happen at the time dlclose(3C)
frees the shared object. The probe handles are freed only when hndl is closed by tnfctl_close(3TNF). If tnfctl_regis<hy>
ter_funcs() is called a second time for the same hndl, then the previously registered destructor function is called first
for all of the probes.
tnfctl_register_funcs() returns TNFCTL_ERR_NONE upon success.
TNFCTL_ERR_INTERNAL An internal error occurred.
