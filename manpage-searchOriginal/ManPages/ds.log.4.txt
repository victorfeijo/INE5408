ds.log <-> Availability Suite data services log file
The /var/adm/ds.log file contains the Availability Suite data services command log. The administration commands
log activities to the file in the format:
 date time product: message
Note that when the size of the log file exceeds 10 Mbytes, ds.log is renamed /var/adm/ds.log.bak and a new
/var/adm/ds.log file is created.
The ds.log fields are:
date
The date format is mmm nn, where mmm is the local three-character abbreviation for the month and nn is the day of
the month on which the event occurred.
time
The time of the event, in hh:mm:ss format.
product
A product code that identifies which component of the data services produced the event. The code is separated from
the message that follows by a colon (:) and a space.
message
A message that can extend over more than one line describing the event that occurred. The second or following
lines are not prefixed by the date, time, and product code strings.
