mmsinit <-> initialize MMS services
/usr/bin/mmsinit -t server [-o optionname=value [-o optionname2=value]...]
 [-P passwordfile]
The mmsinit command initializes the Media Management System (MMS) environment and enables MMS services.
An MMS server runs the Media Management (MM) daemon, which controls access to MMS-managed storage re<hy>
sources, and hosts the MMS database. Run this command once to start MMS services with the specified attributes.
To change the attributes after this command has been invoked, use the mmsadm(1M) command.
The mmsinit command requires the -t server argument, to specify the server on which MMS services will run.
To run mmsinit, you must become superuser, or assume the Primary Administrator role.
The following options are supported:
-o optionname=value...
Specify one or more of the options and values listed below.
log-level=emergency|alert|critical|error|warning|
notice|information|debug
Sets the severity level of messages to be included in the log file. Default level is error, logging all error messages.
num-restarts=num
Specifies the number of attempts to start a failed daemon before the drive or library associated with the daemon is
disabled and requires the mmsadm online command to be run after the problem with the system or device is re<hy>
solved. Use a value of -1 for unlimited restart attempts. The default value is 3.
attended=yes|no
Specify whether MMS makes operator requests when an operation cannot be automatically satisfied. An example of
such a case would be if a mount request was made for a tape volume that had been physically removed from a li<hy>
brary. The default action, yes, indicates that an operator is available to respond.
num-sockets=num
Specifies the number of open file descriptors the MM daemon can have at one time. On a resource-constrained sys<hy>
tem, set this value to a number between 30 and 65536. It is not recommended to set the value to less than 256. The
default value is -1, which sets number of file descriptors to the maximum supported.
disk-timeout=seconds
Specifies the time a disk archiving drive manager waits for the file system containing a disk archiving volume to be<hy>
come available. It is strongly recommended to set the time to a minimum of 120 seconds (two minutes). Use a value
of 0 to specify no expiration time.
-P passwordfile
Path to a file containing the MMS administrative password. If this option is not specified, the user will be prompted
for the password. A password must contain at least eight characters.
0
Successful completion.
!=0
An error occurred.

When MMS is added to the Automated Cartridge System Library Software (ACSLS) environment, the ACSLS con<hy>
figuration must be modified to allow them to work together. See the procedure for performing these modifications at
