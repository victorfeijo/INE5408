DAT_RETURN
 dat_srq_set_lw (
 IN DAT_SRQ_HANDLE srq_handle,
 IN DAT_COUNT low_watermark
 )
srq_handle A handle for an instance of a Shared Receive Queue.
low_watermark The low watermark for the number of Recv buffers on SRQ.
The dat_srq_set_lw() function sets the low watermark value for the SRQ and arms the SRQ for generating an asyn<hy>
chronous event for the low watermark. An asynchronous event will be generated when the number of buffers on the
SRQ is below the low watermark for the first time. This can occur during the current call or when an associated EP
takes a buffer from the SRQ.
The asynchronous event will be generated only once per setting of the low watermark. Once an event is generated,
no new asynchronous events for the number of buffers inthe SRQ below the specified value will be generated until
the SRQ is again set for the Low Watermark. If the Consumer is again interested in the event, the Consumer should
set the low watermark again.
DAT_SUCCESS The operation was successful.
DAT_INVALID_HANDLE The srq_handle argument is an invalid DAT handle.
DAT_INVALID_PARAMETER Invalid parameter; the value of low_watermark is exceeds the value of
max_recv_dtos.
DAT_MODEL_NOT_SUPPORTED The requested Model was not supported by the Provider. The Provider does
not support SRQ Low Watermark.
Upon receiving the asynchronous event for the SRQ low watermark, the Consumer can replenish Recv buffers on the
SRQ or take any other action that is appropriate.
Regardless of whether an asynchronous event for the low watermark has been generated, this operation will set the
generation of an asynchronous event with the Consumer-provided low watermark value. If the new low watermark
value is below the current number of free Receive DTOs posted to the SRQ, an asynchronous event will be generat<hy>
ed immediately. Otherwise the old low watermark value is simply replaced with the new one.
