rusers <-> who is logged in on remote machines
rusers [-ahilu] host...
The rusers command produces output similar to who(1), but for remote machines. The listing is in the order that re<hy>
sponses are received, but this order can be changed by specifying one of the options listed below.
The default is to print out the names of the users logged in. When the -l flag is given, additional information is print<hy>
ed for each user:
 userid hostname:terminal login_date login_time idle_time login_host
If hostname and login host are the same value, the login_host field is not displayed. Likewise, if hostname is not
idle, the idle_time is not displayed.
A remote host will only respond if it is running the rusersd daemon, which may be started up from inetd(1M) or lis<hy>
ten(1M).
In the absence of a name service, such as LDAP or NIS, rusers displays host names as numeric IP addresses.
-a Give a report for a machine even if no users are logged on.
-h Sort alphabetically by host name.
-i Sort by idle time.
-l Give a longer listing in the style of who(1).
-u Sort by number of users.
