Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI)
For usb_pipe_set_private():
pipe_handle Pipe handle into which user-defined data is placed.
data Data to store in the pipe handle.
For usb_pipe_get_private():
pipe_handle Pipe handle from which user-defined data is retrieved.
The usb_set_driver_private() function initializes the user-private data field of the pipe referred to by pipe_handle,
using data. The user-private data field is used to store any data the client desires and is not used in any way by the
USBA or OS framework. Client drivers often store their soft-state here for convenient retrieval by their callback han<hy>
dlers.
The usb_get_driver_private() function retrieves the user-private data stored via usb_set_driver_private(), from
the pipe referred to by pipe_handle.
For usb_pipe_set_private():
USB_SUCCESS Private data has been successfully stored in pipe handle.
USB_INVALID_PIPE pipe_handle argument is NULL or invalid.
Pipe is closing or closed.
USB_INVALID_PERM The pipe_handle argument refers to the default control pipe.
For usb_pipe_get_private():
On success: usb_opaque_t pointer to data being retrieved.
On failure: NULL. Fails if pipe handle is NULL or invalid. Fails if pipe handle is to a pipe which is closing or
closed.
May be called from user, kernel or interrupt context.
