int gethostname(char *name, size_t namelen);
The gethostname() function returns the standard host name for the current machine. The namelen argument speci<hy>
fies the size of the array pointed to by the name argument. The returned name is null-terminated, except that if
namelen is an insufficient length to hold the host name, then the returned name is truncated and it is unspecified
whether the returned name is null-terminated.
Host names are limited to 255 bytes.
On successful completion, 0 is returned. Otherwise, -1 is returned.
No errors are defined.
