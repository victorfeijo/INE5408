The ippool utility is used to manage information stored in the IP pools subsystem of IP Filter software. Configura<hy>
tion file information can be parsed and loaded into the kernel and currently configured pools can be removed,
changed, or inspected.
ippool's use is restricted through access to /dev/ippool. The default permissions of /dev/ippool require ippool to be
run as root for all operations.
The command line options used are divided into two sections: the global options and the instance-specific options.
ippool's use is restricted through access to /dev/ipauth, /dev/ipl, and /dev/ipstate. The default permissions of these
files require ippool to be run as root for all operations.
ippool supports the option categories described below.
The following global options are supported:
-d Toggle debugging of processing the configuration file.
-n Prevents ippool from doing anything, such as making ioctl calls, that would alter the currently running kernel.
-v Turn verbose mode on.
The following instance-specific options are supported:
-a Add a new data node to an existing pool in the kernel.
-A Add a new (empty) pool to the kernel.
-f file Read in IP pool configuration information from file and load it into the kernel.
-F Flush loaded pools from the kernel.
-h Display a list of pools of the type: hash loaded in the kernel.
<beginning of page>
-l Display a list of pools of the type: tree loaded in the kernel.
-r Remove an existing data node from a pool in the kernel.
-R Remove an existing pool from within the kernel.
-s Display IP pool statistical information.
The following, additional options are supported:
-i ipaddr[/netmask] Sets the IP address for the operation being undertaken with an all-one's mask or, optionally, a
specific netmask, given in either dotted-quad notation or as a single integer.
-m poolname Sets the pool name for the current operation.
-M core Specify an alternative path to /dev/kmem from which to retrieve statistical information.
-N namelist Specify an alternative path to lookup symbol name information when retrieving statistical information.
-o role Sets the role with which this pool is to be used. Currently only ipf, auth, and count are accepted as argu<hy>
ments to this option.
-S seed Sets the hashing seed to the number specified. For use with hash-type pools only.
-t type Sets the type of pool being defined. Must be one of pool, hash, or group-map.
-u When parsing a configuration file, rather than load new pool data into the kernel, unload it.
/dev/ippool Link to IP Filter pseudo device.
/dev/kmem Special file that provides access to virtual address space.
/etc/ipf/ippool.conf Location of ippool startup configuration file.
