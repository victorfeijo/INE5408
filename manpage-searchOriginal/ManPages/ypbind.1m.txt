ypbind <-> NIS binder process
/usr/lib/netsvc/yp/ypbind [-broadcast | -ypset | -ypsetme]
NIS provides a simple network lookup service consisting of databases and processes. The databases are stored at the
machine that runs an NIS server process. The programmatic interface to NIS is described in ypclnt(3NSL). Admin<hy>
istrative tools are described in ypinit(1M), ypwhich(1), and ypset(1M). Tools to see the contents of NIS maps are
described in ypcat(1), and ypmatch(1).
ypbind is a daemon process that is activated at system startup time from the svc:/network/nis/client:default ser<hy>
vice. By default, it is invoked as ypbind -broadcast. ypbind runs on all client machines that are set up to use NIS.
See sysidtool(1M). The function of ypbind is to remember information that lets all NIS client processes on a node
communicate with some NIS server process. ypbind must run on every machine which has NIS client processes.
The NIS server may or may not be running on the same node, but must be running somewhere on the network. If the
NIS server is a NIS+ server in NIS (YP) compatibility mode, see the NOTES section of the ypfiles(4)man page for
more information.
The information ypbind remembers is called a binding <em> the association of a domain name with a NIS server. The
process of binding is driven by client requests. As a request for an unbound domain comes in, if started with the
-broadcast option, the ypbind process broadcasts on the net trying to find an NIS server, either a ypserv process
serving the domain or an rpc.nisd process in "YP-compatibility mode" serving NIS+ directory with name the same
as (case sensitive) the domain in the client request. Since the binding is established by broadcasting, there must be
at least one NIS server on the net. If started without the -broadcast option, ypbind process steps through the list of
NIS servers that was created by ypinit -c for the requested domain. There must be an NIS server process on at least
one of the hosts in the NIS servers file. It is recommended that you list each of these NIS servers by name and nu<hy>
meric IP address in /etc/hosts. Though the practice is not recommended, NIS allows you to list servers by numeric
address only, bypassing /etc/hosts. In such a configuration, ypwhich(1) returns a numeric address instead of a name.
Once a domain is bound by ypbind, that same binding is given to every client process on the node. The ypbind
process on the local node or a remote node may be queried for the binding of a particular domain by using the yp<hy>
which(1) command.
If ypbind is unable to speak to the NIS server process it is bound to, it marks the domain as unbound, tells the client
process that the domain is unbound, and tries to bind the domain once again. Requests received for an unbound do<hy>
main will wait until the requested domain is bound. In general, a bound domain is marked as unbound when the
node running the NIS server crashes or gets overloaded. In such a case, ypbind will try to bind to another NIS serv<hy>
er using the process described above.ypbind also accepts requests to set its binding for a particular domain. The re<hy>
quest is usually generated by the ypset(1M) command. In order for ypset to work, ypbind must have been invoked
with flags -ypset or -ypsetme.
-broadcast
Send a broadcast datagram using UDP/IP that requests the information needed to bind to a specific NIS server. This
option is analogous to ypbind with no options in earlier Sun releases and is recommended for ease of use.
-ypset
Allow users from any remote machine to change the binding by means of the ypset command. By default, no one
can change the binding. This option is insecure.
-ypsetme
Only allow root on the local machine to change the binding to a desired server by means of the ypset command.
ypbind can verify the caller is indeed a root user by accepting such requests only on the loopback transport. By de<hy>
fault, no external process can change the binding.
/var/yp/binding/ypdomain/ypservers
Lists the servers to which the NIS client is allowed to bind.
/etc/inet/hosts
File in which it is recommended that NIS servers be listed.

ypbind supports multiple domains. The ypbind process can maintain bindings to several domains and their servers,
the default domain is the one specified by the domainname(1M) command at startup time.
The -broadcast option works only on the UDP transport. It is insecure since it trusts "any" machine on the net that
responds to the broadcast request and poses itself as an NIS server.
The ypbind service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/network/nis/client:default
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). The service's status can be queried using the svcs(1) command.
