newkey <-> create a new Diffie-Hellman key pair in the publickey database
newkey -h hostname [-s nisplus | nis | files | ldap]
newkey -u username [-s nisplus | nis | files | ldap]
newkey establishes new public keys for users and machines on the network. These keys are needed when using se<hy>
cure RPC or secure NFS service.
newkey prompts for a password for the given username or hostname and then creates a new public/secret Diffie-
Hellman 192 bit key pair for the user or host. The secret key is encrypted with the given password. The key pair can
be stored in the /etc/publickey file, the NIS publickey map, or the NIS+ cred.org_dir table.
newkey consults the publickey entry in the name service switch configuration file (see nsswitch.conf(4)) to deter<hy>
mine which naming service is used to store the secure RPC keys. If the publickey entry specifies a unique name ser<hy>
vice, newkey will add the key in the specified name service. However, if there are multiple name services listed,
newkey cannot decide which source to update and will display an error message. The user is required to specify the
source explicitly with the -s option.
In the case of NIS, newkey should be run by the superuser on the master NIS server for that domain. In the case of
NIS+, newkey should be run by the superuser on a machine which has permission to update the cred.org_dir table
of the new user/host domain.
In the case of NIS+, nisaddcred(1M) should be used to add new keys. newkey cannot be used to create keys other
than 192-bit Diffie-Hellman.
In the case of LDAP, newkey should be run by the superuser on a machine that also recognizes the directory manag<hy>
er's bind distinguished name (DN) and password to perform an LDAP update for the host.
-h hostname Create a new public/secret key pair for the privileged user at the given hostname. Prompts for a pass<hy>
word for the given hostname.
-u username Create a new public/secret key pair for the given username. Prompts for a password for the given user<hy>
name.
-s nisplus
-s nis
-s files
-s ldap Update the database in the specified source: nisplus (for NIS+), nis (for NIS), files, or ldap (LDAP). Other
sources may be available in the future.

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
NIS+ to LDAP are available in the current Solaris release. For more information, visit http://www.sun.com/directo<hy>
