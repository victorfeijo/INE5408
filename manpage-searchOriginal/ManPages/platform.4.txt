platform <-> directory of files specifying supported platforms
.platform
The Solaris operating environment release includes the .platform directory, a new directory on the Solaris CD im<hy>
age. This directory contains files (created by Sun and Solaris OEMs) that define platform support. These files are
generically referred to as platform definition files. They provide a means to map different platform types into a plat<hy>
form group.
Platform definition files in the .platform directory are used by the installation software to ensure that software appro<hy>
priate for the architecture of the system will be installed.
Sun provides a platform definition file named .platform/Solaris . This file is the only one that can define platform
groups to which other platform definition files can refer. For example, an OEM platform definition file can refer to
any platform group specified in the Solaris platform definition file.
Other platform definition files are delivered by OEMs. To avoid name conflicts, OEMs will name their platform defi<hy>
nition file with an OEM-unique string. OEMs should use whatever string they use to make their package names
unique. This unique string is often the OEM's stock symbol.
Comments are allowed in a platform definition file. A "#" begins a comment and can be placed anywhere on a line.
Platform definition files are composed of keyword-value pairs, and there are two kinds of stanzas in the file: platform
group definitions and platform identifications. <bu> Platform group definitions:
The keywords in a platform group definition stanza are:
PLATFORM_GROUP The PLATFORM_GROUP keyword must be the first keyword in the platform group defi<hy>
nition stanza. The value assigned to this keyword is the name of the platform group, for example:
PLATFORM_GROUP=sun4c
The PLATFORM_GROUP name is an arbitrary name assigned to a group of platforms. However, PLAT<hy>
FORM_GROUP typically equals the output of the uname -m command. PLATFORM_GROUP value cannot
have white space and is limited to 256 ASCII characters.
INST_ARCH The instruction set architecture of all platforms in the platform group, for example:
INST_ARCH=sparc
The INST_ARCH keyword value must be the value returned by the uname -p command on all platforms in the
platform group.
<bu> Platform identifications:
The keywords in a platform identification stanza are:
PLATFORM_NAME The PLATFORM_NAME keyword must be the first keyword in the platform identification
stanza. The PLATFORM_NAME is the name assigned to the platform, for example:
PLATFORM_NAME=SUNW,SPARCstation-5
Typically, this name is the same as the value returned by the uname -icommand on the machine, but it need not be
the same.
The PLATFORM_NAME value cannot have white space and is limited to 256 ASCII characters. If it contains
parentheses, it must contain only balanced parentheses. For example. the string "foo(bar)foo" is a valid value for this
keyword, but "foo(bar" is not.
The other keywords in the platform identification stanza can be in any order, as long as the PLATFORM_NAME
keyword is first.

PLATFORM_ID The value returned by the uname -i command on the machine, for example:
PLATFORM_ID=SUNW,SPARCstation-5
MACHINE_TYPE The value returned by the uname -m command on the machine, for example:
MACHINE_TYPE=sun4c
IN_PLATFORM_GROUP The platform group of which the platform is a member, for example:
IN_PLATFORM_GROUP=sun4c
The platform group name must be specified in the same file as the platform identification stanza or in the platform
definition file with the name .platform/Solaris .
The IN_PLATFORM_GROUP keyword is optional. A platform doesn't have to belong to a platform group. If a
platform is not explicitly assigned to a platform group, it essentially forms its own platform group, where the plat<hy>
form group name is the PLATFORM_NAME value. The IN_PLATFORM_GROUP value typically equals the
output of the uname -m command. IN_PLATFORM_GROUP value cannot have white space and is limited to 256
ASCII characters.
INST_ARCH The instruction set architecture of the platform, for example:
INST_ARCH=sparc
This field is only required if the platform does not belong to a platform group. The INST_ARCH keyword value
must be the value returned by the uname -i command on all platforms in the platform group.
The installation program will remain compatible with the old Solaris CD format. If a Solaris CD image does not
contain any platform definition files, the installation and upgrade programs will select the packages to be installed
based on machine type, that is, the value returned by the uname -p command. Example 1 Platform Group Defini<hy>
tions
The following example shows platform group definitions from the .platform/Solaris platform definition file.
 #
 PLATFORM_GROUP=sun4u
 INST_ARCH=sparc
Example 2 Platform Identification Stanzas
The following example shows platform identification stanzas, which define systems that belong in a platform group,
from the .platform/Solaris platform definition file.
 #
 PLATFORM_NAME=SUNW,SunFire
 PLATFORM_ID=SUNW,SunFire
 IN_PLATFORM_GROUP=sun4u
 PLATFORM_NAME=SUNW,Ultra-80
 PLATFORM_ID=SUNW,Ultra-80
 IN_PLATFORM_GROUP=sun4u
 #
 PLATFORM_NAME=SUNW,SunFire
 PLATFORM_ID=SUNW,SunFire
 IN_PLATFORM_GROUP=sun4u
 #
 PLATFORM_NAME=SUNW,Ultra-80
<beginning of page>
 PLATFORM_ID=SUNW,Ultra-80
 IN_PLATFORM_GROUP=sun4u
The .platform directory must reside as /cd_image/Solaris_vers/.platform, where
cd_image Is the path to the mounted Solaris CD (/cdrom/cdrom0/s0 by default) or the path to a copy of the Solaris
CD on a disk.
Solaris_vers Is the version of Solaris, for example, Solaris_2.9.
Typically, a platform identification stanza contains either a PLATFORM_ID or a MACHINE_TYPE stanza, but
not both.
If both are specified, both must match for a platform to be identified as this platform type. Each platform identifica<hy>
tion stanza must contain either a PLATFORM_ID value or a MACHINE_TYPE value. If a platform matches two
different platform identification stanzas<em>one which matched on the value of PLATFORM_ID and one which
matched on the value of MACHINE_TYPE , the one that matched on PLATFORM_ID will take precedence.
The .platform directory is part of the Solaris CD image, whether that be the Solaris CD or a copy of the Solaris CD
on a system's hard disk.
