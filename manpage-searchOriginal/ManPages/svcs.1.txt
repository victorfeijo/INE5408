The svcs command displays information about service instances as recorded in the service configuration repository.
The first form of this command prints one-line status listings for service instances specified by the arguments. Each
instance is listed only once. With no arguments, all enabled service instances, even if temporarily disabled, are listed
with the columns indicated below.
The second form prints one-line status listings for the dependencies or dependents of the service instances specified
by the arguments.
The third form prints detailed information about specific services and instances.
The fourth form explains the states of service instances. For each argument, a block of human-readable text is dis<hy>
played which explains what state the service is in, and why it is in that state. With no arguments, problematic ser<hy>
vices are described.
Error messages are printed to the standard error stream.
The output of this command can be used appropriately as input to the svcadm(1M) command.
The following options are supported:
-? Displays an extended usage message, including column specifiers.
-a Show all services, even disabled ones. This option has no effect if services are selected.
-d Lists the services or service instances upon which the given service instances depend.
-D Lists the service instances that depend on the given services or service instances.
-H Omits the column headers.
-l (The letter ell.) Displays all available information about the selected services and service instances, with one ser<hy>
vice attribute displayed for each line. Information for different instances are separated by blank lines.
The following specific attributes require further explanation:
dependency Information about a dependency. The grouping and restart_on properties are displayed first and are
separated by a forward slash (/). Next, each entity and its state is listed. See smf(5) for information about states. In
addition to the standard states, each service dependency can have the following state descriptions:
absent No such service is defined on the system.
invalid The fault management resource identifier (FMRI) is invalid (see smf(5)).
multiple The entity is a service with multiple instances.
File dependencies can only have one of the following state descriptions:
<beginning of page>
absent No such file on the system.
online The file exists.
If the file did not exist the last time that svc.startd evaluated the service's dependencies, it can consider the depen<hy>
dency to be unsatisfied. svcadm refresh forces dependency re-evaluation.
unknown stat(2) failed for a reason other than ENOENT.
See smf(5) for additional details about dependencies, grouping, and restart_on values.
enabled Whether the service is enabled or not, and whether it is enabled or disabled temporarily (until the next sys<hy>
tem reboot). The former is specified as either true or false, and the latter is designated by the presence of (tempo<hy>
rary).
A service might be temporarily disabled because an administrator has run svcadm disable -t, used svcadm mile<hy>
stone, or booted the system to a specific milestone. See svcadm(1M) for details.
-o col[,col]... Prints the specified columns. Each col should be a column name. See COLUMNS below for available
columns.
-p Lists processes associated with each service instance. A service instance can have no associated processes. The
process ID, start time, and command name (PID, STIME, and CMD fields from ps(1)) are displayed for each
process.
-R FMRI-instance Selects service instances that have the given service instance as their restarter.
-s col Sorts output by column. col should be a column name. See COLUMNS below for available columns. Multiple
-s options behave additively.
-S col Sorts by col in the opposite order as option -s.
-v Without -x or -l, displays verbose columns: STATE, NSTATE, STIME, CTID, and FMRI.
With -x, displays extra information for each explanation.
With -l, displays user-visible properties in property groups of type application and their description.
-x Displays explanations for service states.
Without arguments, the -x option explains the states of services which: <bu> are enabled, but are not running. <bu> are pre<hy>
venting another enabled service from running.
The following operands are supported:
FMRI A fault management resource identifier (FMRI) that specifies one or more instances (see smf(5)). FMRIs can
be abbreviated by specifying the instance name, or the trailing portion of the service name. For example, given the
FMRI:
 svc:/network/smtp:sendmail
The following are valid abbreviations:
<beginning of page>
 sendmail
 :sendmail
 smtp
 smtp:sendmail
 network/smtp
The following are invalid abbreviations:
 mail
 network
 network/smt
If the FMRI specifies a service, then the command applies to all instances of that service, except when used with the
-D option.
Abbreviated forms of FMRIs are unstable, and should not be used in scripts or other permanent tools.
pattern A pattern that is matched against the FMRIs of service instances according to the "globbing" rules described
by fnmatch(5). If the pattern does not begin with svc:, then svc:/ is prepended. The following is a typical example
of a glob pattern:
 qexample% svcs \*keyserv\*
 STATE STIME FMRI
 disabled Aug_02 svc:/network/rpc/keyserv:default
FMRI-instance An FMRI that specifies an instance.
Column names are case insensitive. The default output format is equivalent to "-o state,stime,fmri". The default
sorting columns are STATE, STIME, FMRI.
CTID The primary contract ID for the service instance. Not all instances have valid primary contract IDs.
DESC A brief description of the service, from its template element. A service might not have a description avail<hy>
able, in which case a hyphen (<hy>) is used to denote an empty value.
FMRI The FMRI of the service instance.
INST The instance name of the service instance.
NSTA The abbreviated next state of the service instance, as given in the STA column description. A hyphen denotes
that the instance is not transitioning. Same as STA otherwise.
NSTATE The next state of the service. A hyphen is used to denote that the instance is not transitioning. Same as
STATE otherwise.
SCOPE The scope name of the service instance.
SVC The service name of the service instance.
<beginning of page>
STA The abbreviated state of the service instance (see smf(5)):
DGD degraded
DIS disabled
LRC legacy rc*.d script-initiated instance
MNT maintenance
OFF offline
ON online
UN uninitialized
Absent or unrecognized states are denoted by a question mark (?) character. An asterisk (*) is appended for in<hy>
stances in transition, unless the NSTA or NSTATE column is also being displayed.
See smf(5) for an explanation of service states.
STATE The state of the service instance. An asterisk is appended for instances in transition, unless the NSTA or
NSTATE column is also being displayed.
See smf(5) for an explanation of service states.
STIME If the service instance entered the current state within the last 24 hours, this column indicates the time that it
did so. Otherwise, this column indicates the date on which it did so, printed with underscores (_) in place of blanks.
Example 1 Displaying the Default Output
This example displays default output:
 example% svcs
 STATE STIME FMRI
 ...
 legacy_run 13:25:04 lrc:/etc/rc3_d/S42myscript
 ...
 online 13:21:50 svc:/system/svc/restarter:default
 ...
 online 13:25:03 svc:/milestone/multi-user:default
 ...
 online 13:25:07 svc:/milestone/multi-user-server:default
 ...
Example 2 Listing All Local Instances
This example lists all local instances of the service1 service.
 example% svcs -o state,nstate,fmri service1
 STATE NSTATE FMRI
 online - svc:/service1:instance1
 disabled - svc:/service1:instance2
<beginning of page>
Example 3 Listing Verbose Information
This example lists verbose information.
 example% svcs -v network/rpc/rstat:udp
 STATE NSTATE STIME CTID FMRI
 online - Aug_09 - svc:/network/rpc/rstat:udp
Example 4 Listing Detailed Information
This example lists detailed information about all instances of system/service3. Additional fields can be displayed, as
appropriate to the managing restarter.
 example% svcs -l network/rpc/rstat:udp
 fmri svc:/network/rpc/rstat:udp
 enabled true
 state online
 next_state none
 restarter svc:/network/inetd:default
 contract_id
 dependency require_all/error svc:/network/rpc/bind (online)
Example 5 Listing Processes
 example% svcs -p sendmail
 STATE STIME FMRI
 online 13:25:13 svc:/network/smtp:sendmail
  13:25:15 100939 sendmail
 13:25:15 100940 sendmail
Example 6 Explaining Service States Using svcs -x
(a) In this example, svcs -x has identified that the print/server service being disabled is the root cause of two services
which are enabled but not online. svcs -xv shows that those services are print/rfc1179 and print/ipp-listener. This
situation can be rectified by either enabling print/server or disabling rfc1179 and ipp-listener.
 example% svcs -x
 svc:/application/print/server:default (LP print server)
  State: disabled since Mon Feb 13 17:56:21 2006
 Reason: Disabled by an administrator.
  See: http://sun.com/msg/SMF-8000-05
  See: lpsched(1M)
 Impact: 2 dependent services are not running. (Use -v for list.)
(b) In this example, NFS is not working:
 example$ svcs nfs/client
 STATE STIME FMRI
 offline 16:03:23 svc:/network/nfs/client:default
(c) The following example shows that the problem is nfs/status. nfs/client is waiting because it depends on
nfs/nlockmgr, which depends on nfs/status:
<beginning of page>
 example$ svcs -xv nfs/client
 svc:/network/nfs/client:default (NFS client)
  State: offline since Mon Feb 27 16:03:23 2006
 Reason: Service svc:/network/nfs/status:default
  is not running because a method failed repeatedly.
  See: http://sun.com/msg/SMF-8000-GE
  Path: svc:/network/nfs/client:default
  svc:/network/nfs/nlockmgr:default
  svc:/network/nfs/status:default
  See: man -M /usr/share/man -s 1M mount_nfs
  See: /var/svc/log/network-nfs-client:default.log
 Impact: This service is not running.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful command invocation.
1 Fatal error.
