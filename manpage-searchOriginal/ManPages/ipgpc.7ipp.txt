ipgpc <-> IP Generic Packet Classifier
The IP Generic Packet Classifier (ipgpc) module provides packet classification at the Solaris IP layer. ipgpc is an
implementation of the Multi-Field (MF) classifier as described in RFC2475: An Architecture for Differentiated Ser<hy>
vices.
The classifier is configured, at startup or dynamically, using a set of "filters." Filters describe selectors that are
matched against input packets that are processed by the classifier. Some selectors feature exact matching data points,
while others utilize non-exact or wildcard data points.
Each filter is associated with a class describing the next actions to process a packet. There is a many-to-one (M-to-1)
mapping relationship between filters and a class. Additionally, each class is aware of which filters are associated
with it. A class is configured with a class name and a next action.
Unlike traditional classifiers used in edge routers, ipgpc is designed for a host or server device. A host-based classi<hy>
fier provides access to more resources and data than edge routers. User, project, and interface information are avail<hy>
able at the host.
The ipgpc module exports global and per-class statistics (available through kstat:)
Global statistics:
 module: ipgpc instance:<action id>
 name: ipgpc global stats class: <action name>
  crtime
  snaptime
  nbytes <number of classified bytes>
  nclasses <number of classes>
  nfilters <number of filters>
  npackets <number of classified packets>
  epackets <number of packets in error>
Per-class statistics:
 module: ipgpc instance:<action id>
 name: <class name> class: <action name>
  crtime
  snaptime
  last match <time of last match>
  nbytes <number of classified bytes>
  npackets <number of classified packets>
