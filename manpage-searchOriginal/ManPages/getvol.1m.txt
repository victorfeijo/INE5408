tion.
The following options are supported:
-n Runs the command in non-interactive mode. The volume is assumed to be inserted upon command invocation.
-l label Specifies that the label label must exist on the inserted volume (can be overridden by the -o option).
-f Formats the volume after insertion, using the format command defined for this device in the device table.
-F Formats the volume after insertion and places a file system on the device. Also uses the format command defined
