/usr/lib/inet/wanboot/keymgmt -i -k key_file -s keystore -o type=keytype
/usr/lib/inet/wanboot/keymgmt -x -f outfile -s keystore -o type=keytype
The keymgmt utility has two purposes: <bu> To take a raw key, stored in key_file, and insert it in the repository specified
by keystore. <bu> To extract a key of a specified type from the repository specified by keystore, depositing it in outfile.
outfile will be created if it does not already exist. The type of key being added or extracted is specified by keytype
and may have one of four values: 3des, aes, rsa, or sha1 (the last used by HMAC SHA-1). When extracting a key,
the first key with an OID matching the supplied type is used.
The following arguments are supported:
-i Used in conjunction with -k to insert a raw key in keystore.
-f outfile Used to specify a file to receive an extracted key.
-k key_file Used in conjunction with -i to specify the file in which a raw key is stored. This key will be inserted in
keystore.
-o type=keytype Specifies the type of key being inserted or extracted. Must be one of 3des, aes, rsa, or sha1.
-s keystore Specifies a repository in which a key will be inserted or from which a key will be extracted.
-x Used in conjunction with -f to extract a key of a specified type and deposit it in outfile.
