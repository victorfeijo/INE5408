sip_msg_t sip_create_response(sip_msg_t sip_request,
 int response_code, char *response_phase,
 char *totag, char *contact_uri);
The sip_create_response() function creates and returns a SIP message in response to the SIP request sip_request.
The response line in the resulting SIP message is created using the response code in response_code and the phrase
in response_phrase. The response line has the SIP-Version of "2.0". If a non-null totag is specified, the resulting SIP
response has a TO header with a tag value from totag. If totag is null and the response_code is anything other than
100 (TRYING), sip_create_response() adds a TO header with a randomly generated tag value. If the re<hy>
sponse_code is 100 and totag is null, the SIP response has a TO header without a tag parameter. If contact_uri is
non-null, a CONTACT header is added to the SIP response with the URI specified in contact_uri. The SIP re<hy>
sponse has the following headers copied from sip_request:
 All VIA headers
 FROM header
 TO header (with tag added, if required, as stated above)
 CALL-ID header
 CSEQ header
 All RECORD-ROUTE headers
The sip_create_response() function returns the resulting SIP message on success and NULL on failure.
The value of errno is not changed by these calls in the event of an error.
