These functions compute the exponent of x, which is the integral part of log(r) |x|, as a signed floating point value,
for non-zero x, where r is the radix of the machine's floating-point arithmetic, which is the value of FLT_RADIX
defined in the <float.h> header.
Upon successful completion, these functions return the exponent of x.
If x is subnormal: <bu> For SUSv3-conforming applications compiled with the c99 compiler driver (see standards(5)),
the exponent of x as if x were normalized is returned. <bu> Otherwise, if compiled with the cc compiler driver, <mi>1022,
<mi>126, and <mi>16382 are returned for logb(), logbf(), and logbl(), respectively.
If x is <+->0, a pole error occurs and logb(), logbf(), and logbl() return <mi>HUGE_VAL, <mi>HUGE_VALF, and
<mi>HUGE_VALL, respectively.
If x is NaN, a NaN is returned.
If x is <+->Inf, +Inf is returned.
These functions will fail if:
Pole Error The value of x is <+->0.
If the integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, the divide-by-zero floating-
point exception is raised.
The logb() function sets errno to EDOM if the value of x is 0.
An application wanting to check for exceptions should call feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these
functions. On return, if fetestexcept(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDER<hy>
FLOW) is non-zero, an exception has been raised. An application should either examine the return value or check
the floating point exception flags to detect exceptions.
An application can also set errno to 0 before calling logb(). On return, if errno is non-zero, an error has occurred.
The logbf() and logbl() functions do not set errno.
