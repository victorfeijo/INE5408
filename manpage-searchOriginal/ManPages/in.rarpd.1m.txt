in.rarpd, rarpd <-> DARPA Reverse Address Resolution Protocol server
/usr/sbin/in.rarpd [-d] -a
/usr/sbin/in.rarpd [-d] device unit
in.rarpd starts a daemon that responds to Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) requests. The daemon forks
a copy of itself that runs in background. It must be run as root.
RARP is used by machines at boot time to discover their Internet Protocol (IP) address. The booting machine pro<hy>
vides its Ethernet address in a RARP request message. Using the ethers and hosts databases, in.rarpd maps this
Ethernet address into the corresponding IP address which it returns to the booting machine in an RARP reply mes<hy>
sage. The booting machine must be listed in both databases for in.rarpd to locate its IP address. in.rarpd issues no
reply when it fails to locate an IP address.
in.rarpd uses the STREAMS-based Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI) message set to communicate directly with
the datalink device driver.
The following options are supported:
-a Get the list of available network interfaces from IP using the SIOCGIFADDR ioctl and start a RARP daemon
process on each interface returned.
-d Print assorted debugging messages while executing.
Example 1 Starting An in.rarpd Daemon For Each Network Interface Name Returned From /dev/ip:
The following command starts an in.rarpd for each network interface name returned from /dev/ip:
 example# /usr/sbin/in.rarpd -a
Example 2 Starting An in.rarpd Daemon On The Device /dev/le With The Device Instance Number 0
The following command starts one in.rarpd on the device /dev/le with the device instance number 0.
 example# /usr/sbin/in.rarpd le 0

The in.rarpd service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/network/rarp
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). The service's status can be queried using the svcs(1) command.
