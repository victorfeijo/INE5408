fmt <-> simple text formatters
fmt [-cs] [-w width | -width] [inputfile]...
fmt is a simple text formatter that fills and joins lines to produce output lines of (up to) the number of characters
specified in the -w width option. The default width is 72. fmt concatenates the inputfiles listed as arguments. If none
are given, fmt formats text from the standard input.
Blank lines are preserved in the output, as is the spacing between words. fmt does not fill nor split lines beginning
with a `.' (dot), for compatibility with nroff(1). Nor does it fill or split a set of contiguous non-blank lines which is
determined to be a mail header, the first line of which must begin with "From".
Indentation is preserved in the output, and input lines with differing indentation are not joined (unless -c is used).
fmt can also be used as an in-line text filter for vi(1). The vi command:
!}fmt
reformats the text between the cursor location and the end of the paragraph.
-c Crown margin mode. Preserve the indentation of the first two lines within a paragraph, and align the left margin of
each subsequent line with that of the second line. This is useful for tagged paragraphs.
-s Split lines only. Do not join short lines to form longer ones. This prevents sample lines of code, and other such
formatted text, from being unduly combined.
-w width | -width Fill output lines to up to width columns.
inputfile Input file.

The -width option is acceptable for BSD compatibility, but it may go away in future releases.
