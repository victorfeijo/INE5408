vmstat <-> report virtual memory statistics
vmstat [-cipqsS] [-T u | d] [disks] [interval [count]]
vmstat reports virtual memory statistics regarding kernel thread, virtual memory, disk, trap, and CPU activity.
On MP (multi-processor) systems, vmstat averages the number of CPUs into the output. For per-processor statis<hy>
tics, see mpstat(1M).
vmstat only supports statistics for certain devices. For more general system statistics, use sar(1), iostat(1M), or
sar(1M).
Without options, vmstat displays a one-line summary of the virtual memory activity since the system was booted.
During execution of the kernel status command, the state of the system can change. If relevant, a state change mes<hy>
sage is included in the vmstat output, in one of the following forms:
 <<device added: sd0>>
 <<device removed: sd0>>
 <<processors added: 1, 3>>
 <<processors removed: 1, 3>>
See for device naming conventions for disks.
The following options are supported:
-c Report cache flushing statistics. This option is obsolete, and no longer meaningful. This option might be removed
in a future version of Solaris.
-i Report the number of interrupts per device. count and interval does not apply to the -i option.
-p Report paging activity in details. This option will display the following, respectively:
epi Executable page-ins.
epo Executable page-outs.
epf Executable page-frees.
api Anonymous page-ins.
apo Anonymous page-outs.
apf Anonymous page-frees.
fpi File system page-ins.
fpo File system page-outs.
fpf File system page-frees.
When executed in a zone and if the pools facility is active, all of the above only report actitivity on the processors in
the processor set of the zone's pool.

-q Suppress messages related to state changes.
-s Display the total number of various system events since boot. count and interval does not apply to the -s option.
-S Report on swapping rather than paging activity. This option will change two fields in vmstat's ``paging'' display:
rather than the ``re'' and ``mf'' fields, vmstat will report ``si'' (swap-ins) and ``so'' (swap-outs).
-T u | d Specify u for a printed representation of the internal representation of time. See time(2). Specify d for stan<hy>
dard date format. See date(1).
The following operands are supported:
count Specifies the number of times that the statistics are repeated. count does not apply to the -i and -s options.
disks Specifies which disks are to be given priority in the output (only four disks fit on a line). Common disk names
are id, sd, xd, or xy, followed by a number (for example, sd2, xd0, and so forth).
interval Specifies the last number of seconds over which vmstat summarizes activity. This number of seconds re<hy>
peats forever. interval does not apply to the -i and -s options.
Example 1 Using vmstat
The following command displays a summary of what the system is doing every five seconds.

The fields of vmstat's display are
kthr Report the number of kernel threads in each of the three following states:
r the number of kernel threads in run queue
b the number of blocked kernel threads that are waiting for resources I/O, paging, and so forth
w the number of swapped out lightweight processes (LWPs) that are waiting for processing resources to finish.
<beginning of page>
memory Report on usage of virtual and real memory.
swap available swap space (Kbytes)
free size of the free list (Kbytes)
page Report information about page faults and paging activity. The information on each of the following activities is
given in units per second.
re page reclaims <em> but see the -S option for how this field is modified.
mf minor faults <em> but see the -S option for how this field is modified.
pi kilobytes paged in
po kilobytes paged out
fr kilobytes freed
de anticipated short-term memory shortfall (Kbytes)
sr pages scanned by clock algorithm
When executed in a zone and if the pools facility is active, all of the above (except for "de") only report activity on
the processors in the processor set of the zone's pool.
disk Report the number of disk operations per second. There are slots for up to four disks, labeled with a single let<hy>
ter and number. The letter indicates the type of disk (s = SCSI, i = IPI, and so forth); the number is the logical unit
number.
faults Report the trap/interrupt rates (per second).
in interrupts
sy system calls
cs CPU context switches
When executed in a zone and if the pools facility is active, all of the above only report actitivity on the processors in
the processor set of the zone's pool.
cpu Give a breakdown of percentage usage of CPU time. On MP systems, this is an average across all processors.
us user time
sy system time
id idle time
When executed in a zone and if the pools facility is active, all of the above only report actitivity on the processors in

the processor set of the zone's pool.

The -c option (Report cache flushing statistics) is not supported in this release.
