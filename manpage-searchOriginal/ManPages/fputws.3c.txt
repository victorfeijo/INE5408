fputws <-> put wide character string on a stream
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>
int fputws(const wchar_t *restrict s, FILE *restrict stream);
The fputws() function writes a character string corresponding to the (null-terminated) wide character string pointed
to by ws to the stream pointed to by stream. No character corresponding to the terminating null wide-character code
is written, nor is a NEWLINE character appended.
The st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the file will be marked for update between the successful execution of fputws()
and the next successful completion of a call to fflush(3C) or fclose(3C) on the same stream or a call to exit(2) or
abort(3C).
Upon successful completion, fputws() returns a non-negative value. Otherwise, it returns <mi>1, sets an error indicator
for the stream, and sets errno to indicate the error.
Refer to fputwc(3C).
