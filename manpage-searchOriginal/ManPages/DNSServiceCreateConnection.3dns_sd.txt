The DNSServiceCreateConnection() function allows the creation of a connection to the mDNS daemon in order to
register multiple individual records.
The DNSServiceRegisterRecord() function uses the connection created by DNSServiceCreateConnection() to
register a record. Name conflicts that occur from this function should be handled by the client in the callback.
The DNSServiceAddRecord() call adds a DNS record to a registered service. The name of the record is the same as
registered service name. The RecordRef argument to DNSServiceAddRecord() points to an uninitialized
DNSRecordRef. After successful completion of DNSServiceAddRecord(), the DNS record can be updated or
deregistered by passing the DNSRecordRef initialized by DNSServiceAddRecord() to DNSServiceUpdateRe<hy>
cord() or to DNSServiceRemoveRecord().
The DNSServiceUpdateRecords() call updates the DNS record of the registered service. The DNS record must be
the primary resource record registered using DNSServiceRegister() or a record added to a registered service using
DNSServiceAddRecord() or an individual record added via DNSServiceRegisterRecord().
The DNSServiceRemoveRecord() call removes a record that was added using DNSServiceAddRecord() or
DNSServiceRegisterRecord().
The sdRef argument points to DNSServiceRef initialized from a call to DNSServiceRegister(). If the sdRef argu<hy>
ment is passed to DNSServiceRefDeallocate() and the service is deregistered DNS records added via DNSSer<hy>
viceAddRecord() are invalidated and cannot be further used. The flags argument is currently ignored and reserved
for future use. The rrtype parameter value indicates the type of the DNS record. Suitable values for the rrtype pa<hy>
rameter are defined in <dns_sd.h>: kDNSServiceType_TXT, for example. The rdata argument points to the raw
rdata to be contained in the resource record. The ttl value indicates the time to live of the resource record in seconds.
A ttl value of 0 should be passed to use a default value.
The DNSServiceCreateConnection function returns kDNSServiceErr_NoError on success. Otherwise, an error
code defined in <dns_sd.h> is returned to indicate the specific failure that occurred.
