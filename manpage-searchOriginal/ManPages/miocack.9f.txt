miocack <-> Positively acknowledge an M_IOCTL message

void miocack(queue_t *wq, mblk_t *mp, intcount, int rval);
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
wq Write queue associated with the read queue to send the M_IOCACK on.
mp M_IOCTL message.
count Value to set the ioc_count of the iocblk(9S) to.
rval Value to set the ioc_rval of the iocblk(9S) to.
The miocack() function converts an M_IOCTL message into a M_IOCACK message and sends the resulting mes<hy>
sage upstream.
To convert the message, miocack() changes the message type to M_IOCACK, sets the 'ioc_count' and 'ioc_rval'
members of the iocblk(9S) associated with mp to the passed-in values, and clears the 'ioc_error' field. If the caller
specifies a non-zero value for count, it is expected that the caller has already set 'mp->b_cont' field to point to a
message block with a length of at least count bytes.
Callers that only need to perform the message conversion, or need to perform additional steps between the conver<hy>
sion and the sending of the M_IOCACK should use mioc2ack(9F).
None.
This function can be called from user, kernel or interrupt context.
Callers must not hold any locks across a miocack() that can be acquired as part of put(9E) processing.
