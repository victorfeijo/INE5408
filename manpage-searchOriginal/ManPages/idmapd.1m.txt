The idmapd service is managed by the service management facility (SMF). The service identifier for the idmapd
service is svc:/system/idmap.
Use the svcadm command to perform administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or restart<hy>
ing the service. These actions require the solaris.smf.manage.idmap authorization. Use the svcs command to query
the service's status.
The functionality of this daemon might change in a future release of the Solaris operating system.
