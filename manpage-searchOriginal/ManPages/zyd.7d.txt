zyd <-> ZyDAS ZD1211/ZD1211B USB 802.11b/g Wireless Driver
The zyd 802.11b/g wireless driver is a multi-threaded, loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based STREAMS driver sup<hy>
porting the ZyDAS ZD1211/ZD1211B USB chipset-based wireless devices.
The zyd driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rate and mode. Supported 802.11b data rates are 1,
2, 5.5 and 11 Mbits/sec. Supported 802.11g data rates are 1, 2, 5.5, 11, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 54 Mbits/sec. The
zyd driver supports only BSS networks (also known as "ap" or "infrastructure" networks) and open (or "open-sys<hy>
tem"), shared key and WPA/WPA2 authentication. Supported encryption types are WEP40, WEP104, TKIP and
AES-CCMP.
