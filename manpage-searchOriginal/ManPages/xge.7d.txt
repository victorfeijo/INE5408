xge <-> Neterion Xframe 10Gigabit Ethernet Network Adapter driver
/dev/xge
The xge 10 Gigabit Ethernet driver is a multi-threaded, loadable, clonable, GLD-based STREAMS driver support<hy>
ing the Data Link Provider Interface, dlpi(7P), on S2IO Xframe 10-Gigabit Ethernet Network Adapter.
The xge driver functions includes controller initialization, frame transmit and receive, promiscuous and multicast
support, TCP and UDP checksum offload (IPv4 and IPv6), 9622-byte jumbo frame, and error recovery and report<hy>
ing.
The xge driver and hardware support the 10GBase-SR/W, LR/W, and ER/W 802.3 physical layer.
The cloning, character-special device /dev/xge is used to access all Xframe devices installed within the system.
The xge driver is managed by the dladm(1M) command line utility, which allows VLANs to be defined on top of
xge instances and for xge instances to be aggregated. See dladm(1M) for more details.
The values returned by the driver in the DL_INFO_ACK primitive in response to the DL_INFO_REQ are as fol<hy>
lows: <bu> Maximum SDU is 9600. <bu> Minimum SDU is 0. <bu> DSLAP address length is 8 bytes. <bu> MAC type is
DL_ETHER. <bu> SAP length value is -2 meaning the physical address component is followed immediately by a
2-byte sap component within the DLSAP address. <bu> Broadcast address value is Ethernet/IEEE broadcast address
(FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF).
By default, the xge driver works without any configuration file.
You can check the running-time status of a device instance using ndd(1M). Currently, the driver provides an inter<hy>
face to print all hardware statistics.
For example, to print statistics of device xge0:
  #ndd /dev/xge0 stats
