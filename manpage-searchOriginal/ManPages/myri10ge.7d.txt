myri10ge <-> Myricom Myri10GE 10Gb PCI Express NIC Driver
/dev/myri10ge*
The myri10ge Gigabit Ethernet driver is a multi-threaded, loadable, clonable, GLD-based STREAMS driver that
supports the Data Link Provider Interface, dlpi(7P), on Myricom Myri10GE 10-Gigabit Ethernet controllers.
The myri10ge driver functions include controller initialization, frame transmit and receive, promiscuous and multi<hy>
cast support, multiple transmit and receive queues, support for TCP Large Send Offload, support for TCP Large Re<hy>
ceive Offload, and error recovery and reporting.
The cloning character-special device, /dev/myri10ge, is used to access all Myricom Myri10GE 10 -Gigabit Ethernet
dev ices installed within the system.
The myri10ge driver is managed by the dladm(1M) command line utility. dladm allows VLANs to be defined on
top of myri10ge instances and for myri10ge instances to be aggregated. See dladm(1M) for more details.
You must send an explicit DL_ATTACH_REQ message to associate the opened stream with a particular device
(PPA). The PPA ID is interpreted as an unsigned integer data type and indicates the corresponding device instance
(unit) number. The driver returns an error (DL_ERROR_ACK) if the PPA field value does not correspond to a valid
device instance number for the system. The device is initialized on first attach and de-initialized (stopped) at last de<hy>
tach.
The values returned by the driver in the DL_INFO_ACK primitive in response to your DL_INFO_REQ are: <bu>
Maximum SDU is 9000. <bu> Minimum SDU is 0. <bu> DLSAP address length is 8. <bu> MAC type is DL_ETHER. <bu> SAP
(Service Access Point) length value is -2, meaning the physical address component is followed immediately by a
2-byte SAP component within the DLSAP address. <bu> Broadcast address value is the Ethernet/IEEE broad- cast ad<hy>
dress (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF). <bu> Once in the DL_ATTACHED state, you must send a DL_BIND_REQ to associate
a particular SAP with the stream.
Link speed and mode can only be 10000 Mbps full-duplex. See the IEEE 802.3 Standard for more information.
