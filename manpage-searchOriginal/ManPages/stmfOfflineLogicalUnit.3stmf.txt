int stmfOfflineLogicalUnit(stmfGuid *logicalUnit);
logicalUnit The identifier of the logical unit to offline.
The stmfOfflineLogicalUnit() function takes offline a logical unit that is currently in the online state. Once in the
offline state, the logical unit will no longer be capable of servicing requests in the system.
This API call can be used to take offline a logical unit for servicing. Once the logical unit is offline, an initiator port
that attempts to issue any SCSI commands to the offlined logical unit will receive a check condition. For purposes of
the REPORT LUNS command, the logical unit will no longer appear in the logical unit inventory for any initiator
ports to which it is currently mapped by one or more view entries.
The following values are returned:
STMF_ERROR_BUSY The device is currently busy.
STMF_STATUS_SUCCESS The API call was successful.
