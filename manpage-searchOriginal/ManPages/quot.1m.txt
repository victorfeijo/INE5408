quot <-> summarize file system ownership
quot [-acfhnv] filesystem...
quot -a [-cfhnv]
quot displays the number of blocks (1024 bytes) in the named filesystem (one or more) currently owned by each us<hy>
er. There is a limit of 2048 blocks. Files larger than this will be counted as a 2048 block file, but the total block
count will be correct.
The following options are supported:
-a Generate a report for all mounted file systems.
-c Display three columns giving a file size in blocks, the number of files of that size, and a cumulative total of blocks
containing files of that size or a smaller size.
-f Display three columns giving, for each user, the number of blocks owned, the count of number of files, and the us<hy>
er name. This option is incompatible with the -c and -v options.
-h Estimate the number of blocks in the file. This does not account for files with holes in them.
-n Attach names to the list of files read from standard input. quot -n cannot be used alone, because it expects data
from standard input. For example, the pipeline
ncheck myfilesystem | sort +0n | quot -n myfilesystem
will produce a list of all files and their owners. This option is incompatible with all other options.
-v In addition to the default output, display three columns containing the number of blocks not accessed in the last
30, 60, and 90 days.
