nis_cachemgr <-> NIS+ utility to cache location information about NIS+ servers
/usr/sbin/nis_cachemgr [-i] [-v]
The nis_cachemgr daemon maintains a cache of NIS+ directory objects and active servers for domains. It is respon<hy>
sible for locating servers for a domain on behalf of client processes. This improves performance because only one
process has to search for servers. The cache contains location information necessary to contact the NIS+ servers.
This includes transport addresses, information neeeded to authenticate the server, and a time to live field which gives
a hint on how long the directory object can be cached. The cache helps to improve the performance of the clients
that are traversing the NIS+ name space. nis_cachemgr should be running on all the machines that are using NIS+.
However, it is not required that the nis_cachemgr program be running in order for NIS+ requests to be serviced.
The cache maintained by this program is shared by all the processes that access NIS+ on a machine. The cache is
maintained in a file that is memory mapped by all the processes. See mmap(2). On start up, nis_cachemgr initial<hy>
izes the cache from the cold start file and preserves unexpired entries that already exist in the cache file. See
nisinit(1M). Thus, the cache survives machine reboots.
The nis_cachemgr program is normally started from a system startup script. nisshowcache(1M) can be used to look
at the cached objects and active servers.
The nisprefadm(1M) command can be used to control which NIS+ servers the nis_cachemgr program will try to
select.
The nis_cachemgr program makes NIS+ requests under the NIS+ principal name of the host on which it runs. Be<hy>
fore running nis_cachemgr, security credentials for the host should be added to the cred.org_dir table in the host's
domain using nisaddcred(1M). Credentials of type DES will be needed if the NIS+ service is operating at security
level 2 (see rpc.nisd(1M)). See the section, below. Additionally, a "keylogin -r " should be done on the machine.
svc:/network/rpc/keyserv:default is required for NIS+ operation. See NOTES.
-i Force nis_cachemgr to ignore the previous cache file and reinitialize the cache from just the cold start file. By de<hy>
fault, the cache manager initializes itself from both the cold start file and the old cache file, thereby maintaining the
entries in the cache across machine reboots.
-v This flag sets verbose mode. In this mode, the nis_cachemgr program logs not only errors and warnings, but also
additional status messages. The additional messages are logged using syslog(3C) with a priority of LOG_INFO.

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
NIS+ to LDAP are available in the current Solaris release. For more information, visit http://www.sun.com/directo<hy>

The nis_cachemgr service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/network/rpc/nisplus:default
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). The service's status can be queried using the svcs(1) command.
