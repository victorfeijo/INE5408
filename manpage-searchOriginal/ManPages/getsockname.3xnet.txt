int getsockname(int socket, struct sockaddr *restrict address,
 socklen_t *restrict address_len);
The getsockname() function retrieves the locally-bound name of the specified socket, stores this address in the
sockaddr structure pointed to by the address argument, and stores the length of this address in the object pointed to
by the address_len argument.
If the actual length of the address is greater than the length of the supplied sockaddr structure, the stored address
will be truncated.
If the socket has not been bound to a local name, the value stored in the object pointed to by address is unspecified.
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned, the address argument points to the address of the socket, and the ad<hy>
dress_len argument points to the length of the address. Otherwise, <mi>1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the er<hy>
ror.
The getsockname() function will fail:
EBADF The socket argument is not a valid file descriptor.
EFAULT The address or address_len parameter can not be accessed or written.
ENOTSOCK The socket argument does not refer to a socket.
EOPNOTSUPP The operation is not supported for this socket's protocol.
The getsockname() function may fail if:
EINVAL The socket has been shut down.
ENOBUFS Insufficient resources were available in the system to complete the call.
ENOSR There were insufficient STREAMS resources available for the operation to complete.
