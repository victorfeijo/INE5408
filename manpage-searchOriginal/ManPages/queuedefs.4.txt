/etc/cron.d/queuedefs
The queuedefs file describes the characteristics of the queues managed by cron(1M). Each non-comment line in this
file describes one queue. The format of the lines are as follows:
q.[njobj][nicen][nwaitw]
The fields in this line are:
q The name of the queue. a is the default queue for jobs started by at(1); b is the default queue for jobs started by
batch (see at(1)); c is the default queue for jobs run from a crontab(1) file.
njob The maximum number of jobs that can be run simultaneously in that queue; if more than njob jobs are ready to
run, only the first njob jobs will be run, and the others will be run as jobs that are currently running terminate. The
default value is 100.
nice The nice(1) value to give to all jobs in that queue that are not run with a user ID of super-user. The default val<hy>
ue is 2.
nwait The number of seconds to wait before rescheduling a job that was deferred because more than njob jobs were
running in that job's queue, or because the system-wide limit of jobs executing has been reached. The default value
is 60.
Lines beginning with # are comments, and are ignored. Example 1 A sample file.

This file specifies that the a queue, for at jobs, can have up to 4 jobs running simultaneously; those jobs will be run
with a nice value of 1. As no nwait value was given, if a job cannot be run because too many other jobs are running
cron will wait 60 seconds before trying again to run it.
The b queue, for batch(1) jobs, can have up to 2 jobs running simultaneously; those jobs will be run with a nice(1)
value of 2. If a job cannot be run because too many other jobs are running, cron(1M) will wait 90 seconds before
trying again to run it. All other queues can have up to 100 jobs running simultaneously; they will be run with a nice
value of 2, and if a job cannot be run because too many other jobs are running cron will wait 60 seconds before try<hy>
ing again to run it.
