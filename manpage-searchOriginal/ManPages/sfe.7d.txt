sfe <-> SiS900 series Fast Ethernet device driver
/dev/sfe
The sfe driver is a loadable, clonable, GLD-based STREAMS driver supporting the Data Link Provider Interface
dlpi(7P) on Silicon Integrated Systems 900 series Fast Ethernet controllers.
The relevant fields returned as part of a DL_INFO_ACK response are: <bu> Maximum SDU is 1500. <bu> Minimum SDU
is 0. <bu> The dlsap address length is 8. <bu> MAC type is DL_ETHER. <bu> SAP length is -2. The 6-byte physical address
is followed immediately by a 2-byte SAP. <bu> Service mode is DL_CLDLS. <bu> Broadcast address is the 6-byte Ether<hy>
net broadcast address (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff).
If the SAP provided is zero, then IEEE 802.3 mode is assumed and outbound frames will have the frame payload
length written into the type field. Likewise, inbound frames with a SAP between zero and 1500 are interpreted as
IEEE 802.3 frames and delivered to any streams that are bound to SAP zero (the 802.3 SAP).
The following properties may be configured using either ndd(1M) or the sfe.conf configuration file as described
by driver.conf(4):
adv_100fdx_cap
Enables the 100 Base TX full-duplex link option. (This is generally the fastest mode if both link partners support it.
Most modern equipment supports this mode.)
adv_100hdx_cap
Enables the 100 Base TX half-duplex link option. (Typically used when the link partner is a 100 Mbps hub.)
adv_10fdx_cap
Enables the 10 Base-T full-duplex link option. (This less-frequently used mode is typically used when the link part<hy>
ner is a 10 Mbps switch.)
adv_10hdx_cap
Enables the 10 Base-T half-duplex link option. (This is the fall-back when no other option is available. It is typical<hy>
ly used when the link partner is a 10 Mbps hub or is an older network card.)
