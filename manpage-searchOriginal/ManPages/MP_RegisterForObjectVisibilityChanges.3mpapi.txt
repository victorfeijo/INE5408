#include <mpapi.h>
MP_STATUS MP_RegisterForObjectVisibilityChanges(
 MP_OBJECT_PROPERTY_FN pClientFn, MP_OBJECT_TYPE objectType,
 void *pCallerData, MP_OID pluginOid);
pClientFn A pointer to an object ID that has type MP_OBJECT_VISIBILITY_FN function defined by the client.
With a successful return, this function is called to inform the client of objects that have had one or more properties
changed.
objectType The type of object the client wishes to register for property change callbacks.
pCallerData A pointer that is passed to the callback routine with each event. This might be used by the caller to cor<hy>
relate the event to the source of the registration.
pluginOid If this is a valid plugin object ID, then registration is limited to that plugin. If this is zero, then the regis<hy>
tration is for all plugins.
The MP_RegisterForObjectVisibilityChanges() function registers a client function to be called whenever the
property of an object changes. The function specified by pClientFn is called whenever objects appear or disappear.
It is not an error to re-register a client function. However, a client function has only one registration. The first call to
deregister a client function will deregister it no matter how many calls to register the function have been made.
MP_STATUS_INVALID_OBJECT_TYPE
The pluginOid or objectType does not specify any valid object type. This is most likely to happen if an uninitialized
object ID is passed to the API.
MP_STATUS_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND
The pluginOid owner ID or object sequence number is invalid.
MP_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER
The pCallerData is null or if the pluginOid has a type subfield other than MP_OBJECT_TYPE_PLUGIN, or
when objectType is invalid.
MP_STATUS_SUCCESS
The operation is successful.
MP_STATUS_FN_REPLACED
An existing client function is replaced with the one specified in pClientFn.
