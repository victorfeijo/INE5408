wusb_df, hwa1480_fw <-> WUSB firmware download driver and firmware module for Intel i1480 chipset
The wusb_df driver is a Solaris USB Architecture (USBA) compliant client driver that is used to download firmware
for Host Wire Adapter (HWA) dongles that use Intel i1480 chipsets.
Currently, the wusb_df driver can only download driver for Intel i1480 based HWA dongles. The hwa1480_fw is a
miscellaneous module which is transformed from Intel's firmware binary version RC1.3PA2-20070828. wusb_df
reads firmware data from hwa1480_fw module and downloads it to HWA hardware.
Users can use elfwrap(1) to transform new firmware binary. Users must use the same name as hwa1480_fw, since
wusb_df only recognizes this symbol.
