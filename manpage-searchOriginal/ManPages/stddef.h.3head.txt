stddef.h, stddef <-> standard type definitions
#include <stddef.h>
The <stddef.h> header defines the following macros:
NULL
Null pointer constant.
offsetof(type, member-designator)
Integer constant expression of type size_t, the value of which is the offset in bytes to the structure member (mem<hy>
ber-designator), from the beginning of its structure (type).
The <stddef.h> header defines the following types:
ptrdiff_t Signed integer type of the result of subtracting two pointers.
wchar_t Integer type whose range of values can represent distinct wide-character codes for all members of the
largest character set specified among the locales supported by the compilation environment: the null character has
the code value 0 and each member of the portable character set has a code value equal to its value when used as the
lone character in an integer character constant.
size_t Unsigned integer type of the result of the sizeof operator.
The implementation supports one or more programming environments in which the widths of ptrdiff_t, size_t, and
wchar_t are no greater than the width of type long. The names of these programming environments can be obtained
using the confstr(3C) function or the getconf(1) utility.
