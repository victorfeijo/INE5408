int tgetent(char *bp, const char *name);
int tgetflag(char id[2]);
int tgetnum(char id[2]);
char *tgetstr(char id[2], char **area);
char *tgoto(char *cap, int col, int row);
bp Is a pointer to a buffer. This parameter is ignored.
name Is the termcap entry to look up.
cap Is the pointer to a termcap capability.
area Is a pointer to the area where tgetstr() stores the decoded string.
col Is the column placement of the new cursor.
row Is the row placement of the new cursor.
The tgetent() function looks up the termcap entry for name. The emulation ignores the buffer pointer bp.
The tgetflag() function gets the Boolean entry for id.
The tgetnum() function gets the numeric entry for id.
The tgetstr() function gets the string entry for id. If area is not a null pointer and does not point to a null pointer,
tgetstr() copies the string entry into the buffer pointed to by *area and advances the variable pointed to by area to
the first byte after the copy of the string entry.
The tgoto() function instantiates the parameters col and row into the capability cap and returns a pointer to the re<hy>
sulting string.
All of the information available in the terminfo database need not be available through these functions.
Upon successful completion, those functions that return integers return OK. Otherwise, they return ERR.
Those functions that return pointers return a null pointer when an error occurs.
No errors are defined.
These functions are included as a conversion aid for programs that use the termcap library. Their arguments are the
same and the functions are emulated using the terminfo database.
These functions are only guaranteed to operate reliably on character sets in which each character fits into a single
byte, whose attributes can be expressed using only constants with the A_ prefix.
Any terminal capabilities from the terminfo database that cannot be retrieved using these functions can be retrieved
using the functions described on the tigetflag(3XCURSES) manual page.

Portable applications must use tputs(3XCURSES) to output the strings returned by tgetstr() and tgoto().
