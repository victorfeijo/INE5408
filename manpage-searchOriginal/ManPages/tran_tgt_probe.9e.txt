tran_tgt_probe <-> request to probe SCSI bus for a particular target
#include <sys/scsi/scsi.h>
int prefixtran_tgt_probe(struct scsi_device *sd, int (*waitfunc,
 void)););
Solaris architecture specific (Solaris DDI).
sd Pointer to a scsi_device(9S) structure.
waitfunc Pointer to either NULL_FUNC or SLEEP_FUNC.
The tran_tgt_probe() vector in the scsi_hba_tran(9S) structure may be initialized during the HBA driver's at<hy>
tach(9E) to point to a function to be called by scsi_probe(9F) when called by a target driver during probe(9E) and
attach(9E) to probe for a particular SCSI target on the bus. In the absence of an HBA-specific tran_tgt_probe()
function, the default scsi_probe(9F) behavior is supplied by the function scsi_hba_probe(9F).
The possible choices the HBA driver may make are: <bu> Initialize the tran_tgt_probe vector to point to sc<hy>
si_hba_probe(9F), which results in the same behavior. <bu> Initialize the tran_tgt_probe vector to point to a private
function in the HBA, which may call scsi_hba_probe(9F) before or after any necessary processing, as long as all
the defined scsi_probe(9F) semantics are preserved.
waitfunc indicates what tran_tgt_probe() should do when resources are not available:
NULL_FUNC Do not wait for resources. See scsi_probe(9F) for defined return values if no resources are avail<hy>
able.
SLEEP_FUNC Wait indefinitely for resources.
