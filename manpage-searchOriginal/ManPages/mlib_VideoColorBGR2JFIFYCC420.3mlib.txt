The mlib_VideoColorBGR2JFIFYCC420() function performs color space conversion from BGR to YCbCr to<hy>
gether with sampling rate conversion when used in the JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF).
The function takes the following arguments:
y0 Pointer to upper destination Y component row. y0 must be 8-byte aligned.
y1 Pointer to lower destination Y component row. y1 must be 8-byte aligned.
cb Pointer to destination Cb component row. cb must be 8-byte aligned.
cr Pointer to destination Cr component row. cr must be 8-byte aligned.
bgr0 Pointer to upper source BGR multi-component row. bgr0 must be 8-byte aligned.
bgr1 Pointer to lower source BGR multi-component row. bgr1 must be 8-byte aligned.
n Length of Y component row. n must be even. The length of Cb and Cr component rows must be n/2. The length of
the BGR multi-component row must be 3*n.
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
