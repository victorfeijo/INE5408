tnd <-> trusted network daemon
/usr/sbin/tnd [-p poll-interval]
The tnd (trusted network daemon) initializes the kernel with trusted network databases and also reloads the data<hy>
bases on demand from an LDAP server and local files. tnd follows the order specified in the nsswitch.conf file
when loading configuration databases. tnd is started at the beginning of the boot process.
tnd loads two databases into the kernel: the remote host database, tnrhdb and the remote-host template database,
tnrhtp. These databases and their effect on the trusted network are described in their respective man pages. When
the associated LDAP database or local databases are changed, tnd also updates the local kernel cache at the prede<hy>
termined interval.
If a local trusted networking database file is modified, the administrator should run tnchkdb(1M) to check the syn<hy>
tax, and should also run svcadm refresh svc:/network/tnd to initiate an immediate database scan by tnd.
tnd is intended to be started from an smf(5) script and to run in the global zone. The following signals cause specific
svcadm actions:
SIGHUP Causes svcadm refresh svc:/network/tnd to be run.
Initiates a rescan of the local and LDAP tnrhdb and tnrhtp databases. tnd updates the kernel database with any
changes found.
SIGTERM Causes svcadm disable svc:/network/tnd to be run.
Terminates the tnd daemon. No changes are made to the kernel database.
Running tnd in debug mode is determined by the value of the following service management facility (SMF) proper<hy>
ty:
 tnd/debug_level = 0
A value of 0, as above, prevents debug information from being collected; 1 turns on debugging. The default value is
0. Debug output is sent to the /var/tsol/tndlog log file.
-p poll-interval Set poll interval to poll-interval seconds. The default poll-interval is 1800 seconds (30 minutes).
Example 1 Changing the Poll Interval
The following command changes the polling interval to one hour, and puts this interval in the SMF repository. At the
next boot, the tnd poll interval will be one hour.
 # svccfg -s network/tnd setprop tnd/poll_interval=3600
The following command changes the polling interval, but does not update the repository. At the next boot, the tnd
poll interval remains the default, 30 minutes.
 # tnd -p 3600

The functionality described on this manual page is available only if the system is configured with Trusted Exten<hy>
sions.
The tnd service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/network/tnd
The service's status can be queried by using svcs(1). Administrative actions on this service, such as requests to
restart the daemon, can be performed using svcadm(1M), as in:
 svcadm restart svc:/network/tnd
