The bkgdsets() and wbkgdset() routines manipulate the background of the named window. Background is a chtype
consisting of any combination of attributes and a character. The attribute part of the background is combined (ORed)
with all non-blank characters that are written into the window with waddch(). Both the character and attribute parts
of the background are combined with the blank characters. The background becomes a property of the character and
moves with the character through any scrolling and insert/delete line/character operations. To the extent possible on
a particular terminal, the attribute part of the background is displayed as the graphic rendition of the character put on
the screen.
The bkgd() and wbkgd() routines combine the new background with every position in the window. Background is
any combination of attributes and a character. Only the attribute part is used to set the background of non-blank
characters, while both character and attributes are used for blank positions. To the extent possible on a particular ter<hy>
minal, the attribute part of the background is displayed as the graphic rendition of the character put on the screen.
bkgd() and wbkgd() return the integer OK, or a non-negative integer, if immedok() is set. See curs_out<hy>
opts(3CURSES).
See attributes(5) for descriptions of the following attributes:
tab() box; cw(2.75i) |cw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) |lw(2.75i) ATTRIBUTE TYPEATTRIBUTE VALUE _ MT-LevelUnsafe

The header <curses.h> automatically includes the headers <stdio.h> and <unctrl.h>.
Note that bkgdset() and bkgd() may be macros.
