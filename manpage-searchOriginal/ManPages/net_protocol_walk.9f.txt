#include <sys/neti.h>
net_data_t *net_protocol_walk(net_data_t net);
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
net value returned from a successful call to net_protocol_lookup(9F).
The net_protocol_walk() function walks through all of the network protocols that have been registered with this in<hy>
terface. The initial call to net_protocol_walk() should be made by passing in NULL as the value for net. When this
function returns NULL, the end of the list has been reached.
A caller of net_protocol_walk() is required to walk through the entire list of network protocols, until NULL is re<hy>
turned or, when finished with using the value returned, pass it into a call to net_protocol_release(9F).
The net_protocol_walk() function returns NULL when the end of the list is returned. Otherwise, it returns a non-
NULL value as a token for being passed into other function calls within this interface.
The net_protocol_walk() function may be called from user, kernel, or interrupt context.
