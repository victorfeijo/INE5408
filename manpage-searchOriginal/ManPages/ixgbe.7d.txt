ixgbe <-> Intel 10Gb PCI Express NIC Driver
/dev/ixgbe*
The ixgbe 10 Gigabit Ethernet driver is a multi-threaded, loadable, clonable, GLD-based STREAMS driver support<hy>
ing the Data Link Provider Interface, dlpi(7P), on Intel 10-Gigabit PCI Express Ethernet controllers.
The ixgbe driver functions include controller initialization, frame transmit and receive, promiscuous and multicast
support, and error recovery and reporting.
The ixgbe driver and hardware support auto-negotiation, a protocol specified by the IEEE 802.3ae specification.
The cloning character-special device, /dev/ixgbe, is used to access all Intel 10 -Gigabit PCI Express Ethernet devices
installed within the system.
The ixgbe driver is managed by the dladm(1M) command line utility, which allows VLANs to be defined on top of
ixgbe instances and for ixgbe instances to be aggregated. See dladm(1M) for more details.
You must send an explicit DL_ATTACH_REQ message to associate the opened stream with a particular device
(PPA). The PPA ID is interpreted as an unsigned integer data type and indicates the corresponding device instance
(unit) number. The driver returns an error (DL_ERROR_ACK) if the PPA field value does not correspond to a valid
device instance number for the system. The device is initialized on first attach and de-initialized (stopped) at last de<hy>
tach.
The values returned by the driver in the DL_INFO_ACK primitive in response to your DL_INFO_REQ are: <bu> Maxi<hy>
mum SDU is 16366. <bu> Minimum SDU is 0. <bu> DLSAP address length is 8. <bu> MAC type is DL_ETHER. <bu> SAP (Ser<hy>
vice Access Point) length value is -2, meaning the physical address component is followed immediately by a 2-byte
SAP component within the DLSAP address. <bu> Broadcast address value is the Ethernet/IEEE broadcast address
(FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF).
Once in the DL_ATTACHED state, you must send a DL_BIND_REQ to associate a particular SAP with the stream.
By default, the ixgbe driver performs auto-negotiation to select the link speed and mode. Link speed and mode can
only be 10000 Mbps full-duplex. See the IEEE802.3 standard for more information.
