mkbootmedia <-> create bootable Solaris ISO image
/usr/bin/mkbootmedia -v [-l label] media-root iso
The mkbootmedia utility takes media-root (the root of an on-disk Solaris install media) as input and creates a
bootable Solaris ISO image in the file iso, using mkisofs(8). The file can then be burned onto a CD/DVD with utili<hy>
ties such as cdrw(1) or cdrecord(1). (Neither mkisofs(8) nor cdrecord(1) are SunOS man pages.) Caution -
The directory tree media-root must contain the file boot/grub/stage2_eltorito, which will be written to the media
boot sectors. This file will be modified with some boot information, thus it must be writable. If necessary, first save a
copy prior to running this utility.
The following options are supported:
-l label
Sets label as the label/volume name of the ISO image.
-v
Verbose. Multiple -v options increase verbosity.
The following operands are supported:
media-root
Top-level directory of an on-disk Solaris install media.
iso
Name of the output file which will contain the resulting ISO image.
Example 1 Creating an ISO Image and Burning a CD/DVD
The following commands create an ISO image from the content of s10u1 and burn the image to a CD/DVD.
 # /usr/bin/mkbootmedia s10u1 s10u1.iso
 # /usr/bin/cdrw -i s10u1.iso
