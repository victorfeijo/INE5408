mlib_status mlib_ImageCrossCorrel_Fp(mlib_d64 *correl, const mlib_image *img1,
 const mlib_image *img2);
The mlib_ImageCrossCorrel_Fp() function computes the cross-correlation between a pair of floating-point images.
It uses the following equation:
  1 w-1 h-1
 correl[i] = ----- * SUM SUM (img1[x][y][i] * img2[x][y][i])
  w*h x=0 y=0
where w and h are the width and height of the images, respectively.
The function takes the following arguments:
correl Pointer to cross correlation array on a channel basis. The array must be the size of channels in the images.
correl[i] contains the cross-correlation of channel i.
img1 Pointer to first image.
img2 Pointer to second image.
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
