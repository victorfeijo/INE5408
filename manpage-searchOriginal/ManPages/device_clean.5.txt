device_clean <-> device clean programs
Each allocatable device has a device clean program associated with it. Device clean programs are invoked by deallo<hy>
cate(1) to clean device states, registers, and any residual information in the device before the device is allocated to a
user. Such cleaning is required by the object reuse policy.
Use list_devices(1) to obtain the names and types of allocatable devices as well as the cleaning program and the au<hy>
thorizations that are associated with each device.
On a system configured with Trusted Extensions, device clean programs are also invoked by allocate(1), in which
case the program can optionally mount appropriate media for the caller.
The following device clean programs reside in /etc/security/lib.
audio_clean audio devices
fd_clean floppy devices
st_clean tape devices
sr_clean CD-ROM devices
On a system configured with Trusted Extensions, the following additional cleaning programs and wrappers are avail<hy>
able.
disk_clean floppy, CD-ROM, and other removable media devices. This program mounts the device during the ex<hy>
ecution of allocate, if required.
audio_clean_wrapper wrapper to make audio_clean work with CDE
wdwwrapper wrapper to make other cleaning programs work with CDE
wdwmsg CDE dialog boxes for cleaning programs
Administrators can create device clean programs for their sites. These programs must adhere to the syntax described
below.
 /etc/security/lib/device-clean-program [<mi>i | <mi>f | <mi>s | <mi>I] \
 <mi>m mode <mi>u user-name <mi>z zone-name <mi>p zone-path device-name
where:
device-name The name of the device that is to be cleaned. Use list_devices to obtain the list of allocatable devices.
-i Invoke boot-time initialization.
-f Force cleanup by the administrator.
-s Invoke standard cleanup by the user.
-I Same as -i, with no error or warning.

The following options are supported only when the system is configured with Trusted Extensions.
-m mode Specify the mode in which the clean program is invoked. Valid values are allo- cate and deallocate. The de<hy>
fault mode is allocate.
-u user-name Specify the name of user who executes the device clean program. The default user is the caller.
-z zone-name Specify the name of the zone in which the device is to be allocated or deallocated. The default zone is
the global zone.
-p zone-path Establish the root path of the zone that is specified by zone-name. Default is "/".
The following exit values are returned:
0
Successful completion.
1
An error. Caller can place device in error state.
2
A system error. Caller can place device in error state.
On a system configured with Trusted Extensions, the following additional exit values are returned:
3
Mounting of device failed. Caller shall not place device in error state.
4
Mounting of device succeeded.
