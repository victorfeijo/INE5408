scsi_setup_cdb <-> setup SCSI command descriptor block (CDB)
int scsi_setup_cdb(union scsi_cdb *cdbp, uchar_t cmd, uint_t addr,
 uint_t cnt, uint_t othr_cdb_data);
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
cdbp Pointer to command descriptor block.
cmd The first byte of the SCSI group 0, 1, 2, 4, or 5 CDB.
addr Pointer to the location of the data.
cnt Data transfer length in units defined by the SCSI device type. For sequential devices cnt is the number of bytes.
For block devices, cnt is the number of blocks.
othr_cdb_data Additional CDB data.
The scsi_setup_cdb() function initializes a group 0, 1, 2, 4, or 5 type of command descriptor block pointed to by
cdbp using cmd, addr, cnt, othr_cdb_data.
addr should be set to 0 for commands having no addressing information (for example, group 0 READ command for
sequential access devices). othr_cdb_data should be additional CDB data for Group 4 commands; otherwise, it
should be set to 0.
The scsi_setup_cdb() function does not set the LUN bits in CDB[1] as the makecom(9F) functions do. Also, the
fixed bit for sequential access device commands is not set.
The scsi_setup_cdb() function returns:
1 Upon success.
0 Upon failure.
These functions can be called from a user, interrupt, or kernel context.
