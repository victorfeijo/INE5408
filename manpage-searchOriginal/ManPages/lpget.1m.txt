lpget <-> get printing configuration
lpget [-k key] [destination... | list]
The lpget utility reads printing configuration information from the configuration databases in $HOME/.printers,
/etc/printers.conf, printers.conf.byname, and printers.org_dir printer. This information, called a configuration re<hy>
port, is displayed to the standard output. See printers(4) and printers.conf(4) for information about the printer con<hy>
figuration databases.
lpget displays a configuration report for all keys for the specified destination or destinations by default. Use the -k
option to display a configuration report for specific keys. Use the list operand to display a configuration report for
all configured destinations.
The following option is supported:
-k key Displays a configuration report for key. See printers.conf(4) for information about specifying key.
The following operands are supported:
destination Displays a configuration report for destination. Destination can be either a printer of a class of printers.
See lpadmin(1M). Specify destination using atomic or POSIX-style (server:destination) names. See printers.conf
(4) for information regarding the naming conventions for atomic names and standards(5) for information concern<hy>
ing POSIX.
list Displays a configuration report for all configured destinations.
Example 1 Displaying a Configuration Report for the bsdaddr Key
The following example displays a configuration report for the bsdaddr key for printer catalpa.
 example% lpget -k bsdaddr catalpa
Example 2 A Configuration Report for all Keys for all Configured Destinations

Be mindful of the following if the LDAP database is used as the name service. If the ldapclient(1M) server is a
replica LDAP server, LDAP printer database updates may not appear immediately, as the replica server may not not
have been updated by the master server and can be out of sync. For example, a printer that you deleted by using
lpset(1M) may still appear in the printer list you display with lpget until the replica is updated from the master.
Replica servers vary as to how often they are updated from the master. Refer to the for more information on LDAP
replication.
