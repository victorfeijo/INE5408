tic <-> terminfo compiler
tic [-v [n]] [-c] file
The command tic translates a terminfo file from the source format into the compiled format. The results are placed
in the directory /usr/share/lib/terminfo. The compiled format is necessary for use with the library routines in curs<hy>
es(3CURSES).
If the environment variable TERMINFO is set, the compiled results are placed there instead of /usr/share/lib/ter<hy>
minfo.
Total compiled entries cannot exceed 4096 bytes. The name field cannot exceed 128 bytes. Terminal names exceed<hy>
ing 14 characters will be truncated to 14 characters and a warning message will be printed.
The following options are supported:
-c Specifies to check only file for errors. Errors in use= links are not detected.
-v[n] Specify that (verbose) output be written to standard error trace information showing tic's progress. The option<hy>
al integer n is a number from 1 to 10, indicating the desired level of detail of information. If n is omitted, the default
level is 1. If n is specified and greater than 1, the level of detail is increased.
file Contains one or more terminfo terminal descriptions in source format [see terminfo(4)]. Each description in the
file describes the capabilities of a particular terminal. When a use=entry-name field is discovered in a terminal entry
currently being compiled, tic reads in the binary from /usr/share/lib/terminfo to complete the entry. (Entries creat<hy>
ed from file will be used first. If the environment variable TERMINFO is set, that directory is searched instead of
/usr/share/lib/terminfo.) tic duplicates the capabilities in entry-name for the current entry, with the exception of
those capabilities that are explicitly defined in the current entry.

try_name_2 must also appear in entry_name_1 before use= for these capabilities to be canceled in entry_name_1.
