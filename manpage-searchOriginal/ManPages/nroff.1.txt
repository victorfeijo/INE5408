nroff <-> format documents for display or line-printer
nroff [-ehiq] [-mname] [-nN] [-opagelist] [-raN] [-sN]
 [-Tname] [-uN] [filename...]
The nroff utility formats text in the named filename for typewriter-like devices. See also troff(1).
If no filename argument is present, nroff reads the standard input. An argument consisting of a `<mi>' is taken to be a
file name corresponding to the standard input.
The following options are supported. Options can appear in any order so long as they appear before the files.
-e Produces equally-spaced words in adjusted lines, using full terminal resolution.
-h Uses output TAB characters during horizontal spacing to speed output and reduces output character count. TAB
settings are assumed to be every 8 nominal character widths.
-i Reads the standard input after the input files are exhausted.
-q Does not print output that was read from an .rd request.
-mname Prepends the macro file /usr/share/lib/tmac/name to the input files.
-nN Numbers first generated page N.
-opagelist Prints only pages whose page numbers appear in the comma-separated list of numbers and ranges. A
range N-M means pages N through M; an initial -N means from the beginning to page N; and a final N<mi> means from
N to the end.
-raN Sets register a (one-character) to N.
-sN Stops every N pages. nroff halts prior to every N pages (default N=1) to allow paper loading or changing, and re<hy>
sumes upon receipt of a NEWLINE.
-Tname Prepares output for a device of the specified name. Known names are:
37 Teletype Corporation Model 37 terminal <em> this is the default.
lp | tn300 GE <em> any line printer or terminal without half-line capability.
300 DASI-300.
300-12 DASI-300 <em> 12-pitch.
300S DASI-300S.
300S-12 DASI-300S.
382 DASI-382 (fancy DTC 382).
<beginning of page>
450 DASI-450 (Diablo Hyterm).
450-12 DASI-450 (Diablo Hyterm) <em> 12-pitch.
832 AJ 832.
-uN Set the emboldening factor for the font mounted in position 3 to N. If N is missing, then set the emboldening
factor to 0.
The following operand is supported:
filename The file containing text to be processed by nroff.
Example 1 Formatting with a macro package
The following command formats users.guide using the -me macro package, and stopping every 4 pages:
 example% nroff <mi>s4 <mi>me users.guide

/usr/tmp is currently a symbolic link to /var/tmp.
Previous documentation incorrectly described the numeric register yr as being the Last two digits of current year.
yr is in actuality the number of years since 1900. To correctly obtain the last two digits of the current year through
the year 2099, the definition given below of string register yy can be included in a document and subsequently used
to display a two-digit year. Notice that any other available one- or two-character register name can be substituted for
yy.
<beginning of page>
 .\" definition of new string register yy--last two digits of year
 .\" use yr (# of years since 1900) if it is < 100
 .ie \n(yr<100 .ds yy \n(yr
 .el \{ .\" else, subtract 100 from yr, store in ny
 .nr ny \n(yr-100
 .ie \n(ny>9 \{ .\" use ny if it is two digits
 .ds yy \n(ny
 .\" remove temporary number register ny
 .rr ny \}
 .el \{.ds yy 0
 .\" if ny is one digit, append it to 0
 .as yy \n(ny
 .rr ny \} \}
