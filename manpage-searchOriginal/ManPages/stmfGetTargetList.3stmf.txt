int stmfGetTargetList(stmfDevidList **targetList);
targetList A pointer to a pointer to an stmfDevidList structure. On successful return, this will contain a list of target
ports in the system.
The stmfGetTargetList() function retrieves the list of target ports. The caller should call stmfFreeMemo<hy>
ry(3STMF) when this list is no longer needed.
The following values are returned:
STMF_ERROR_NOMEM The library was unable to allocate sufficient memory for targetList.
STMF_STATUS_SUCCESS The API call was successful.
