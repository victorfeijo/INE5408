powerd <-> power manager daemon
/usr/lib/power/powerd [-n]
The powerd daemon is started by pmconfig(1M) to monitor system activity and perform an automatic shutdown us<hy>
ing the suspend-resume feature. When the system is suspended, complete current state is saved on the disk before
power is removed. On reboot, the system automatically starts a resume operation and the system is restored to the
same state it was in immediately prior to suspend.
Immediately prior to system shutdown, the daemon notifies syslogd(1M) of the shutdown, which broadcasts a notifi<hy>
cation.
The following option is supported:
-n No broadcast mode. The daemon silently shuts down the system without notifying syslogd(1M).
