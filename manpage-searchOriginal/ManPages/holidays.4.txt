holidays <-> prime/nonprime table for the accounting system
/etc/acct/holidays
The /etc/acct/holidays file specifies prime time hours and holidays. Holidays and weekends are considered non-
prime time hours.
/etc/acct/holidays is used by the accounting system.
All lines beginning with an * are comments.
The /etc/acct/holidays file consists of two sections. The first non-comment line defines the current year and the start
time of prime and non-prime time hours, in the form of:
 current_year prime_start non_prime_start
Specify prime_start and non_prime_start times in the range of 0000 to 2400.
The remaining non-comment lines define the holidays in the form of:
 month/day company_holiday
Of these two fields, only the month/day is actually used by the accounting system programs.
The /etc/acct/holidays file must be updated every year. Example 1 An Example of the /etc/acct/holidays File
