ecvt, fcvt, gcvt <-> convert floating-point number to string
#include <stdlib.h>
char *ecvt(double value, int ndigit, int *restrict decpt, int *restrict sign);
char *fcvt(double value, int ndigit, int *restrict decpt, int *restrict sign);
char *gcvt(double value, int ndigit, char *buf);
The ecvt(), fcvt() and gcvt() functions convert floating-point numbers to null-terminated strings.
The ecvt() function converts value to a null-terminated string of ndigit digits (where ndigit is reduced to an unspeci<hy>
fied limit determined by the precision of a double) and returns a pointer to the string. The high-order digit is non-
zero, unless the value is 0. The low-order digit is rounded. The position of the radix character relative to the begin<hy>
ning of the string is stored in the integer pointed to by decpt (negative means to the left of the returned digits). The
radix character is not included in the returned string. If the sign of the result is negative, the integer pointed to by
sign is non-zero, otherwise it is 0.
If the converted value is out of range or is not representable, the contents of the returned string are unspecified.
The fcvt() function is identical to ecvt() except that ndigit specifies the number of digits desired after the radix point.
The total number of digits in the result string is restricted to an unspecified limit as determined by the precision of a
double.
The gcvt() function converts value to a null-terminated string (similar to that of the %g format of printf(3C)) in the
array pointed to by buf and returns buf. It produces ndigit significant digits (limited to an unspecified value deter<hy>
mined by the precision of a double) in %f if possible, or %e (scientific notation) otherwise. A minus sign is includ<hy>
ed in the returned string if value is less than 0. A radix character is included in the returned string if value is not a
whole number. Trailing zeros are suppressed where value is not a whole number. The radix character is determined
by the current locale. If setlocale(3C) has not been called successfully, the default locale, POSIX, is used. The de<hy>
fault locale specifies a period (.) as the radix character. The LC_NUMERIC category determines the value of the
radix character within the current locale.
The ecvt() and fcvt() functions return a pointer to a null-terminated string of digits.
The gcvt() function returns buf.
No errors are defined.
The return values from ecvt() and fcvt() might point to thread-specific data that can be overwritten by subsequent
calls to these functions by the same thread.
For portability to implementations conforming to earlier versions of Solaris, sprintf(3C) is preferred over this func<hy>
tion.
