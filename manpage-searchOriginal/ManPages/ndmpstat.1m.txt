ndmpstat <-> show NDMP backup progress statistics
ndmpstat [tapes] [interval [count]]
The ndmpstat utility reports Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) statistics, among which are NDMP
worker threads, disk IO, tape IO, files operation, performance, and backup activity.
ndmpstat reports the aggregate statistics for all tapes and disks. In order to obtain statistics for specific tape devices,
the tape device name should be passed as argument to the utility.
When invoked, ndmpstat begins its display with a one-line summary of the NDMP daemon activity since the
NDMP service was invoked.
The fields in ndmpstat output are described as follows:
wthr
Report the number of worker threads in each of the four following states:
r
the number of worker threads running
w
the number of blocked worker threads that are waiting for resources such as I/O and paging
b
the number of backup operations currently running
r
the number of restore operations currently running
file
Report on usage of filesystem.
rd
the number of files being read
wr
the number of files being written
disk
Report the number of disk operations per interval.
rd
the number of disk blocks being read
wr
the number of disk blocks being written
<beginning of page>
tape
Report the number of tape operations per interval. There are slots for up to four tapes, labeled with a single number.
The number indicates the name of the device under /dev/rmt.
rd
the number of tape blocks being read
wr
the number of tape blocks being written
bytes
Report the number of bytes transferred. This is the aggregate value of both tape and disk devices. The number is in
kilobytes.
rd
the number of kilobytes being read
wr
the number of kilobytes being written
perf
Displays a rough estimate of performance of the backup/restore operation in megabytes per second.
bk
backup performance
rs
restore performance
prcnt
Display the comparative usage of resources, in percent.
dsk
disk I/O time
tpe
tape I/O time
otr
other time (memory or idle)
See EXAMPLES.
The following operands are supported:
<beginning of page>
count Specifies the number of times that the statistics display is repeated.
tape Specifies which tapes are to be given priority in the output. A command line is limited to a maximum of four
tape devices. A common tape name is /dev/rmt/n, where n is an integer.
interval Specifies the number of seconds over which ndmpstat summarizes activity. The specified interval remains
in effect till the command is terminated.
Example 1 Using ndmpstat
The following command displays a summary of NDMP daemon activity at five-second intervals.
