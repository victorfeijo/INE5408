in.tftpd, tftpd <-> Internet Trivial File Transfer Protocol server
in.tftpd [-d] [-T rexmtval] [-s] [homedir]
tftpd is a server that supports the Internet Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP).
Before responding to a request, the server attempts to change its current directory to homedir; the default directory is
/tftpboot.
The use of tftp does not require an account or password on the remote system. Due to the lack of authentication in<hy>
formation, in.tftpd will allow only publicly readable files to be accessed. Files may be written only if they already
exist and are publicly writable. Note that this extends the concept of "public" to include all users on all hosts that can
be reached through the network. This may not be appropriate on all systems, and its implications should be consid<hy>
ered before enabling this service.
in.tftpd runs with the user ID and group ID set to [GU]ID_NOBODY under the assumption that no files exist with
that owner or group. However, nothing checks this assumption or enforces this restriction.
-d Debug. When specified it sets the SO_DEBUG socket option.
-s Secure. When specified, the directory change to homedir must succeed. The daemon also changes its root directo<hy>
ry to homedir.
-T rexmtval Specifies the value of the retransmission timeout in seconds. This also affects the maximum session
timeout in that the latter is set to five times the retransmission timeout value.
The in.tftpd server is IPv6-enabled. See ip6(7P).
in.tftpd supports transfers of greater than 32 MB, per RFC 2348.

The tftpd server only acknowledges the transfer size option that is sent with a read request when the octet transfer
mode is specified.
The in.tftpd.1m service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/network/tftp/udp6:default
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). Responsibility for initiating and restarting this service is delegated to inetd(1M). Use inetadm(1M) to
make configuration changes and to view configuration information for this service. The service's status can be
queried using the svcs(1) command.

Unlike most smf(5) services, a manifest for the tftp service is not included in the system. To create one and enable
this service, the administrator should: 1. Edit /etc/inet/inetd.conf and uncomment the tftp entry. 2. Run
/usr/sbin/inetconv.
After you run inetconv, the svc:/network/tftp/udp6:default service is created and enabled.
