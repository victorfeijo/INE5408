rmmount <-> removable media mounter for CD-ROM, floppy, Jaz drive, and others
/usr/sbin/rmmount [-D]
The rmmount utility is a removable media mounter that is executed by volume management whenever a removable
medium, such as a CD-ROM or a floppy, is inserted. Removable media is managed by an application or a volume
manager. rmmount can also be called by using volrmmount(1).
Upon insertion of a medium and following invocation of the volcheck(1) command, rmmount determines what type
of file system (if any) is on that medium. If a file system is present, rmmount mounts the file system in one of the
locations listed below.
For a diskette (floppy):
/floppy/floppy0 symbolic link to mounted floppy in local floppy drive
/floppy/floppy_name mounted named floppy
/floppy/unnamed_floppy mounted unnamed floppy
For a CD-ROM or a DVD-ROM:
/cdrom/cdrom0
symbolic link to mounted CD-ROM in local CD-ROM drive
/cdrom/CD-ROM_name
mounted named CD-ROM
/cdrom/CD-ROM_name/partition
mounted named CD-ROM with partitioned file system
/cdrom/unnamed_cdrom
mounted unnamed CD-ROM
For a Zip drive:
/rmdisk/zip0 symbolic link to mounted Zip medium in local Zip drive
/rmdisk/Zip_name mounted named Zip medium
/rmdisk/Zip_name/partition mounted named Zip medium with partitioned file system
/rmdisk/unnamed_zip mounted unnamed Zip medium
For a Jaz drive:
/rmdisk/jaz0 symbolic link to mounted Jaz medium in local Jaz drive
/rmdisk/Jaz_name mounted named Jaz medium
<beginning of page>
/rmdisk/Jaz_name/partition mounted named Jaz medium with partitioned file system
/rmdisk/unnamed_Jaz mounted unnamed Jaz medium
For a generic "rmdisk" drive:
/rmdisk/rmdisk0
symbolic link to mounted removable medium in local removable medium drive
/rmdisk/rmdisk_name
mounted named removable medium
/rmdisk/rmdisk_name/partition
mounted named removable medium with partitioned file system
/rmdisk/unnamed_rmdisk
mounted unnamed removable medium
If the media is read-only (for example, a CD-ROM or a floppy with write-protect tab set), the file system is mounted
read-only.
If a file system is not identified, rmmount does not mount a file system. See the for more information on the loca<hy>
tion of CD-ROM, floppy, and other media without file systems.
If a file system type has been determined, it is then checked to see that it is "clean." If the file system is "dirty," fsck
-p (see fsck(1M)) is run in an attempt to clean it. If fsck fails, the file system is mounted read-only.
After the mount is complete, "actions" associated with the media type are executed. These actions allow for the noti<hy>
fication to other programs that new media are available.
Actions are executed in the order in which they appear in the configuration file. The action function can return either
1 or 0. If it returns 0, no further actions will be executed. This allows the function to control which applications are
executed.
In order to execute an action, rmmount performs a dlopen(3C) on the shared object and calls the action function de<hy>
fined within it. The definition of the interface to actions can be found in /usr/include/rmmount.h.
File systems mounted by rmmount are always mounted with the nosuid flag set, thereby disabling setuid programs
and access to block or character devices in that file system. Upon ejection, rmmount unmounts mounted file sys<hy>
tems and executes actions associated with the media type. If a file system is "busy" (that is, it contains the current
working directory of a live process), the ejection will fail.
