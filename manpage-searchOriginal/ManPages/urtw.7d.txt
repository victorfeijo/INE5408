urtw <-> RealTek RTL8187L/RTL8187B USB 802.11b/g Wireless Driver
The urtw 802.11b/g wireless driver is a multi-threaded, loadable, clonable, GLDv3-basedSTREAMS driver support<hy>
ing the RealTek RTL8187L chipset-based wireless devices.
The urtw driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rate and mode. Supported 802.11b data rates are 1,
2, 5.5 and 11 Mbits/sec. Supported 802.11g data rates are 1, 2, 5.5, 11, 6, 9, 12, 8, 24, 36, 48 and 54 Mbits/sec. The
atu driver supports only BSS networks (also known asap or infrastructure networks) and open (or open-system)
or shared system authentication.
