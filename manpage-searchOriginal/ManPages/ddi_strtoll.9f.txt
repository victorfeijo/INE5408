The ddi_strtoll() function converts the initial portion of the string pointed to by str to a type longlong_t representa<hy>
tion and stores the converted value in result.
The ddi_strtoull() function converts the initial portion of the string pointed to by str to a type u_longlong_t repre<hy>
sentation and stores the converted value in result.
These functions first decomposes the input string into three parts: 1. An initial (possibly empty) sequence of white-
space characters (" ", "\t", "\n", "\r", "\f") 2. A subject sequence interpreted as an integer represented in some radix
determined by the value of base 3. A final string of one or more unrecognized characters, including the terminating
null byte of the input string.
The ddi_strtoll() function then attempts to convert the subject sequence to an integer and returns the result. The
ddi_strtoull() function attempts to convert the subject sequence to an unsigned integer and returns the result.
If the value of base is 0, the expected form of the subject sequence is that of a decimal constant, octal constant or
hexadecimal constant, any of which may be preceded by a plus ("+") or minus ("-") sign. A decimal constant begins
with a non-zero digit, and consists of a sequence of decimal digits. An octal constant consists of the prefix 0 option<hy>
ally followed by a sequence of the digits 0 to 7 only. A hexadecimal constant consists of the prefix 0x or 0X fol<hy>
lowed by a sequence of the decimal digits and letters a (or A) to f (or F) with values 10 to 15 respectively.
If the value of base is between 2 and 36, the expected form of the subject sequence is a sequence of letters and digits
representing an integer with the radix specified by base, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign. The letters
from a (or A) to z (or Z) inclusive are ascribed the values 10 to 35 and only letters whose ascribed values are less
than that of base are permitted. If the value of base is 16, the characters 0x or 0X may optionally precede the se<hy>
quence of letters and digits, following the sign if present.
The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial subsequence of the input string, starting with the first non-
white-space character that is of the expected form. The subject sequence contains no characters if the input string is
empty or consists entirely of white-space characters, or if the first non-white-space character is other than a sign or a
permissible letter or digit.
If the subject sequence has the expected form and the value of base is 0, the sequence of characters starting with the
first digit is interpreted as an integer constant. If the subject sequence has the expected form and the value of base is
between 2 and 36, it is used as the base for conversion, ascribing to each letter its value as given above. If the subject
sequence begins with a minus sign, the value resulting from the conversion is negated. A pointer to the final string is
stored in the object pointed to by endptr, provided that endptr is not a null pointer.
If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the expected form, no conversion is performed and the value of str
is stored in the object pointed to by endptr, provided that endptr is not a null pointer.
Upon successful completion, these functions return 0 and store the converted value in result. If no conversion is per<hy>

formed due to an invalid base, these functions return EINVAL and the variable pointed by result is not changed.
These functions may be called from user, kernel or interrupt context.
