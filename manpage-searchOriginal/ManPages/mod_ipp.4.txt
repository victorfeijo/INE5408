mod_ipp <-> Embedded Internet Print Protocol (IPP) listener for the Apache HTTP server
/usr/apache/libexec/mod_ipp.so
The mod_ipp module implements RFCs 2910 and 2911 to provide an IPP handling service for the Apache HTTP
server. When loaded on the Apache server, mod_ipp processes all HTTP requests with MIME types of applica<hy>
tion/ipp. The mod_ipp module also processes additional configuration directives to enable or disable portions of the
protocol support.
The following is a list of configuration directives that apply to the Apache IPP Listening service: <bu> ipp-conformance
(automatic|1.0|1.1) <bu> ipp-operation (operation) (enable|disable) <bu> enable|disable
The values true, yes, on, enable are considered to be synonymous and will enable support for the named operation.
All other values will disable support for the named operation.
The following is a list of IPP handling service operations:
print-job This operation is a required IPP operation that allows client systems to submit a print job with a single
document embedded in the data stream. This operation is primarily used from the IPP support Microsoft has provid<hy>
ed for its Windows (9X/ME/NT/2K/XP).
print-uri This is an optional IPP operation that allows client systems to submit a print job with a reference (URL)
for a single document. This operation is currently not supported by the mod_ipp Apache Module.
validate-job This is a required IPP operation that allows client systems to simulate the submission of a print job to
verify that the server is capable of handling the job. This operation is supported by mod_ipp.
create-job This is an optional IPP operation that allows client systems to submit a print job. The operation is used
with the send-document and send-uri operations.
get-jobs This is a required IPP operation that allows client systems to retrieve a list of print jobs from the print ser<hy>
vice.
get-printer-attributes This is a required IPP operation that allows client systems to retrieve attributes from the print
service that describes the named printer object.
pause-printer This an optional IPP operation that allows client systems to stop job processing on the named print
queue.
resume-printer This is an optional IPP operation that allows client systems to resume job processing on the named
print queue.
purge-jobs This is an optional IPP operation that allows client systems to cancel all print jobs on the named print
queue.
send-document This is a required IPP operation that allows client systems to add documents to print jobs created
with the create-job operation, but not yet submitted.
send-uri This is an optional IPP operation that allows a client system to add a document reference (URI) to a print
job created with the create-job operation, but not yet submitted. This operation is currently not supported by the
mod_ipp Apache Module.
cancel-job This is a required IPP operation that allows client systems to cancel print jobs.
<beginning of page>
get-job-attributes This is a required IPP operation that allows client systems to retrieve attributes that describe a
print job from the print service.
hold-job This is an optional IPP operation that allows client systems to hold print jobs.
release-job This is an optional IPP operation that allows client systems to release print jobs.
restart-job This is an optional IPP operation that allows client systems to restart print jobs.
all This is a place holder for enabling or disabling support for all IPP operations implemented by the mod_ipp
Apache module.
required This is a place holder for enabling or disabling support for the required IPP operations implemented by the
mod_ipp Apache module.
Example 1 Using a Configuration File to Start a Standalone Apache Server
The following configuration file can be used to start a standalone Apache server to respond to IPP request sent to
port 631.
 ServerType standalone
 ServerRoot "/usr/apache"
 PidFile /var/run/httpd-standalone-ipp.pid
 ErrorLog /var/lp/logs/ipp-errors
 Timeout 300
 KeepAlive On
 MaxKeepAliveRequests 100
 KeepAliveTimeout 15

 LoadModule ipp_module libexec/mod_ipp.so

 <IFModule mod_app>

A more restrictive configuration might include the following parameters:

Configuration file directives are processed in the order listed in the config file. The default behavior is to enable sup<hy>
port for all operations implemented in the mod_ipp Apache module.
Since the Apache IPP listening service implements some capabilities that are more of operator features, it may not
be desirable to enable all IPP operations without requiring user authentication on the Apache listening service.
The following is an example of a more reasonable configuration for Apache IPP servers without user authentication
enabled:
 ipp-operations all disabled
 ipp-operations required enabled
The printers and jobs available under this service can be accessed using URIs of the following form:
 printer:
  http://server[:port]/printers/{queue}
  ipp://server[:port]/printers/{queue}
 job:
  http://server[:port]/printers/{queue}/{job-id}
  ipp://server[:port]/printers/{queue}/{job-id}
631 is the default IPP port and implied when the URI scheme is ipp. However, some client implementations do not
recognize the ipp URI scheme and require http://server:631/... instead. For example, Microsoft's IPP client imple<hy>
mentation does not recognize the ipp scheme.
In addition to the documentation and man pages included with Solaris, more information is available at
http://www.apache.org
The httpd(8) man page and other Apache man pages are provided with the programming modules. To view the
Apache manual pages with the man command, add /usr/apache/man to the MANPATH environment variable. See
man(1) for more information. Running catman(1M) on the Apache manual pages is not supported.
