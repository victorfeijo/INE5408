lpq <-> display the content of a print queue
/usr/ucb/lpq [-P destination] [-l] [+ [interval]]
 [request-ID...] [user]...
The lpq utility displays the information about the contents of a print queue. A print queue is comprised of print re<hy>
quests that are waiting in the process of being printed.
lpq displays the following information to the standard output: <bu> the username of the person associated with a print
request, <bu> the position of a print request in the print queue, <bu> the name of file or files comprising a print request, <bu> the
job number of a print request, and <bu> the size of the file requested by a print request. File size is reported in bytes.
Normally, only as much information as will fit on one line is displayed. If the name of the input file associated with a
print request is not available, the input file field indicates the standard input.
The print client commands locate destination information using the printers database in the name service switch.
See nsswitch.conf(4), printers(4), and printers.conf(4) for details.
The following options are supported:
-l Displays information in long format. Long format includes the name of the host from which a print request origi<hy>
nated in the display.
-P destination Displays information about printer or class of printers (see lpadmin(1M)) . Specify destination using
atomic, URI-style (scheme://endpoint), or POSIX-style (server:destination) names. See printers.conf(4) for infor<hy>
mation regarding destination names.
+ [interval] Displays information at specific time intervals. Stops displaying information when the print queue is
empty. Clears the screen before reporting displaying the print queue. Specify interval as the number of seconds be<hy>
tween displays. If interval is not specified only executes once.
The following operands are supported:
request-ID The job number associated with a print request.
user The name of the user about whose jobs lpq reports information. Specify user as a valid username.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
non-zero An error occurred.
