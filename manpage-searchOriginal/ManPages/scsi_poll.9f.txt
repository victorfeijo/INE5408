scsi_poll <-> run a polled SCSI command on behalf of a target driver
#include <sys/scsi/scsi.h>
int scsi_poll(struct scsi_pkt *pkt);
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
pkt Pointer to the scsi_pkt(9S) structure.
The scsi_poll() function requests the host adapter driver to run a polled command. Unlike scsi_transport(9F) which
runs commands asynchronously, scsi_poll() runs commands to completion before returning. If the pkt_time mem<hy>
ber of pkt is 0, the value of pkt_time is defaulted to SCSI_POLL_TIMEOUT to prevent an indefinite hang of the
system.
The scsi_poll() function returns:
0 command completed successfully.
-1 command failed.
The scsi_poll() function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context. This function should not be called
when the caller is executing timeout(9F) in the context of a thread.

Writing Device Drivers
Since scsi_poll() runs commands to completion before returning, it may require more time than is desirable when
called from interrupt context. Therefore, calling scsi_poll from interrupt context is not recommended.
