Each of the functions returns the energy of the input signal.
In linear predictive coding (LPC) model, each speech sample is represented as a linear combination of the past M
samples.
   M
  s(n) = SUM a(i) * s(n-i) + G * u(n)
   i=1
where s(*) is the speech signal, u(*) is the excitation signal, and G is the gain constants, M is the order of the linear
prediction filter. Given s(*), the goal is to find a set of coefficient a(*) that minimizes the prediction error e(*).
   M
  e(n) = s(n) - SUM a(i) * s(n-i)
   i=1
In autocorrelation method, the coefficients can be obtained by solving following set of linear equations.
   M
  SUM a(i) * r(|i-k|) = r(k), k=1,...,M
  i=1
where
   N-k-1
  r(k) = SUM s(j) * s(j+k)
   j=0
are the autocorrelation coefficients of s(*), N is the length of the input speech vector. r(0) is the energy of the speech
signal.
Note that the autocorrelation matrix R is a Toeplitz matrix (symmetric with all diagonal elements equal), and the
equations can be solved efficiently with Levinson-Durbin algorithm.
See Fundamentals of Speech Recognition by Lawrence Rabiner and Biing-Hwang Juang, Prentice Hall, 1993.
Note for functions with adaptive scaling (with _Adp postfix), the scaling factor of the output data will be calculated
based on the actual data; for functions with non-adaptive scaling (without _Adp postfix), the user supplied scaling
factor will be used and the output will be saturated if necessary.
Each function takes the following arguments:
energy The energy of the input signal.
escale The scaling factor of the energy, where actual_data = output_data * 2**(-scaling_factor).
state Pointer to the internal state structure.

Each function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
