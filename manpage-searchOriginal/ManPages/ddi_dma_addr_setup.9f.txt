int ddi_dma_addr_setup(dev_info_t *dip, struct as *as, caddr_t addr,
 size_t len, uint_t flags, int (*waitfp) (caddr_t), caddr_t arg,
 ddi_dma_lim_t * lim, ddi_dma_handle_t *handlep);
This interface is obsolete. ddi_dma_addr_bind_handle(9F) should be used instead.
dip A pointer to the device's dev_info structure.
as A pointer to an address space structure. Should be set to NULL, which implies kernel address space.
addr Virtual address of the memory object.
len Length of the memory object in bytes.
flags Flags that would go into the ddi_dma_req structure (see ddi_dma_req(9S)).
waitfp The address of a function to call back later if resources aren't available now. The special function addresses
DDI_DMA_SLEEP and DDI_DMA_DONTWAIT (see ddi_dma_req(9S)) are taken to mean, respectively, wait
until resources are available or, do not wait at all and do not schedule a callback.
arg Argument to be passed to a callback function, if such a function is specified.
lim A pointer to a DMA limits structure for this device (see ddi_dma_lim_sparc(9S) or ddi_dma_lim_x86(9S)). If
this pointer is NULL, a default set of DMA limits is assumed.
handlep Pointer to a DMA handle. See ddi_dma_setup(9F) for a discussion of handle.
The ddi_dma_addr_setup() function is an interface to ddi_dma_setup(9F). It uses its arguments to construct an
appropriate ddi_dma_req structure and calls ddi_dma_setup(9F) with it.
See ddi_dma_setup(9F) for the possible return values for this function.
The ddi_dma_addr_setup() can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context, except when waitfp is set to
DDI_DMA_SLEEP, in which case it cannot be called from interrupt context.
