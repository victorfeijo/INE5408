q Pointer to the write queue whose read queue is to be returned.
The RD() function accepts a write queue pointer as an argument and returns a pointer to the read queue of the same
module.
CAUTION: Make sure the argument to this function is a pointer to a write queue. RD() will not check for queue
type, and a system panic could result if it is not the right type.
