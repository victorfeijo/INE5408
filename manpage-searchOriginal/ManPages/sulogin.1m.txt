sulogin <-> access single-user mode
sulogin
The sulogin utility is automatically invoked by init when the system is first started. It prompts the user to type a user
name and password to enter system maintenance mode (single-user mode) or to type EOF (typically CTRL-D) for
normal startup (multi-user mode). The user should never directly invoke sulogin. The user must have the solaris.sys<hy>
tem.maintenance authorization.
The sulogin utility can prompt the user to enter the root password on a variable number of serial console devices, in
addition to the traditional console device. See consadm(1M) and msglog(7D) for a description of how to configure a
serial device to display the single-user login prompt.
/etc/default/sulogin
Default value can be set for the following flag:
PASSREQ
Determines if login requires a password. Default is PASSREQ=YES.
/etc/default/login
Default value can be set for the following flag:
SLEEPTIME
If present, sets the number of seconds to wait before login failure is printed to the screen and another login attempt is
allowed. Default is 4 seconds. Minimum is 0 seconds. Maximum is 5 seconds.
Both su(1M) and login(1) are affected by the value of SLEEPTIME.

By default, the root user has all authorizations.
Granting the solaris.system.maintenance authorization to the Console User Rights Profile may have an undesirable
side effect of granting the currently logged in user maintenance mode access. The solaris.system.maintenance au<hy>
thorization should be directly granted to appropriate users rather than through the Console User Rights Profile.
