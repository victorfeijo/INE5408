int picl_walk_tree_by_class(picl_nodehdl_t rooth,
 const char *classname, void *c_args,
 int (*callback)(picl_nodehdl_t nodeh, void *c_args));
The picl_walk_tree_by_class() function visits all the nodes of the subtree under the node specified by rooth. The
PICL class name of the visited node is compared with the class name specified by classname. If the class names
match, then the callback function specified by callback is called with the matching node handle and the argument
provided in c_args. If the class name specified in classname is NULL, then the callback function is invoked for all
the nodes.
The return value from the callback function is used to determine whether to continue or terminate the tree walk. The
callback function returns PICL_WALK_CONTINUE or PICL_WALK_TERMINATE to continue or terminate
the tree walk.
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. On failure, a non-negative integer is returned to indicate an error.
PICL_STALEHANDLE is returned if the handle is no longer valid. This occurs if the PICL tree was refreshed or
reinitialized.
PICL_INVALIDHANDLE is returned if the specified handle never existed. This error may be returned for a previ<hy>
ously valid handle if the daemon was brought down and restarted. When this occurs a client must revalidate any
saved handles.
PICL_NOTINITIALIZED Session not initialized
PICL_NORESPONSE Daemon not responding
PICL_NOTNODE Not a node
PICL_INVALIDHANDLE Invalid handle specified
PICL_STALEHANDLE Stale handle specified
PICL_FAILURE General system failure
