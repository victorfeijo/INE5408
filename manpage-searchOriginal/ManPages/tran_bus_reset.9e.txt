tran_bus_reset <-> reset a SCSI bus
#include <sys/scsi/scsi.h> int prefix
tran_bus_reset(dev_info_t *hba_dip, int level);
Solaris DDI
hba_dip The dev_info_t pointer associated with the SCSI HBA.
level The level of reset required.
The tran_bus_reset() vector in the scsi_hba_tran(9S) structure should be initialized during the HBA driver's at<hy>
tach(9E). It is an HBA entry point to be called when a user initiates a bus reset through device control interfaces.
tran_bus_reset() must reset the SCSI bus without resetting targets.
level will be one of the following:
RESET_BUS Reset the SCSI bus only, not the targets.
Implementation is hardware specific. If it is not possible to reset the SCSI bus without changing the state and operat<hy>
ing mode of the targets, the HBA driver should not initialize this vector or return failure.
tran_bus_reset() should return:
1 on success.
0 on failure.
