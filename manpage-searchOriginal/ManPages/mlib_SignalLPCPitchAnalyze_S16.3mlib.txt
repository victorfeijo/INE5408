The mlib_SignalLPCPitchAnalyze_S16() function performs open-loop pitch analysis.
The open-loop pitch analysis uses perceptual weighted signal and is done with following steps.
In the first step, three maxima of the correlation
   N-1
  R(k) = SUM sw(j) * sw(j-k)
   j=0
where N = length, is located for each of the three search regions.
In the second step, the retained maxima R(Ti), i=0,1,2 are normalized as following.
   R(Ti)
  Rn(ti) = ---------------------, i=0,1,2
   N-1 2
   SQRT(SUM sw(j-Ti) )
   j=0
where N = length.
In the third step, the best open-loop delay Topt is determined as following.
  Topt = T0
  if (Rn(t1) <>=> (0.85 * Rn(Topt))
   Topt = t1
  if (Rn(t2) <>=> (0.85 * Rn(Topt))
   Topt = t2
See G.729, G.729A, GSM EFR standards.
The function takes the following arguments:
pitch The speech pitch estimated.
sigwgt The weighted signal vector with samples in Q15 format. sigwgt points to the current sample of the weighted
signal vector, length samples must be availabe after this point, and MAX{region[i],i=0,1,...,5} samples must be
available before this point.
region The lower/upper boundaries of the three search regions, where region[2*i] is the lower boundary of search
region i and region[2*i+1] is the upper boundary of search region i.
length The length of the signal vectors over which the correlation is calculated.
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
