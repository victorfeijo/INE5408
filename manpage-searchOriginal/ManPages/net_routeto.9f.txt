phy_if_t net_routeto(const net_data_t *net, struct sockaddr *address,
 struct sockaddr *nexthop);
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
net value returned from a successful call to net_protocol_lookup(9F).
address network address to find a path out of the machine for.
nexthop pointer to the sockaddr structure in which to store the address of the next hop. If this information is not re<hy>
quired, the value NULL may be passed instead.
The net_routeto() function indicates which network interface packets destined for a particular address would be sent
out of, according to the systems network routing tables. If next is supplied as a non-NULL pointer, the IP address of
the nexthop router to be used is returned in it.
The net_routeto() function returns:
-1 The network protocol does not support this function.
0 This function cannot find a route for the address given.
>0 Indicates which network interface can be used to reach the given address.
The net_routeto() function may be called from user, kernel, or interrupt context.
