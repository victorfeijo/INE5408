strclean <-> STREAMS error logger cleanup program
strclean [-a age] [-d logdir]
strclean is used to clean up the STREAMS error logger directory on a regular basis (for example, by using cron. By
default, all files with names matching error.* in /var/adm/streams that have not been modified in the last three
days are removed.
The following options are supported:
-a age The maximum age in days for a log file can be changed using the -a option.
-d logdir A directory other than /var/adm/streams can be specified using the -d option.
Example 1 A sample of using the strclean command.
This example has the same result as running strclean with no arguments:
 example% strclean -d /var/adm/streams -a 3
/var/adm/streams/error.*
