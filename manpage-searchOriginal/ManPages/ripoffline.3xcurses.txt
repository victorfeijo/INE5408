int ripoffline(int line, int (*init)(WINDOW *win, int width));
line determines whether the screen line being reserved comes from the top of stdscr (line is positive) or the bottom
(line is negative).
init Is a pointer to a function that initializes the one-line window.
win Is a pointer to one-line window created by this function.
width Is the number of columns in the window pointed to by the win parameter.
The ripoffline() function reserves a screen line as a one line window.
To use this function, it must be called before you call initscr(3XCURSES) or newterm(3XCURSES). When
initscr() or newterm() is called, so is the function pointed to by init. The function pointed to by init takes two argu<hy>
ments: a pointer to the one-line window and the number of columns in that window. This function cannot use the
LINES or COLS variables and cannot call wrefresh(3XCURSES) or doupdate(3XCURSES), but may call
wnoutrefresh(3XCURSES).
The rioffline() function always returns OK.
None.
