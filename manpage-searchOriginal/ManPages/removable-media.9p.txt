removable-media <-> removable media device property
A device that supports removable media<em>such as CDROM, JAZZ, and ZIP drives<em>and that supports power man<hy>
agement and expects automatic mounting of the device via the volume manager should export the boolean (zero
length) property removable-media. This property enables the system to make the power state of the device depen<hy>
dent on the power state of the frame buffer and monitor. See the power.conf(4) discussion of the device-dependen<hy>
cy-property entry for more information.
Devices that behave like removable devices (such as PC ATA cards, where the controller and media both are re<hy>
moved at the same time) should also export this property. Example 1 removable-media Entry
An example of a removable-media entry from the .conf file of a driver is shown below.
 # This entry keeps removable media from being powered down unless
 # the console framebuffer and monitor are powered down
 #
 removable-media=1;
Example 2 Implementation in attach()
Below is an example of how the entry above would be implemented in the attach(9E) function of the driver.
 xxattach(dev_info_t *dip, ddi_attach_cmd_t cmd)
  {
  ...
  if (ddi_prop_create(DDI_DEV_T_NONE, dip, DDI_PROP_CANSLEEP,
  "removable-media", NULL, 0)) != DDI_PROP_SUCCESS)
  goto failed;
  ...
  }
