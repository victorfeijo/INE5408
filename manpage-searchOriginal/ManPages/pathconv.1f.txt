pathconv <-> search FMLI criteria for filename
pathconv [-f] [-v alias]
pathconv [-t] [-l] [-nnum] [-v string]
The pathconv function converts an alias to its pathname. By default, it takes the alias as a string from the standard
input.
-f If -f is specified, the full path will be returned (this is the default).
-t If -t is specified, pathconv will truncate a pathname specified in string in a format suitable for display as a frame
title. This format is a shortened version of the full pathname, created by deleting components of the path from the
middle of the string until it is under DISPLAYW <em> 6 characters in length, and then inserting ellipses ( ... ) be<hy>
tween the remaining pieces. Ellipses are also used to show truncation at the ends of the strings if necessary, unless
the -l option is given.
-l If -l is specified, < and > will be used instead of ellipses ( ... ) to indicate truncation at the ends of the string gen<hy>
erated by the -t option. Using -l allows display of the longest possible string while still notifying users it has been
truncated.
-nnum If -n is specified, num is the maximum length of the string (in characters) generated by the -t option. The ar<hy>
gument num can be any integer from 1 to 255.
-valias |string If the -v option is used, then alias or string can be specified when pathconv is called. The argument
alias must be an alias defined in the alias_file named when fmli was invoked. The argument string can only be used
with the -t option and must be a pathname.
Example 1 A sample that uses pathconv to construct the menu title. It searches for MYPATH in the alias_file
named when fmli command.
Here is a menu descriptor that uses pathconv to construct the menu title. It searches for MYPATH in the alias_file
named when fmli was invoked:
 menu=`pathconv -v MYPATH/ls`
  .
  .
  .
where there is a line in alias_file that defines MYPATH . For example, MYPATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/bin.
Here is a menu descriptor that takes alias from the standard input.
 menu=`echo MYPATH/ls | pathconv`
  .
  .
  .
