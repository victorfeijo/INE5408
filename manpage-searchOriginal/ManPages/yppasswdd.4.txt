yppasswdd <-> configuration file for rpc.yppasswdd (NIS password daemon)
/etc/default/yppasswdd
The yppasswdd file contains a parameter that modifies the behavior of the rpc.yppasswdd(1M) daemon.
The yppasswdd file contains a single parameter:
 #check_restricted_shell_name=1
By default in the current release, this line in yppasswdd is commented out. If you uncomment the line, when a user
attempts to change his default shell using `passwd -r nis -e` (see passwd(1)), the rpc.yppasswdd daemon checks
whether the name of the user's current shell begins with an 'r'. rpc.yppasswdd considers any shell whose name be<hy>
gins with an 'r' (for example, rcsh) to be a restricted shell. If a user's shell does begin with 'r', his attempt to change
from the default shell will fail.
If the line in the yppasswdd file is commented out (the default), the rpc.yppasswdd daemon does not perform the
restricted shell check.
The yppasswdd file is editable only by root or a member of the sys group.
