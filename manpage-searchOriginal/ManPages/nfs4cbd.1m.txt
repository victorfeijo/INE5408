nfs4cbd <-> NFS Version 4 callback daemon
/usr/lib/nfs/nfs4cbd
The nfs4cbd daemon manages communication endpoints for the NFS Version 4 protocol callback program. nfs4cbd
runs on the NFS Version 4 client and creates a listener port for each transport over which callbacks can be sent.
The nfs4cbd daemon is provided for the exclusive use of the NFS version 4 client.

The nfs4cbd service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/network/nfs/cbd
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). The service's status can be queried using the svcs(1) command.
If it is disabled, it will be enabled by mount_nfs(1M) and automountd(1M) on the first NFSv4 mount, unless its
application/auto_enable property is set to false.
This daemon might not exist in a future release of Solaris.
