These functions return the exponent part of their argument x. Formally, the return value is the integral part of log(r)|
x | as a signed integral value, for non-zero x, where r is the radix of the machine's floating point arithmetic, which is
the value of FLT_RADIX defined in <float.h>.
Upon successful completion, these functions return the exponent part of x as a signed integer value. They are equiv<hy>
alent to calling the corresponding logb(3M) function and casting the returned value to type int.
If x is 0, the value FP_ILOGB0 is returned. For SUSv3-conforming applications compiled with the c99 compiler
driver (see standards(5)), a domain error occurs.
If x is <+->Inf, the value INT_MAX is returned. For SUSv3-conforming applications compiled with the c99 compiler
driver, a domain error occurs.
If x is NaN, the value FP_ILOGBNAN is returned. For SUSv3-conforming applications compiled with the c99
compiler driver, a domain error occurs.
These functions will fail if:
Domain Error The x argument is zero, NaN, or <+->Inf.
If the integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the invalid floating-point
exception is raised.
