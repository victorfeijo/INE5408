int shutdown(int socket, int how);
The shutdown() function disables subsequent send() and receive() operations on a socket, depending on the value
of the how argument.
how Specifies the type of shutdown. The values are as follows:
SHUT_RD Disables further receive operations.
SHUT_WR Disables further send operations.
SHUT_RDWR Disables further send and receive operations.
socket Specifies the file descriptor of the socket.
Upon successful completion, shutdown() returns 0. Otherwise, <mi>1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
The shutdown() function will fail if:
EBADF The socket argument is not a valid file descriptor.
EINVAL The how argument is invalid.
ENOTCONN The socket is not connected.
ENOTSOCK The socket argument does not refer to a socket.
The shutdown() function may fail if:
ENOBUFS Insufficient resources were available in the system to perform the operation.
ENOSR There were insufficient STREAMS resources available for the operation to complete.
