int stmfGetLogicalUnitList(stmfGuidList **logicalUnitList);
logicalUnitList A pointer to a pointer to an stmfGuidList structure. On successful return, this will contain a list of
logical units in the system.
The stmfGetLogicalUnitList() function retrieves the list of logical units. The caller should call stmfFreeMemo<hy>
ry(3STMF) when this list is no longer needed.
The following values are returned:
STMF_ERROR_NOMEM The library was unable to allocate sufficient memory for logicalUnitList.
STMF_STATUS_SUCCESS The API call was successful.
