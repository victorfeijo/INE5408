Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI)
The SCSI-2standard defines a status byte that is normally sent by the target to the initiator during the status phase at
the completion of each command.
 uchar sts_scsi2 :1; /* SCSI-2 modifier bit */
 uchar sts_is :1; /* intermediate status sent */
 uchar sts_busy :1; /* device busy or reserved */
 uchar sts_cm :1; /* condition met */
 ucha sts_chk :1; /* check condition */
sts_chk indicates that a contingent allegiance condition has occurred.
sts_cm is returned whenever the requested operation is satisfied
sts_busy indicates that the target is busy. This status is returned whenever a target is unable to accept a command
from an otherwise acceptable initiator (that is, no reservation conflicts). The recommended initiator recovery action
is to issue the command again later.
sts_is is returned for every successfully completed command in a series of linked commands (except the last com<hy>
mand), unless the command is terminated with a check condition status, reservation conflict, or command terminated
status. Note that host bus adapter drivers may not support linked commands (see scsi_ifsetcap(9F)). If sts_is and
sts_busy are both set, then a reservation conflict has occurred.
sts_scsi2 is the SCSI-2 modifier bit. If sts_scsi2 and sts_chk are both set, this indicates a command terminated sta<hy>
tus. If sts_scsi2 and sts_busy are both set, this indicates that the command queue in the target is full.
For accessing the status as a byte, the following values are appropriate:
STATUS_GOOD
This status indicates that the target has successfully completed the command.
STATUS_CHECK
This status indicates that a contingent allegiance condition has occurred.
STATUS_MET
This status is returned when the requested operations are satisfied.
STATUS_BUSY
This status indicates that the target is busy.
STATUS_INTERMEDIATE
This status is returned for every successfully completed command in a series of linked commands.
STATUS_SCSI2
This is the SCSI-2 modifier bit.
STATUS_INTERMEDIATE_MET
This status is a combination of STATUS_MET and STATUS_INTERMEDIATE.

STATUS_RESERVATION_CONFLICT
This status is a combination of STATUS_INTERMEDIATE and STATUS_BUSY, and it is returned whenever an
initiator attempts to access a logical unit or an extent within a logical unit is reserved.
STATUS_TERMINATED
This status is a combination of STATUS_SCSI2 and STATUS_CHECK, and it is returned whenever the target ter<hy>
minates the current I/O process after receiving a terminate I/O process message.
STATUS_QFULL
This status is a combination of STATUS_SCSI2 and STATUS_BUSY, and it is returned when the command queue
in the target is full.
