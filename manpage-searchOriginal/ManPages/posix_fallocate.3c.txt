posix_fallocate <-> file space control
#include <fcntl.h>
int posix_fallocate(int fd, off_t offset, off_t len);
The posix_fallocate() function ensures that any required storage for regular file data starting at offset and continuing
for len bytes is allocated on the file system storage media. If posix_fallocate() returns successfully, subsequent
writes to the specified file data will not fail due to the lack of free space on the file system storage media.
If the offset+len is beyond the current file size, then posix_fallocate() adjusts the file size to offset+len. Otherwise,
the file size is not changed.
Space allocated with posix_fallocate() is freed by a successful call to creat(2) or open(2) that truncates the size of
the file. Space allocated with posix_fallocate() may be freed by a successful call to ftruncate(3C) that reduces the
file size to a size smaller than offset+len.
Upon successful completion, posix_fallocate() returns zero. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the
error.
The posix_fallocate() function will fail if:
EBADF The fd argument is not a valid file descriptor or references a file that was opened without write permission.
EFBIG The value of offset+len is greater than the maximum file size.
EINTR A signal was caught during execution.
EINVAL The len argument is less than or equal to zero, or the offset argument is less than zero, or the underlying
file system does not support this operation.
EIO An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to a file system.
ENODEV The fd argument does not refer to a regular file.
ENOSPC There is insufficient free space remaining on the file system storage media.
ESPIPE The fd argument is associated with a pipe or FIFO.
The posix_fallocate() function has a transitional interface for 64-bit file offsets. See lf64(5).
