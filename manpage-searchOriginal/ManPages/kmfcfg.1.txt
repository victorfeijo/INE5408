kmfcfg <-> Key Management Policy and Plugin Configuration Utility
kmfcfg subcommand [option ...]
The kmfcfg command allows users to configure Key Management Framework (KMF) policy databases. The KMF
policy database (DB) restricts the use of keys and certificates that are managed through the KMF framework.
kmfcfg provides the ability to list, create, modify, delete, import and export policy definitions either in the system
default database file /etc/security/kmfpolicy.xml or a user-defined database file.
For plugin configuration, kmfcfg allows users to display plugin information, install or uninstall a KMF plugin, and
modify the plugin option.
The following subcommands are supported:
create
Adds a new policy into the policy database file.
The format for the create subcommand is as follows:
 create [dbfile=dbfile] policy=policyname
  [ignore-date=true|false]
  [ignore-unknown-eku=true|false]
  [ignore-trust-anchor=true|false]
  [validity-adjusttime=adjusttime]
  [ta-name=trust anchor subject DN]
  [ta-serial=trust anchor serial number]
  [ocsp-responder=URL]
  [ocsp-proxy=URL]
  [ocsp-use-cert-responder=true|false]
  [ocsp-response-lifetime=timelimit]
  [ocsp-ignore-response-sign=true|false]
  [ocsp-responder-cert-name=Issuer DN]
  [ocsp-responder-cert-serial=serial number]
  [crl-basefilename=basefilename]
  [crl-directory=directory]
  [crl-get-crl-uri=true|false]
  [crl-proxy=URL]
  [crl-ignore-crl-sign=true|false]
  [crl-ignore-crl-date=true|false]
  [keyusage=digitalSignature|nonRepudiation
  |keyEncipherment | dataEncipherment |
  keyAgreement |keyCertSign |
  cRLSign | encipherOnly | decipherOnly],[...]
  [ekunames=serverAuth | clientAuth |
  codeSigning | emailProtection |
  ipsecEndSystem | ipsecTunnel |
  ipsecUser | timeStamping |
  OCSPSigning],[...]
  [ekuoids=OID,OID,OID...]
The create subcommand supports the following options:
crl-basefilename=filename
crl-directory=directory
These two attributes are used to specify the location for CRL files. The crl-basefilename attribute represents the
base filename for a CRL file. The crl-directory attribute represents the directory for CRL files, which defaults to the
current directory.
If the crl-get-crl-uri attribute is set to true and the crl-basefilename is not specified, the basefilename for the
cached CRL file is the basename of the URI used to fetch the CRL file.
If the crl-get-crl-uri attribute is set to false the crl-basefilename needs to be specified to indicate an input CRL file.
The setting for crl-get-crl-uri is false by default.
<beginning of page>
These two attributes only apply to the file-based CRL plugins. The current file-based CRL plugins are file and
pkcs11 keystores. For the nss keystore, the CRL location is always the NSS internal database.
crl-get-crl-uri=true | false
Configure if a CRL file is fetched and cached dynamically as part of the certificate validation, using the URI infor<hy>
mation from the certificate's distribution points extension.
The default for this attribute is false.
crl-ignore-crl-date=true | false
If crl-ignore-crl-date is set to true, the validity time period of the CRL is not checked.
The default for this attribute is false.
crl-ignore-crl-sign=true | false
If crl-ignore-crl-sign is set to true, the signature of the CRL is not checked.
The default for this attribute is false.
crl-proxy= URL
Sets the proxy server name and port for dynamically retrieving a CRL file when crl-get-crl-uri is set to true.
The port number is optional. If the port number is not specified, the default value is 8080. An example crl-proxy set<hy>
ting might be: crl-proxy=webcache.sfbay:8080.
dbfile=dbfile
The DB file to add the new policy. If not specified, the default is the system KMF policy database file /etc/securi<hy>
ty/kmfpolicy.xml.
ekuoids=EKUOIDS
A comma separated list of Extended Key Usage OIDs that are required by the policy being defined. The OIDs are
expressed in dot notation, for example, 1.2.3.4. An example ekuoids setting might be: ekuoids=1.2.3.4,9.8.7.6.5.
ekunames=EKUNAMES
A comma separated list of Extended Key Usage names that are required by the policy being defined. The list of val<hy>
ues allowed for EKUNAMES are: serverAuth, clientAuth, codeSigning, emailProtection, ipsecEndSystem, ipsec<hy>
Tunnel, ipsecUser, timeStamping, and OCSPSigning
The OCSP, CRL, key usage and extended key usage checkings are off by default. To turn on any one of them, speci<hy>
fy one or more attributes for the particular checking. For example, if the ocsp-responder attribute is set, then the
OCSP checking is turned on. If the ekuname attribute or the ekuoids attribute is set, then the extended key usage
checking is turned on.
ignore-date=true | false
Set the Ignore Date option for this policy. By default this value is false. If true is specified, the policy ignores the
validity periods defined in the certificates when evaluating their validity.
ignore-unknown-eku=true | false
Set the Ignore Unknown EKU option for this policy. By default this value is false. If true, the policy ignores any
unrecognized EKU values in the Extended Key Usage extension.
<beginning of page>
ignore-trust-anchor=true | false
Set the Ignore Trust Anchor option for this policy. By default this value is false. If true is specified, the policy does
not verify the signature of the subject certificate using trust anchor certificate at validation.
keyusage=KUVALUES
A comma separated list of key usage values that are required by the policy being defined. The list of values allowed
are: digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment, keyAgreement, keyCertSign,
cRLSign, encipherOnly, decipherOnly
ocsp-ignore-response-sign=true | false
If this attribute is set to true, the signature of the OCSP response is not verified. This attribute value is default to
false.
ocsp-proxy=URL
Set the proxy server name and port for OCSP. The port number is optional. If the port number is not specified, the
default value is 8080. An example ocsp-proxy setting might be: ocsp-proxy="webcache.sfbay:8080"
ocsp-response-lifetime=timelimit
Set the freshness period that a response must be. The timelimit can be specified by number-day, number-hour,
number-minute, or number-second. An example ocsp-response-lifetime setting might be:ocsp-response-life<hy>
time=6-hour.
ocsp-responder-cert-name=IssuerDN
ocsp-responder-cert-serial=serialNumber
These two attributes represent the OCSP responder certificate. The ocsp-responder-cert-name is to specify the is<hy>
suer name of the certificate. See the ta-name option for example. The ocsp-responder-cert-serial is for the serial
number and must be specified as a hex value, for example, 0x0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f. If an OCSP re<hy>
sponder is different from the issuer of the certificate and if the OCSP response needs to be verified, an OCSP respon<hy>
der certificate information should be provided.
ocsp-responder=URL
Set the OCSP responder URL for use with the OCSP validation method. For example, ocsp-responder=http://oc<hy>
sp.verisign.com/ocsp/status
ocsp-use-cert-responder=true | false
Configure this policy to always use the responder defined in the certificate itself if possible.
policy=policyname
The policy record to be created. policyname is required.
validity-adjusttime=adjusttime
Set the adjust time for both ends of validity period for a certificate. The time can be specified by number-day,
number-hour, number-minute, or number-second. An example validity-adjusttime setting might be: validity-ad<hy>
justtime=6-hour. ta-name="Subject DN" ta-serial=serialNumber
These two attributes represent the trust anchor certificate and are used to find the trust anchor certificate in the
keystore. The ta-name is to specify the distinguished name of the trust anchor certificate subject name. For example,
ta-name="O=Sun Microsystems Inc.,  OU=Solaris Security Technologies Group,  L=Ashburn, ST=VA, C=US,
CN=John Smith" The serial number of the TA certificate. This, along with the Issuer DN, is used to find the TA
certificate in the keystore. The serial number must be specified as a hex value, for example,
<beginning of page>
0x0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e The trust anchor attributes need to be set, if the value of ignore-trust-anchor
attribute is false.

policy database cannot be modified.
install keystore=keystore_name modulepath=pathname\ [option=option_str]
Install a plugin into the system. The modulepath field specifies the pathname to a KMF plugin shared library object.
If pathname is not specified as an absolute pathname, shared library objects are assumed to be relative to /lib/securi<hy>
ty/$ISA/. The ISA token is replaced by an implementation defined directory name which defines the pathname rela<hy>
tive to the calling program's instruction set architecture.
list plugin
Display KMF plugin information.
Without the pluginkeyword, kmfcfg list shows the policy information as described in the SUBCOMMANDS sec<hy>
tion.
modify plugin keystore=keystore_name option=option_str
Modify the plugin option. The plugin option is defined by the plugin and is interpreted by the plugin specifically,
therefore this command accepts any option string.
Without the plugin keyword, kmfcfg modify updates the policy configuration as described in the SUBCOM<hy>
MANDS section.
uninstall keystore=keystore_name
Uninstall the plugin with the keystore_name.
