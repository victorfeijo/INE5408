The pntadm command is used to manage the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) network tables. It is
used to add and remove networks under DHCP management, and add, delete, or modify IP address records within
network tables, or to view tables. For a description of the format of DHCP network tables, see dhcp_network(4).
pntadm can be run as root or by other users assigned to the DHCP Management profile. See rbac(5) and user_at<hy>
tr(4).
If the networks you want to add are subnetted, you need to update the netmasks(4) table.
One of the following options (function flags) must be specified with the pntadm command: -A, -B, -C, -D, -L, -M,
-P, or-R.
The following options are supported:
-A name_IP_address Add a client entry with hostname or client IP address, name_IP_address, to the named DHCP
network table.
The following sub-options are optional:
-c comment Comment text. The default is NULL.
-e mm/dd/yyyy Absolute lease. The default is 0.
-f num | keywords Flag value. The default is 00.
The flag (-f) option can be specified either as a single number denoting the intended flag value, or as a series of the
following keywords, combined using the plus (+) symbol:
DYNAMIC or 00 Server manager's assignment.
PERMANENT or 01 Lease on entry is permanent.
MANUAL or 02 Administrator managed assignment.
<beginning of page>
UNUSABLE or 04 Entry is not valid.
BOOTP or 08 Entry reserved for BOOTP clients.
For a more detailed description of the flag values, see dhcp_network(4).
-h client_hostname Client hostname. The default is NULL.
When the -h option is used in this mode, the client_hostname is added to the hosts table within the resource used for
storing host names (files, NIS+ or DNS). The command will fail if this client_hostname is already present in the
hosts table.
-i client_ID [-a] Client identifier [-a]. The default is 00.
The -i option modified with -a specifies that the client identifier is in ASCII format, and thus needs to be converted
to hexadecimal format before insertion into the table.
-m macro [-y] Macro name. Default is UNKNOWN.
The -m option modified with -y verifies the existence of the named macro in the dhcptab table before adding the en<hy>
try.
-s server Server IP or name. Default is system name (uname -n).
-B Activate batch mode. pntadm will read from the specified file or from standard input a series of pntadm com<hy>
mands and execute them within the same process. Processing many pntadm commands using this method is much
faster than running an executable batchfile itself. Batch mode is recommended for using pntadm in scripts.
The following sub-option is optional:
-v Display commands to standard output as they are processed.
-C Create the DHCP network table for the network specified by network. See . For details, see dhcp_network(4)
and networks(4).
-D name_IP_address Delete the specified client entry with hostname or client IP address, name_IP_address, in the
named DHCP network table. (See dhcp_network(4).)
The following sub-option is optional:
-y Remove associated host table entry. The -y option requests that all hostnames associated with the IP address in
the hosts table in the resource be removed.
-L List the DHCP network tables presently configured, one per line, on standard output. If none are found, no output
is printed and an exit status of 0 is returned.
-M name_IP_address Modify the specified client entry with hostname or client IP address, name_IP_address, in the
named DHCP network table. See dhcp_network(4). The default for the sub-options is what they currently are set
to.
The following sub-options are optional.
<beginning of page>
-c comment New comment text.
-e mm/dd/yy New absolute lease expiration date. Time defaults to 12:00 AM of the day specified.
-f num | keyboard New flag value, see explanation following the description of the -A option.
-h host_name New client hostname.
The -h option allows you to change the current hostname associated with the IP address or to add a new hostname to
the hosts table if an entry associated with this IP address does not exist.
-i client_ID New client identifier [-a].
-m macro [-y] Macro name defined in dhcptab.
-n new_client_IP_address New IP address.
-s server New server IP or name.
 For more detailed description of the sub-options and flag values, see dhcp_network(4).
-P Display the named DHCP network table.
The following sub-options are optional:
-v Display lease time in full verbose format and resolve IP addresses for the clients and server to hostnames.
-x Display lease time in raw format.
These flag codes are used with the -P sub-options:
tab(); lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) -v-xDescription D00DYNAMIC P01PERMA<hy>
NENT M02MANUAL U04UNUSABLE B08BOOTP
See dhcp_network(4) for information on these sub-options and associated flag codes.
-p path Override the dhcpsvc.conf(4) configuration value for data store resource path, path See dhcpsvc.conf(4)
-R Remove the named DHCP network table. See dhcp_network(4).
-r data_store_resource Override the /etc/inet/dhcpsvc.conf configuration value for RESOURCE= with the da<hy>
ta_store_resource specified. See the dhcpsvc.conf(4) man page for more details on resource type, and the for more
information about adding support for other data stores.
-u uninterpreted Data which will be ignored by pntadm, but passed to the currently configured public module to be
interpreted by the data store. This might be used for a database account name or other authentication or authorization
parameters required by a particular data store.
The following operand is supported:
<beginning of page>
network The network address or network name which corresponds to the dhcp network table. See dhcp_net<hy>
work(4).
Example 1 Creating a Table for the 10.0.0.0 DHCP Network
The following command creates a table for the 10.0.0.0 (subnetted to class C) DHCP network table. Note that if you
have an alias for this network in your networks(4) table, you can use that value rather than the dotted Internet Ad<hy>
dress notation.
 example# pntadm -C 10.0.0.0
Example 2 Adding an Entry to the 10.0.0.0 Table
The following command adds an entry to the 10.0.0.0 table in the files resource in the /var/mydhcp directory:
 example# pntadm -r SUNWfiles -p /var/mydhcp -A 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.0
Example 3 Modifying the 10.0.0.1 Entry of the 10.0.0.0 Table
The following command modifies the 10.0.0.1 entry of the 10.0.0.0 table, changing the macro name to Green, set<hy>
ting the flags field to MANUAL and PERMANENT:
 example# pntadm -M 10.0.0.1 -m Green -f 'PERMANENT+MANUAL' 10.0.0.0
Example 4 Changing the 10.0.0.1 Entry to 10.0.0.2
The following command changes the 10.0.0.1 entry to 10.0.0.2, making an entry in the hosts(4) table called my<hy>
client:
 example# pntadm -M 10.0.0.1 -n 10.0.0.2 -h myclient 10.0.0.0
Example 5 Setting the Client ID as ASCII
The following command sets the client ID as ASCII aruba.foo.com for the myclient entry:
 example# pntadm -M myclient -i 'aruba.foo.com' -a 10.0.0.0
Example 6 Deleting the myclientEntry from the 10.0.0.0 Table
The following command deletes the myclient (10.0.0.2) entry from the 10.0.0.0 table:
 example# pntadm -D myclient 10.0.0.0
Example 7 Removing the Named DHCP Network Table
The following command removes the named DHCP network table in the NIS+ directory specified:
 example# pntadm -r SUNWnisplus -p Test.Nis.Plus. -R 10.0.0.0
Example 8 Listing the Configured DHCP Network Tables
The following command lists the configured DHCP network tables:
<beginning of page>
 example# pntadm -L
 192.168.0.0
 10.0.0.0
Example 9 Executing pntadm Commands in Batch Mode
The following command runs a series of pntadm commands contained in a batch file:
 example# pntadm -B addclients
0 Successful completion.
1 Object already exists.
2 Object does not exist.
3 Non-critical error.
4 Critical error.
