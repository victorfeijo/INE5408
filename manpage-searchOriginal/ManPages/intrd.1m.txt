intrd <-> interrupt distribution daemon
/usr/lib/intrd
The intrd daemon is started at boot time to monitor the assignments between interrupts and CPUs. If intrd decides
that the current assignments are imbalanced and harmful to system performance, it will generate and implement new
assignments.
Any notifications will be delivered via syslogd(1M).
Because intrd dynamically monitors a system for optimal performance, it consumes a small amount of CPU time,
even on an otherwise idle system. This behavior is normal.

The interrupt distribution daemon is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifi<hy>
er:
 svc:/system/intrd:default
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). The service's status can be queried using the svcs(1) command.
