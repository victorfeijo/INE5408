gencat <-> generate a formatted message catalog
gencat catfile msgfile...
The gencat command merges the message text source file(s) msgfile into a formatted message database catfile. The
database catfile is created if it does not already exist. If catfile does exist, its messages are included in the new cat<hy>
file. If set and message numbers collide, the new message-text defined in msgfile replaces the old message text cur<hy>
rently contained in catfile. The message text source file (or set of files) input to gencat can contain either set and
message numbers or simply message numbers, in which case the set NL_SETD (see nl_types.h(3HEAD)) is as<hy>
sumed.
The format of a message text source file is defined as follows. Note that the fields of a message text source line are
separated by a single ASCII space or tab character. Any other ASCII spaces or tabs are considered as part of the
subsequent field.
$set n comment Where n specifies the set identifier of the following messages until the next $set, $delset, or end-of-
file appears. n must be a number in the range (1-{NL_SETMAX}). Set identifiers within a single source file need
not be contiguous. Any string following the set identifier is treated as a comment. If no $set directive is specified in
a message text source file, all messages are located in the default message set NL_SETD.
$delset n comment Deletes message set n from an existing message catalog. Any string following the set number is
treated as a comment. (Note: if n is not a valid set it is ignored.)
$comment A line beginning with a dollar symbol $ followed by an ASCII space or tab character is treated as a com<hy>
ment.
m message-text The m denotes the message identifier, a number in the range (1-{NL_MSGMAX}). The message-
text is stored in the message catalog with the set identifier specified by the last $set directive, and with message iden<hy>
tifier m. If the message-text is empty, and an ASCII space or tab field separator is present, an empty string is stored
in the message catalog. If a message source line has a message number, but neither a field separator nor message-
text, the existing message with that number (if any) is deleted from the catalog. Message identifiers need not be con<hy>
tiguous. The length of message-text must be in the range (0-{NL_TEXTMAX}).
$quote c This line specifies an optional quote character c, which can be used to surround message-text so that trail<hy>
ing spaces or null (empty) messages are visible in a message source line. By default, or if an empty $quote directive
is supplied, no quoting of message-text will be recognized.
Empty lines in a message text source file are ignored.
Text strings can contain the special characters and escape sequences defined in the following table:
tab() box; lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) DescriptionSymbolSequence newlineNL(LF)\n
horizontal tabHT\t vertical tabVT\v backspaceBS\b carriage returnCR\r form feedFF \f backslash\\\ bit patternd<hy>
dd\ddd
The escape sequence \ddd consists of backslash followed by 1, 2 or 3 octal digits, which are taken to specify the val<hy>
ue of the desired character. If the character following a backslash is not one of those specified, the backslash is ig<hy>
nored.
Backslash followed by an ASCII newline character is also used to continue a string on the following line. Thus, the
following two lines describe a single message string:
 1 This line continues \
 to the next line
which is equivalent to:
<beginning of page>
  1 This line continues to the next line
The following operands are supported:
catfile A path name of the formatted message catalog. If <mi> is specified, standard output is used.
msgfile A path name of a message text source file. If <mi> is specified for an instance of msgfile, standard input is used.
The format of message text source files is defined in Message Text Source File Format.
