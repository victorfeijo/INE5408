fmlgrep <-> search a file for a pattern
fmlgrep [-b] [-c] [-i] [-l] [-n] [-s] [-v]
 limited_regular_expression [filename]...
fmlgrep searches filename for a pattern and prints all lines that contain that pattern. fmlgrep uses limited regular ex<hy>
pressions (expressions that have string values that use a subset of the possible alphanumeric and special characters)
like those described on the regexp(5) manual page to match the patterns. It uses a compact non-deterministic algo<hy>
rithm.
Be careful when using FMLI special characters (for instance, $, `, ', ") in limited_regular_expression. It is safest to
enclose the entire limited_regular_expression in single quotes ' ... '.
If filename is not specified, fmlgrep assumes standard input. Normally, each line matched is copied to standard out<hy>
put. The file name is printed before each line matched if there is more than one input file.
The following options are supported:
-b Precede each line by the block number on which it was found. This can be useful in locating block numbers by
context (first block is 0).
-c Print only a count of the lines that contain the pattern.
-i Ignore upper/lower case distinction during comparisons.
-l Print only the names of files with matching lines, separated by new-lines. Does not repeat the names of files when
the pattern is found more than once.
-n Precede each line by its line number in the file (first line is 1).
-s Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.
-v Print all lines except those that contain the pattern.
The following exit values are returned:
0 if the pattern is found (that is, TRUE)
1 if the pattern is not found (that is, FALSE)
2 if an invalid expression was used or filename is inaccessible

Lines are limited to BUFSIZ characters; longer lines are truncated. BUFSIZ is defined in /usr/include/stdio.h.
If there is a line with embedded nulls, fmlgrep will only match up to the first null; if it matches, it will print the en<hy>
tire line.
