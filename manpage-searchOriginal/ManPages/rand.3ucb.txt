rand() uses a multiplicative congruential random number generator with period 2^32 to return successive pseudo-
random numbers in the range from 0 to 2^31 <mi>1.
srand() can be called at any time to reset the random-number generator to a random starting point. The generator is
initially seeded with a value of 1.

Use of these interfaces should be restricted to only applications written on BSD platforms. Use of these interfaces
with any of the system libraries or in multi-thread applications is unsupported.
The spectral properties of rand() leave a great deal to be desired. drand48(3C) and random(3C) provide much bet<hy>
ter, though more elaborate, random-number generators.
The low bits of the numbers generated are not very random; use the middle bits. In particular the lowest bit alter<hy>
nates between 0 and 1.
