nisinit <-> NIS+ client and server initialization utility
nisinit -r
nisinit -p Y | D | N parent_domain host...
nisinit -c [-k <key_domain>] -H host | -B | -C coldstart
nisinit initializes a machine to be a NIS+ client or an NIS+ root master server. It may be easier to use nisclient(1M)
or nisserver(1M) to accomplish this same task.
-r
Initialize the machine to be a NIS+ root server. This option creates the file /var/nis/data/root.object and initialize it
to contain information about this machine. It uses the sysinfo(2) system call to retrieve the name of the default do<hy>
main.
To initialize the machine as an NIS+ root server, it is advisable to use the "-r" option of nisserver(1M), instead of
using "nisinit -r".
-p Y | D | N parent_domain host ...
This option is used on a root server to initialize a /var/nis/data/parent.object to make this domain a part of the
namespace above it. Only root servers can have parent objects. A parent object describes the namespace ``above''
the NIS+ root. If this is an isolated domain, this option should not be used. The argument to this option tells the
command what type of name server is serving the domain above the NIS+ domain. When clients attempt to resolve a
name that is outside of the NIS+ namespace, this object is returned with the error NIS_FOREIGNNS indicating that
a name space boundary has been reached. It is up to the client to continue the name resolution process.
The parameter parent_domain is the name of the parent domain in a syntax that is native to that type of domain. The
list of host names that follow the domain parameter are the names of hosts that serve the parent domain. If there is
more than one server for a parent domain, the first host specified should be the master server for that domain.
Y Specifies that the parent directory is a NIS version 2 domain.
D Specifies that the parent directory is a DNS domain.
N Specifies that the parent directory is another NIS+ domain. This option is useful for connecting a pre-existing
NIS+ subtree into the global namespace.
Note that in the current implementation, the NIS+ clients do not take advantage of the -p feature. Also, since the par<hy>
ent object is currently not replicated on root replica servers, it is recommended that this option not be used.
-c
Initializes the machine to be a NIS+ client. There are three initialization options available: initialize by coldstart, ini<hy>
tialize by hostname, and initialize by broadcast. The most secure mechanism is to initialize from a trusted coldstart
file. The second option is to initialize using a hostname that you specify as a trusted host. The third method is to ini<hy>
tialize by broadcast and it is the least secure method.
-C coldstart Causes the file coldstart to be used as a prototype coldstart file when initializing a NIS+ client. This
coldstart file can be copied from a machine that is already a client of the NIS+ namespace. For maximum security,
an administrator can encrypt and encode (with uuencode(1C)) the coldstart file and mail it to an administrator bring<hy>
ing up a new machine. The new administrator would then decode (with uudecode), decrypt, and then use this file
with the nisinit command to initialize the machine as an NIS+ client. If the coldstart file is from another client in the
same domain, the nisinit command may be safely skipped and the file copied into the /var/nis directory as
/var/nis/NIS_COLD_START.
-H hostname Specifies that the host hostname should be contacted as a trusted NIS+ server. The nisinit command
will iterate over each transport in the NETPATH environment variable and attempt to contact rpcbind(1M) on that
machine. This hostname must be reachable from the client without the name service running. For IP networks this
means that there must be an entry in /etc/hosts for this host when nisinit is invoked.

-B Specifies that the nisinit command should use an IP broadcast to locate a NIS+ server on the local subnet. Any
machine that is running the NIS+ service may answer. No guarantees are made that the server that answers is a serv<hy>
er of the organization's namespace. If this option is used, it is advisable to check with your system administrator that
the server and domain served are valid. The binding information can be dumped to the standard output using the nis<hy>
showcache(1M) command.
Note that nisinit -c will just enable navigation of the NIS+ name space from this client. To make NIS+ your name
service, modify the file /etc/nsswitch.conf to reflect that. See nsswitch.conf(4) for more details.
-k <key_domain>
This option specifies the domain where root's credentials are stored. If it is not specified, then the system default do<hy>
main is assumed. This domain name is used to create the /var/nis/NIS_COLD_START file.
nisinit returns 0 on success and 1 on failure. Example 1 Initializing the Machine as an NIS+ Client using the Host
freddy as a Trusted Server
This example initializes the machine as an NIS+ client using the host freddy as a trusted server.
 example# nisinit -cH freddy
Example 2 Setting up a Client using a Trusted Coldstart File
This example sets up a client using a trusted coldstart file.
 example# nisinit -cC /tmp/colddata
Example 3 Setting up a Client Using an IP Broadcast
This example sets up a client using an IP broadcast.
 example# nisinit -cB
Example 4 Setting up a Root Server
This example sets up a root server.
 example# nisinit -r
NETPATH This environment variable may be set to the transports to try when contacting the NIS+ server (see net<hy>
config(4)). The client library will only attempt to contact the server using connection oriented transports.
/var/nis/NIS_COLD_START
This file contains a list of servers, their transport addresses, and their Secure RPC public keys that serve the ma<hy>
chine's default domain.
/var/nis/data/root.object
This file describes the root object of the NIS+ namespace. It is a standard XDR-encoded NIS+ directory object that
can be modified by authorized clients using the nis_modify() interface.
<beginning of page>
/var/nis/data/parent.object
This file describes the namespace that is logically above the NIS+ namespace. The most common type of parent ob<hy>
ject is a DNS object. This object contains contact information for a server of that domain.
/etc/hosts
Internet host table.

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
NIS+ to LDAP are available in the current Solaris release. For more information, visit http://www.sun.com/directo<hy>
