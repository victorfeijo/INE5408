int lgrp_latency_cookie(lgrp_cookie_t cookie, lgrp_id_t from,
 lgrp_id_t to, lgrp_lat_between_t between);
int lgrp_latency(lgrp_id_t from, lgrp_id_t to);
The lgrp_latency_cookie() function takes a cookie representing a snapshot of the lgroup hierarchy obtained from
lgrp_init(3LGRP) and returns the latency value between a hardware resource in the from lgroup to a hardware re<hy>
source in the to lgroup. If from is the same lgroup as to, the latency value within that lgroup is returned.
The between argument should be set to the following value to specify between which hardware resources the latency
should be measured:
 LGRP_LAT_CPU_TO_MEM /* latency from CPU to memory */
The latency value is defined by the operating system and is platform-specific. It can be used only for relative com<hy>
parison of lgroups on the running system. It does not necessarily represent the actual latency between hardware de<hy>
vices, and it might not be applicable across platforms.
The lgrp_latency() function is similiar to the lgrp_latency_cookie() function, but returns the latency between the
given lgroups at the given instant in time. Since lgroups can be freed and reallocated, this function might not be able
to provide a consistent answer across calls. For that reason, the lgrp_latency_cookie() function should be used in its
place.
Upon successful completion, the latency value is returned. Otherwise <mi>1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the
error.
The lgrp_latency_cookie() and lgrp_latency() functions will fail if:
EINVAL The specified cookie, lgroup ID, or value given for the between argument is not valid.
ESRCH The specified lgroup ID was not found, the from lgroup does not contain any CPUs, or the to lgroup does
not have any memory.
