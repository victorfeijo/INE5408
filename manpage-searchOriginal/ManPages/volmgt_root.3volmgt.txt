const char *volmgt_root(void);
This function is obsolete. The management of removable media by the Volume Management feature, including vold,
has been replaced by software that supports the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). Programmatic support for HAL
is through the HAL APIs, which are documented on the HAL web site. See hal(5). The return value of this function
is undefined.
The volmgt_root() function returns the current volume management root directory, which by default is /vol but can
be configured to be in a different location.
The return from this function is undefined.
This function may fail if an open() of /dev/volctl fails. If this occurs a pointer to the default Volume Management
root directory is returned. Example 1 Finding the Volume Management Root directory.
To find out where the volume management root directory is:
 if ((path = volmgt_root()) != NULL) {
  (void) printf("Volume Management root dir=%s\n", path);
 } else {
  (void) printf("can't find Volume Management root dir\n");
 }
/dev default location for the volume management root directory
