DAT_RETURN
 dat_ep_post_send (
 IN DAT_EP_HANDLE ep_handle,
 IN DAT_COUNT num_segments,
 IN DAT_LMR_TRIPLET *local_iov,
 IN DAT_DTO_COOKIE user_cookie,
 IN DAT_COMPLETION_FLAGS completion_flags
 )
ep_handle Handle for an instance of the Endpoint.
num_segments Number of lmr_triplets in local_iov. Can be 0 for 0 size message.
local_iov I/O Vector that specifies the local buffer that contains data to be transferred. Can be NULL for 0 size mes<hy>
sage.
user_cookie: User-provided cookie that is returned to the Consumer at the completion of the send. Can be NULL.
completion_flags Flags for posted Send. The default DAT_COMPLETION_DEFAULT_FLAG is 0x00. Other val<hy>
ues are as follows:
Completion Suppression DAT_COMPLETION_SUPPRESS_FLAG
0x01 Suppress successful Completion.
Solicited Wait DAT_COMPLETION_SOLICITED_WAIT_FLAG
0x02 Request for notification completion for matching receive on the other side of the connection.
Notification of Completion DAT_COMPLETION_UNSIGNALLED_FLAG
0x04 Non-notification completion. Local Endpoint must be configured for Notification Suppression.
Barrier Fence DAT_COMPLETION_BARRIER_FENCE_FLAG
0x08 Request for Barrier Fence.
The dat_ep_post_send() function requests a transfer of all the data from the local_iov over the connection of the
ep_handle Endpoint to the remote side.
The num_segments parameter specifies the number of segments in the local_iov. The local_iov segments are tra<hy>
versed in the I/O Vector order until all the data is transferred.
A Consumer cannot modify the local_iov or its content until the DTO is completed. When a Consumer does not ad<hy>
here to this rule, the behavior of the Provider and the underlying Transport is not defined. Providers that allow Con<hy>
sumers to get ownership of the local_iov back after the dat_ep_post_send() returns should document this behavior
and also specify its support in Provider attributes. This behavior allows Consumers full control of the local_iov, but
not the memory it specifies after dat_ep_post_send() returns. Because this behavior is not guaranteed by all
<beginning of page>
Providers, portable Consumers should not rely on this behavior. Consumers should not rely on the Provider copying
local_iov information.
The DAT_SUCCESS return of the dat_ep_post_send() is at least the equivalent of posting a Send operation direct<hy>
ly by native Transport. Providers should avoid resource allocation as part of dat_ep_post_send() to ensure that this
operation is nonblocking and thread safe for an UpCall.
The completion of the posted Send is reported to the Consumer asynchronously through a DTO Completion event
based on the specified completion_flags value. The value of DAT_COMPLETION _UNSIGNALLED_FLAG is
only valid if the Endpoint Request Completion Flags DAT_COMPLETION_UNSIGNALLED_FLAG. Otherwise,
DAT_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned.
The user_cookie allows Consumers to have unique identifiers for each DTO. These identifiers are completely under
user control and are opaque to the Provider. There is no requirement on the Consumer that the value user_cookie
should be unique for each DTO. The user_cookie is returned to the Consumer in the Completion event for the posted
Send.
The operation is valid for the Endpoint in the DAT_EP_STATE_CONNECTED and DAT_EP_STATE_DISCON<hy>
NECTED states. If the operation returns successfully for the Endpoint in the DAT_EP_STATE_DISCONNECT<hy>
ED state, the posted Send is immediately flushed to request_evd_handle.
DAT_SUCCESS The operation was successful.
DAT_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES The operation failed due to resource limitations.
DAT_INVALID_PARAMETER Invalid parameter. For example, one of the IOV segments pointed to a memory
outside its LMR.
DAT_INVALID_HANDLE The ep_handle parameter is invalid.
DAT_INVALID_STATE A parameter is in an invalid state. Endpoint was not in the DAT_EP_STATE_CON<hy>
NECTED or DAT_EP_STATE_DISCONNECTED state.
DAT_PROTECTION_VIOLATION Protection violation for local or remote memory access. Protection Zone mis<hy>
match between an LMR of one of the local_iov segments and the local Endpoint.
DAT_PRIVILEGES_VIOLATION Privileges violation for local or remote memory access. One of the LMRs used
in local_iov was either invalid or did not have the local read privileges.
For best Send operation performance, the Consumer should align each buffer segment of local_iov to the Optimal
Buffer Alignment attribute of the Provider. For portable applications, the Consumer should align each buffer seg<hy>
ment of local_iov to the DAT_OPTIMAL_ALIGNMENT.
