devreserv <-> reserve devices for exclusive use
devreserv [key [device-list]...]
devreserv reserves devices for exclusive use. When the device is no longer required, use devfree to release it.
devreserv reserves at most one device per device-list. Each list is searched in linear order until the first available de<hy>
vice is found. If a device cannot be reserved from each list, the entire reservation fails.
When devreserv is invoked without arguments, it lists the devices that are currently reserved and shows to which
key it was reserved. When devreserv is invoked with only the key argument, it lists the devices that are currently
reserved to that key.
The following operands are supported:
device-list Defines a list of devices that devreserv will search to find an available device. The list must be formatted
as a single argument to the shell.
key Designates a unique key on which the device will be reserved. The key must be a positive integer.
Example 1 Reserving a Floppy Disk and a Cartridge Tape
The following example reserves a floppy disk and a cartridge tape:
 $ key=$$
 $ echo "The current Process ID is equal to: $key"
  The Current Process ID is equal to: 10658
 $ devreserv $key diskette1 ctape1
Example 2 Listing All Devices Currently Reserved
The following example lists all devices currently reserved:
 $ devreserv
  disk1 2423
  diskette1 10658
  ctape1 10658
Example 3 Listing All Devices Currently Reserved to a Particular Key
The following example lists all devices currently reserved to a particular key:
 $ devreserv $key
  diskette1
  ctape1
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
1 Command syntax was incorrect, an invalid was option used, or an internal error occurred.

The commands devreserv and devfree are used to manage the availability of devices on a system. Their use is on a
participatory basis and they do not place any constraints on the actual access to the device. They serve as a central<hy>
ized bookkeeping point for those who wish to use them. Devices which have been reserved cannot be used by pro<hy>
cesses which utilize the device reservation functions until the reservation has been canceled. However, processes that
do not use device reservation may use a device that has been reserved since such a process would not have checked
for its reservation status.
