The named utility is a Domain Name System (DNS) server, part of the BIND 9 distribution from ISC. For more in<hy>
formation on the DNS, see RFCs 1033, 1034, and 1035.
When invoked without arguments, named reads the default configuration file /etc/named.conf, reads any initial da<hy>
ta, and listens for queries.
in.named is a link to named.
The following options are supported:
-4
Use only IPv4 transport. By default, both IPv4 and IPv6 transports can be used. Options -4 and -6 are mutually ex<hy>
clusive.
-6
Use only IPv6 transport. By default, both IPv4 and IPv6 transports can be used. Options -4 and -6 are mutually ex<hy>
clusive.
-c config-file
Use config-file as the configuration file instead of the default /etc/named.conf. To ensure that reloading the configu<hy>
ration file continues to work after the server has changed its working directory due to to a possible directory option
in the configuration file, config-file should be an absolute pathname.
-d debug-level
Set the daemon's debug level to debug-level. Debugging traces from named become more verbose as the debug lev<hy>
el increases.
-f
Run the server in the foreground (that is, do not daemonize).
-g
Run the server in the foreground and force all logging to stderr.
-m flag
Turn on memory usage debugging flags. Possible flags are "usage", "trace", and "record". These correspond to the
ISC_MEM_DEBUGXXXX flags.
-n #cpus
Create #cpus worker threads to take advantage of multiple CPUs. If not specified, named will try to determine the
number of CPUs present and create one thread per CPU. If it is unable to determine the number of CPUs, a single
worker thread will be created.
-p port
Listen for queries on port port. If not specified, the default is port 53.
<beginning of page>
-s
Write memory usage statistics to stdout on exit.
This option is mainly of interest to BIND 9 developers and might be removed or changed in a future release.
-t directory
Change the root directory using chroot(2) to directory after processing the command line arguments, but before
reading the configuration file.
This option should be used in conjunction with the -u option, as chrooting a process running as root doesn't enhance
security on most systems; the way chroot() is defined allows a process with root privileges to escape a chroot jail.
-u user
Set the real user ID using setuid(2) to user after completing privileged operations, such as creating sockets that lis<hy>
ten on privileged ports.
On Linux, named uses the kernel's capability mechanism to drop all root privileges except the ability to use
bind(3SOCKET) to bind to a privileged port and set process resource limits. Unfortunately, this means that the -u
option works only when named is run on kernel 2.2.18 or later, or kernel 2.3.99-pre3 or later, since previous kernels
did not allow privileges to be retained after setuid().
-v
Report the version number and exit.
-x cache-file
Load data from cache-file into the cache of the default view.
This option must not be used. It is of interest only to BIND 9 developers and might be removed or changed in a fu<hy>
ture release.
This section describes additional attributes of named.
When starting named from the service management facility, smf(5), named configuration is read from the service
configuration repository. Use svcprop(1) to list the properties and svccfg(1M) to make changes.
The following application configuration properties are available to administrators:
options/server
Specifies the server executable to be used instead of the default server, /usr/sbin/named.
options/configuration_file
Specifies the configuration file to be used instead of the default, /etc/named.conf. A directory option might be speci<hy>
fied in the configuration file. To ensure that reloading the configuration file continues to work in such a situation,
configuration_file should be specified as an absolute pathname. This pathname should not include the chroot_dir
pathname. This property is the equivalent of the -c option.
options/ip_interfaces
Specifies over which IP transport, IPv4 or IPv6, BIND will transmit. Possible values are IPv4 or IPv6. Any other
setting assumes all, the default. This property is the equivalent of command line option -4 or -6
options/listen_on_port
Specifies the default UDP and TCP port to be used for listening to DNS requests. This property is the equivalent of
the command line option -p port.
<beginning of page>
options/debug_level
Specifies the default debug level. The default is 0, which means no debugging. The higher the number the more ver<hy>
bose debug information becomes. Equivalent of the command line option -d debug_level.
options/threads
Specifies the number of CPU worker threads to create. The default of 0 causes named to try and determine the num<hy>
ber of CPUs present and create one thread per CPU. Equivalent of command line option -n #cpus.
options/chroot_dir
Specifies the directory to be used as the root directory after processing SMF properties and the command line argu<hy>
ments but before reading the configuration file. Use this property when using a chroot(2) environment. Synonymous
to command line option -t pathname.
When using chroot(2), named is unable to disable itself when receiving rndc(1M) stop or halt commands. Instead,
you must use the svcadm(1M) disable command.
In the event of a configuration error originating in one of the above SMF application options, named displays a mes<hy>
sage providing information about the error and the parameters that need correcting. The process then exits with exit
code SMF_EXIT_ERR_CONFIG.
At startup, in the event of an error other than a configuration error, named exits with exit code SMF_EX<hy>
IT_ERR_FATAL. Both of this code and SMF_EXIT_ERR_CONFIG cause the start method, smf_method(5), to
place the service in the maintenance state, which can be observed with the svcs(1) command svcs -x.
In addition to the properties listed above, the following property can be used to invoke named as a user other than
root:
start/user
Specifies the identity of the user that is invoking named. See smf_method(5) and chroot(2). Note that the user must
have solaris.smf.manage.bind authorization. Without this role the named will be unable to manage its SMF FMRI
and named will automatically be restarted by the SMF after an rndc(1M) stop or halt command. See EXAMPLES
for a sequence of commands that establishes the correct authorization.
In routine operation, signals should not be used to control the nameserver; rndc(1M) should be used instead.
SIGHUP
Force a reload of the server.
SIGINT, SIGTERM
Shut down the server.
The result of sending any other signals to the server is undefined.
The named configuration file is too complex to describe in detail here. A list of configuration options is provided in
the named.conf man page shipped with the BIND 9 distribution. A complete description is provided in the BIND 9
Administrator Reference Manual. See SEE ALSO. Example 1 Configuring named to Transmit Only over IPv4
Networks
The following command sequence configures named such that it will transmit only over IPv4 networks.
 # svccfg -s svc:network/dns/server:default setprop \
 > options/ip_interfaces=IPv4
 # svcadm refresh svc:network/dns/server:default
 #
<beginning of page>
Example 2 Listing Current Configuration File and Setting an Alternative File
The following sequence of commands lists the current named configuration file and sets an alternative file.
 # svcprop -p options/configuration_file dns/server:default
 /etc/named.conf
 # svccfg -s dns/server:default setprop \
 > options/configuration_file=/var/named/named.conf
 # svcadm refresh dns/server:default
 # svcprop -p options/configuration_file dns/server:default
 /var/named/named.conf
Example 3 Establishing Appropriate Authorization for named
To have named start with the solaris.smf.manage.bind authorization, perform the steps shown below.
Add the user dnsadmin to the solaris.smf.manage.bind role:
 # usermod -A solaris.smf.manage.bind dnsadmin
 Observe effect of command:
 # tail -1 /etc/user_attr
 dnsadmin::::type=normal;auths=solaris.smf.manage.bind
Modify the service properties:
 # svccfg
 svc:> select svc:/network/dns/server:default
 svc:/network/dns/server:default> setprop start/user = dnsadmin
 svc:/network/dns/server:default> setprop start/group = dnsadmin
 svc:/network/dns/server:default> exit
 # svcadm refresh svc:/network/dns/server:default
 # svcadm restart svc:/network/dns/server:default
Because only root has write access to create the default process-ID file, /var/run/named.pid, named must be con<hy>
figured to use an alternative path for the user dnsadmin. Here is an example of how to accomplish this:
 # mkdir /var/named/tmp
 # chown dnsadmin /var/named/tmp
Shown below is what you must add to named.conf to make use of the directory created above.
 # head /etc/named.conf
 options {
 directory "/var/named";
 pid-file "/var/named/tmp/named.pid";
 };
/etc/named.conf

By default, named attempts to contact remote name servers by either their IPv4 or IPv6 address, even though the
host system does not have either IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity (that is, a configured and active interface). To address this
issue, either provide the missing connectivity or use the relevant -4 or -6 command line option. When using svc<hy>
cfg(1M), set application property options/ip_interfaces to either IPv4 or IPv6.
