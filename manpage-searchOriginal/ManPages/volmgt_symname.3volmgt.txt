This function is obsolete. The management of removable media by the Volume Management feature, including vold,
has been replaced by software that supports the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). Programmatic support for HAL
is through the HAL APIs, which are documented on the HAL web site. See hal(5). The return value of this function
is undefined.
These two routines compliment each other, translating between Volume Management's symbolic name for a device,
called a symname, and the /dev pathname for that same device.
volmgt_symname() converts a supplied /dev pathname to a symname, Volume Management's idea of that device's
symbolic name.
volmgt_symdev() does the opposite conversion, converting between a symname, Volume Management's idea of a
device's symbolic name for a volume, to the /dev pathname for that device.
The return from this function is undefined.
volmgt_symname() can fail, returning a null string pointer, if a stat(2) of the supplied pathname fails, or if an
open(2) of /dev/volctl fails, or if any of the following is true:
ENXIO Volume Management is not running.
EINTR An interrupt signal was detected while trying to convert the supplied pathname to a symname.
volmgt_symdev() can fail if an open(2) of /dev/volctl fails, or if any of the following is true:
ENXIO Volume Management is not running.
EINTR An interrupt signal was detected while trying to convert the supplied symname to a /dev pathname.
Example 1 Testing Floppies
The following tests how many floppies Volume Management currently sees in floppy drives (up to 10):
 for (i=0; i < 10; i++) {
  (void) sprintf(path, "floppy%d", i);
  if (volmgt_symdev(path) != NULL) {
  (void) printf("volume %s is in drive %d\n",
  path, i);
  }
 }
Example 2 Finding The Symbolic Name
This code finds out what symbolic name (if any) Volume Management has for /dev/rdsk/c0t6d0s2:
 if ((nm = volmgt_symname("/dev/rdsk/c0t6d0s2")) == NULL) {
  (void) printf("path not managed\n");
 } else {
  (void) printf("path managed as %s\n", nm);
 }
