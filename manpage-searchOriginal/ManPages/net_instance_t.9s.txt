net_instance_t <-> packet event structure passed through to hooks
#include <sys/neti.h>
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
The net_instance_t data structure defines a collection of instances to be called when relevant events happen within
IP. The value returned by the nin_create() function is stored internally and passed back to both the nin_destroy()
and nin_shutdown() functions as the second argument. The netid_t passed through to each function can be used to
uniquely identify each instance of IP.
  char *nin_name;
  void *(*nin_create)(const netid_t);
  void (*nin_destroy)(const netid_t, void *);
  void (*nin_shutdown)(const netid_t, void *);
nin_name Name of the owner of the instance.
nin_create Function to be called when a new instance of IP is created.
nin_destroy Function to be called when an instance of IP is being destroyed.
nin_shutdown Function to be called when an instance of IP is being shutdown. nin_shutdown() is called before
nin_destroy() is called.
