int thr_kill(thread_t thread, int sig);
The thr_kill() function sends the sig signal to the thread designated by thread. The thread argument must be a mem<hy>
ber of the same process as the calling thread. The sig argument must be one of the signals listed in sig<hy>
nal.h(3HEAD), with the exception of SIGCANCEL being reserved and off limits to thr_kill(). If sig is 0, a validity
check is done for the existence of the target thread; no signal is sent.
Upon successful completion, thr_kill() returns 0. Otherwise, an error number is returned. In the event of failure, no
signal is sent.
The thr_kill() function will fail if:
EINVAL The sig argument value is not zero and is an invalid or an unsupported signal number.
ESRCH No thread was found that corresponded to the thread designated by thread ID.
