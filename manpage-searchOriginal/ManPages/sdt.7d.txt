sdt <-> DTrace statically defined tracing provider
The sdt driver is a DTrace dynamic tracing provider that performs dynamic instrumentation at statically-defined lo<hy>
cations in the Solaris kernel.
The sdt provider allows kernel developers to explicitly create probes at formally designated locations in the operat<hy>
ing system kernel and loadable modules, allowing the implementor to consciously choose the points in their code
that are desired probe points, and to convey some semantic knowledge about that point with the choice of probe
name and a relevant set of arguments.
The sdt driver is not a public interface and you access instrumentation offered by this provider through DTrace. Re<hy>
fer to the Solaris Dynamic Tracing Guide for a description of the public documented interfaces available for the
DTrace facility and the probes offered by the sdt provider.
