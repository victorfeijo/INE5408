filesystem <-> File system organization
/
/usr
The file system tree is organized for administrative convenience. Distinct areas within the file system tree are provid<hy>
ed for files that are private to one machine, files that can be shared by multiple machines of a common platform, files
that can be shared by all machines, and home directories. This organization allows sharable files to be stored on one
machine but accessed by many machines using a remote file access mechanism such as NFS. Grouping together
similar files makes the file system tree easier to upgrade and manage.
The file system tree consists of a root file system and a collection of mountable file systems. The mount(2) program
attaches mountable file systems to the file system tree at mount points (directory entries) in the root file system or
other previously mounted file systems. Two file systems, / (the root) and /usr, must be mounted and /var must be ac<hy>
cessible to have a functional system. The root file system is mounted automatically by the kernel at boot time; the
/usr file system is mounted by the system start-up script, which is run as part of the booting process. /var can be
mounted as its own file system or be part of /usr, as it is by default.
Certain locations, noted below, are approved installation locations for bundled Foundation Solaris software. In some
cases, the approved locations for bundled software are also approved locations for add-on system software or for ap<hy>
plications. The following descriptions make clear where the two locations differ. For example, /etc is the installation
location for platform-dependent configuration files that are bundled with Solaris software. The analogous location
for applications is /etc/opt/packagename.
In the following descriptions, subsystem is a category of application or system software, such as a window system
(dt) or a language (java1.2)
The following descriptions make use of the terms platform, platform-dependent, platform-independent, and
platform-specific. Platform refers to a machines Instruction Set Architecture or processor type, such as is returned
by uname -i. Platform-dependent refers to a file that is installed on all platforms and whose contents vary depend<hy>
ing on the platform. Like a platform-dependent file, a platform-independent file is installed on all platforms. How<hy>
ever, the contents of the latter type remains the same on all platforms. An example of a platform-dependent file is
compiled, executable program. An example of a platform-independent file is a standard configuration file, such as
/etc/hosts. Unlike a platform-dependent or a platform-independent file, the platform-specific file is installed only on
a subset of supported platforms. Most platform-specific files are gathered under /platform and /usr/platform.
In the following file or directory descriptions, GNOME stands for GNU Network Object Model Environment. The
GNOME Desktop is shipped with the Solaris operating system.

ting the clean_vartmp property value of the rmtmpfiles service. This is done with the following commands:
 # svccfg -s svc:/system/rmtmpfiles setprop \

Because it is desirable to keep the root file system small and not volatile, on disk-based systems larger file systems
are often mounted on /home, /opt, /usr, and /var.
The file system mounted on /usr contains platform-dependent and platform-independent sharable files. The subtree
rooted at /usr/share contains platform-independent sharable files; the rest of the /usr tree contains platform-depen<hy>
dent files. By mounting a common remote file system, a group of machines with a common platform may share a
single /usr file system. A single /usr/share file system can be shared by machines of any platform. A machine acting
as a file server can share many different /usr file systems to support several different architectures and operating sys<hy>
tem releases. Clients usually mount /usr read-only so that they do not accidentally change any shared files.
The /usr file system contains the following subdirectories:
/usr/4lib
a.out libraries for the Binary Compatibility Package.

laris operating system. If needed for storing machine-local add-on software, create the directory /opt/local and make
/usr/local a symbolic link to /opt/local. The /opt directory or filesystem is for storing add-on software to the system.

rectories, one per supported platform. The semantics of the series of directories is equivalent to /platform, except for
subdirectories which do not provide utility under one or the other (for example, /platform/include is not needed).
/usr/platform/`uname -i`/include
Symbolic link to /../`uname -i`/include. Platform-specific system (sys, vm) header files with semantics equivalent to
/usr/include. An approved installation location for bundled Solaris software and for add-on system software.

Solaris software and for add-on system software.

cation for bundled Solaris software and for add-on system software.
