ucontext.h, ucontext <-> user context
#include <ucontext.h>
The <ucontext.h> header defines the ucontext_t type as a structure that includes at least the following members:
 ucontext_t uc_link
 sigset_t uc_sigmask
 stack_t uc_stack
 mcontext_t uc_mcontext
The uc_link member is a pointer to the context that to be resumed when this context returns. If uc_link is equal to 0,
this context is the main context and the process exits when this context returns.
The uc_sigmask member defines the set of signals that are blocked when this context is active. See sigprocmask(2).
The uc_stack member defines the stack used by this context. See sigaltstack(2).
The uc_mcontext member contains the saved set of machine registers and any implementation-specific context data.
Portable applications should not modify or access uc_mcontext.
