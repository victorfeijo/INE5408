sysidtool is a suite of programs that configure a new system, or one that has been unconfigured with sys-uncon<hy>
fig(1M). The sysidtool programs run automatically at system installation, or during the first boot after a machine has
been successfully unconfigured.
These programs have no effect except at such times, and should never be run manually.
The sysidtool programs set up the appropriate information in the machine's configuration files, in the kernel, and on
the machine's network interface. The following list shows the available commands and the information for which
each of the commands lists.
sysidnet: network configuration
Machine's default locale. Machine's console type. Machine's host name. Machine's IP address.
sysidns: name service configuration
Name service choice: NIS, NIS+, DNS, LDAP, or none. Machine's IP subnet mask (if no NIS/NIS+ server can auto<hy>
matically be located on the machine's sub-network. Domain name for chosen name service. Hostname and IP ad<hy>
dress of name server(s). DNS search list (DNS name service only)
sysidsys: miscellaneous system configuration
Machine's IP subnet mask (if an NIS/NIS+ server was automatically located on the machine's sub-network). Ma<hy>
chine's time zone. Date and time.
sysidroot: control superuser information
Machine's root password.
sysidpm: power management configuration
Auto-shutdown confirmation if the system is Energystar-V2 compliant, that is, a new system model shipped after
October 1, 1995.
sysidnfs4: NFSv4 domain configuration
Domain name to be used by NFSv4 client(s) and server(s) to transmit user and group id's as strings of the general
form "[user|group]@domain".
sysidkbd: keyboard layout configuration
The corresponding keytable is loaded into the kernel according to the configured keyboard layout.
sysidconfig: host- or platform-specific configuration
This command controls specification and execution of custom configuration applications that can be specified for a
particular host or a particular platform. See sysidconfig(1M).

The sysidtool programs attempt to obtain system configuration information from various name service databases, for
example, NIS, or from the sysidcfg(4) file, and you are prompted to provide the information if it cannot be found.
However, you can avoid one or more of the prompts by preconfiguring the appropriate configuration information in
the name service databases or in the sysidcfg(4) file.
To preconfigure the information in the name service databases, you must use the name service commands or the Sol<hy>
stice AdminSuite tools. See for more details about how to preconfigure the system configuration information.
The machine's configuration information is set up in its /etc and /var files.
If a system has more than one network interface, you can use sysidtool to configure all interfaces on the system.
You cannot use the name service databases or the sysidcfg(4) file to suppress the Power Management configuration
prompt. However, you can suppress it by creating either the /autoshutdown or /noautoshutdown file before instal<hy>
lation reboot. Accordingly, the auto-shutdown feature is silently configured. The /autoshutdown or /noautoshut<hy>
down files are removed by sysidpm before it exits.
sysidnfs4 installs the /etc/.NFS4inst_state.domain file upon the successful configuration of the NFSv4 domain
name. If this file is present during system reboot, the sysidnfs4 program is run but no prompts are displayed. The
suppression of prompts is intended for system upgrades, in which a system configuration typically stays unchanged.

sysidkbd prompts for the keyboards with zero-bCountryCode and then sets the keyboard layout string in the
/etc/default/kbd file. If the sysidkbd gets the valid keyboard layout string, the string will be set into the entry "LAY<hy>
OUT=" in the file.

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris Operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
NIS+ to LDAP are available in the current Solaris release. For more information, visit http://www.sun.com/directo<hy>
