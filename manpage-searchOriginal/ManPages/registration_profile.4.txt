registration.profile
The registration profile is a template for the information provided for Basic Registration. The information in this
template is consumed by the sconadm(1M) utility. sconadm is the command-line alternative to the Basic Registra<hy>
tion GUI.
An example of the registration profile template is provided in /usr/lib/breg/data/RegistrationProfile.properties.
This file is owned by root, with read-only permissions. As root, you can copy the file to a location of your choosing
and edit the file.
The registration profile template contains the following properties:
 userName=
 password=

Values are not required for every property. The filling in or leaving blank a property depends on the task you intend
