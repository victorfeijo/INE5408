iwi <-> Intel Pro. Wireless 802.11a/b/g IPW2200B/G IPW2915A/B/G Driver
The iwi 802.11b/g wireless NIC driver is a multi-threaded, loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based STREAMS driver
supporting the Data Link Provider Interface, dlpi(7P), on Intel Pro Wireless 2200BG 2915ABG chipset-based wire<hy>
less NIC's. Driver functions include controller initialization, wireless 802.11b infrastructure network connection,
WEP and frame transmit and receive.
The iwi driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rate and mode. Supported 802.11b data rates are 1, 2,
5.5 and 11 Mbits/sec. Supported 802.11g data rates are 1, 2, 5.5, 11, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 54 Mbits/sec.
The iwi driver supports only BSS networks (also known as "ap" or "infrastructure" networks) and "open"(or "open-
system") or "shared system" authentication. Only WEP encryption is currently supported. You perform configuration
and administration tasks using the dladm(1M) and wificonfig(1M) utilities.
/dev/iwi* Special character device.
/kernel/drv/iwi 32-bit ELF kernel module (x86).
/kernel/drv/amd64/iwi 64-bit ELF kernel module (x86).
