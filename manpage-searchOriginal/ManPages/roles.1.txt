roles <-> print roles granted to a user
roles [ user ]...
The command roles prints on standard output the roles that you or the optionally-specified user have been granted.
Roles are special accounts that correspond to a functional responsibility rather than to an actual person (referred to
as a normal user).
Each user may have zero or more roles. Roles have most of the attributes of normal users and are identified like nor<hy>
mal users in passwd(4) and shadow(4). Each role must have an entry in the user_attr(4) file that identifies it as a
role. Roles can have their own authorizations and profiles. See auths(1) and profiles(1).
Roles are not allowed to log into a system as a primary user. Instead, a user must log in as him<em> or herself and as<hy>
sume the role. The actions of a role are attributable to the normal user. When auditing is enabled, the audited events
of the role contain the audit ID of the original user who assumed the role.
A role may not assume itself or any other role. Roles are not hierarchical. However, rights profiles (see prof_attr(4))
are hierarchical and can be used to achieve the same effect as hierarchical roles.
Roles must have valid passwords and one of the shells that interprets profiles: either pfcsh, pfksh, or pfsh. See pfex<hy>
ec(1).
Role assumption may be performed using su(1M), rlogin(1), or some other service that supports the PAM_RUSER
variable. Successful assumption requires knowledge of the role's password and membership in the role. Role assign<hy>
ments are specified in user_attr(4). Example 1 Sample output
