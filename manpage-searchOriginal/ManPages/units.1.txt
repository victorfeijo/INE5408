units
units converts quantities expressed in various standard scales to their equivalents in other scales. It works interac<hy>
tively in this fashion:
 You have:~~inch
 You want:~~cm
  * 2.540000e+00
 / 3.937008e<mi>01
A quantity is specified as a multiplicative combination of units optionally preceded by a numeric multiplier. Powers
are indicated by suffixed positive integers, division by the usual sign:
 You have:~~15 lbs force/in2
 You want:~~atm
  * 1.020689e+00
  / 9.797299e<mi>01
units only does multiplicative scale changes; thus it can convert Kelvin to Rankine, but not Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Most familiar units, abbreviations, and metric prefixes are recognized, together with a generous leavening of exotica
and a few constants of nature including:
pi ratio of circumference to diameter,
c speed of light,
e charge on an electron,
g acceleration of gravity,
force same as g,
mole Avogadro's number,
water pressure head per unit height of water,
au astronomical unit.
Pound is not recognized as a unit of mass; lb is. Compound names are run together, (for example, lightyear).
British units that differ from their U.S. counterparts are prefixed thus: brgallon. For a complete list of units, type:
