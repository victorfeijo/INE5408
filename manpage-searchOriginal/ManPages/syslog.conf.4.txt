syslog.conf <-> configuration file for syslogd system log daemon
/etc/syslog.conf
The file /etc/syslog.conf contains information used by the system log daemon, syslogd(1M), to forward a system
message to appropriate log files and/or users. syslogd preprocesses this file through m4(1) to obtain the correct in<hy>
formation for certain log files, defining LOGHOST if the address of "loghost" is the same as one of the addresses of
the host that is running syslogd.
A configuration entry is composed of two TAB-separated fields:
 selector  action
The selector field contains a semicolon-separated list of priority specifications of the form:
 facility.level [ ; facility.level ]
where facility is a system facility, or comma-separated list of facilities, and level is an indication of the severity of
the condition being logged. Recognized values for facility include:
user Messages generated by user processes. This is the default priority for messages from programs or facilities not
listed in this file.
kern Messages generated by the kernel.
mail The mail system.
daemon System daemons, such as in.ftpd(1M)
auth The authorization system: login(1), su(1M), getty(1M), among others.
lpr The line printer spooling system: lpr(1B), lpc(1B), among others.
news Designated for the USENET network news system.
uucp Designated for the UUCP system; it does not currently use the syslog mechanism.
cron Designated for cron/at messages generated by systems that do logging through syslog. The current version of
the Solaris Operating Environment does not use this facility for logging.
audit Designated for audit messages generated by systems that audit by means of syslog.
local0-7 Designated for local use.
mark For timestamp messages produced internally by syslogd.
* An asterisk indicates all facilities except for the mark facility.
Recognized values for level are (in descending order of severity):
<beginning of page>
emerg For panic conditions that would normally be broadcast to all users.
alert For conditions that should be corrected immediately, such as a corrupted system database.
crit For warnings about critical conditions, such as hard device errors.
err For other errors.
warning For warning messages.
notice For conditions that are not error conditions, but may require special handling. A configuration entry with a
level value of notice must appear on a separate line.
info Informational messages.
debug For messages that are normally used only when debugging a program.
none Do not send messages from the indicated facility to the selected file. For example, a selector of
*.debug;mail.none
sends all messages except mail messages to the selected file.
For a given facility and level, syslogd matches all messages for that level and all higher levels. For example, an entry
that specifies a level of crit also logs messages at the alert and emerg levels.
The action field indicates where to forward the message. Values for this field can have one of four forms: <bu> A file<hy>
name, beginning with a leading slash, which indicates that messages specified by the selector are to be written to the
specified file. The file is opened in append mode if it exists. If the file does not exist, logging silently fails for this ac<hy>
tion. <bu> The name of a remote host, prefixed with an @, as with: @server, which indicates that messages specified by
the selector are to be forwarded to the syslogd on the named host. The hostname "loghost" is treated, in the default
syslog.conf, as the hostname given to the machine that logs syslogd messages. Every machine is "loghost" by de<hy>
fault, per the hosts database. It is also possible to specify one machine on a network to be "loghost" by, literally,
naming the machine "loghost". If the local machine is designated to be "loghost", then syslogd messages are written
to the appropriate files. Otherwise, they are sent to the machine "loghost" on the network. <bu> A comma-separated list
of usernames, which indicates that messages specified by the selector are to be written to the named users if they are
logged in. <bu> An asterisk, which indicates that messages specified by the selector are to be written to all logged-in
users.
Blank lines are ignored. Lines for which the first nonwhite character is a '#' are treated as comments. Example 1 A
Sample Configuration File
With the following configuration file:
tab(); lw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) *.notice/var/log/notice mail.info/var/log/notice *.crit/var/log/critical
kern,mark.debug/dev/console kern.err@server *.emerg* *.alertroot,operator *.alert;auth.warn<hy>
ing/var/log/auth
syslogd(1M) logs all mail system messages except debug messages and all notice (or higher) messages into a file
named /var/log/notice. It logs all critical messages into /var/log/critical, and all kernel messages and 20-minute
marks onto the system console.
<beginning of page>
Kernel messages of err (error) severity or higher are forwarded to the machine named server. Emergency messages
are forwarded to all users. The users root and operator are informed of any alert messages. All messages from the
authorization system of warning level or higher are logged in the file /var/log/auth.
