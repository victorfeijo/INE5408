mmsexplorer <-> generate diagnostic report for Media Management System
mmsexplorer -u [report_name] [num_lines]
The mmsexplorer command creates a diagnostic report of the activities of the Media Managment System (MMS)
server configuration and collects log information. It constructs the diagnostic report from the most recent entries in
the MMS log file, MMS database, and MMS trace file.
The MMS is a software interface, consisting of library managers and drive managers, that manages storage re<hy>
sources such as tape libraries, tape drives, media pools, tape volumes, and the disk resources that emulate tape drives
and tape volumes.
By default, mmsexplorer generates a compressed report. Use the -u option to generate an uncompressed file.
To run mmsexplorer, you must become superuser, or assume the Primary Administrator role.
The following options are supported:
-u
Generates the diagnostic report file in an uncompressed format.
report_name
Specifies the name of the diagnostic report file. The default name and location is:
 /tmp/MMSreport.<hostname.YYYYMMDD.HHMMZ>.tar.gz
num_lines
Specifies the number of lines to capture from each file that contributes to the diagnostic report. The default is 1000
lines.
Example 1 Creating Diagnostic Report Using Default Values
The following command creates a diagnostic report using all default values. The MMS server is running on a host
named x400. This name is reflected in the name of the diagnostic file.
 # mmsexplorer
 Report name: /tmp/MMSreport.x4200.20080530.1247CDT.tar.gz
 Lines per file: 1000
 Output format: tar.gz (default) Use -u for unarchived/uncompressed.
