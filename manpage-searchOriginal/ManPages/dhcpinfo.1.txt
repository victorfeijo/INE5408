dhcpinfo <-> display values of parameters received through DHCP
dhcpinfo [-c] [-i interface] [-n limit] [-v 4|6] code
dhcpinfo [-c] [-i interface] [-n limit] [-v 4|6] identifier
The dhcpinfo utility prints the DHCP-supplied value(s) of the parameter requested on the command line. The pa<hy>
rameter can be identified either by its numeric code in the DHCP specification, or by its mnemonic identifier, as list<hy>
ed in dhcp_inittab(4). This command is intended to be used in command substitutions in the shell scripts invoked
by init(1M) at system boot. It first contacts the DHCP client daemon at system boot or in event scripts as described
in dhcpagent(1M). It first contacts the DHCP client daemon dhcpagent(1M) to verify that DHCP has successfully
completed on the requested interface. If DHCP has successfully completed on the requested interface, dhcpinfo re<hy>
trieves the values for the requested parameter. Parameter values echoed by dhcpinfo should not be used without
checking its exit status. See exit(1).
See dhcp_inittab(4) for the list of mnemonic identifier codes for all DHCP parameters. See RFC 2132, DHCP Op<hy>
tions and BOOTP Vendor Extensions for more details on DHCPv4 parameters, and RFC 3315, Dynamic Host Con<hy>
figuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6), for more details on DHCPv6 parameters.
The output from dhcpinfo consists of one or more lines of ASCII text; the format of the output depends upon the re<hy>
quested parameter. The number of values returned per line and the total number of lines output for a given parameter
are determined by the parameter's granularity and maximum values, respectively, as defined by dhcp_inittab(4).
The format of each individual value is determined by the data type of the option, as determined by dhcp_inittab(4).
The possible data types and their formats are listed below:

The following options are supported:
-c Displays the output in a canonical format. This format is identical to the OCTET format with a granularity of 1.
-i interface Specifies the interface to retrieve values for DHCP parameters from. If this option is not specified, the
primary interface is used.
If a primary interface has not been selected for the system by ifconfig(1M) or for this command by -i, the system au<hy>
tomatically selects an interface to consider as primary for the current command invocation. The selection chooses
the interface whose name sorts lexically first, and that has DHCP parameters attached. This selection does not affect
system state. Use ifconfig(1M) to set a primary interface.
The recommended practice in the dhcpagent(1M) eventhook scripts is to specify the desired interface with -i, rather
than relying on primary selection.
For DHCPv6, the interface name used should be the name of the physical interface, not one of the logical interfaces
created by dhcpagent.
-n limit Limits the list of values displayed to limit lines.
-v4 | 6 Specifies the DHCP version to query. Use -v4for DHCPv4 and -v6 for DHCPv6.
The following operands are supported:
<beginning of page>
code Numeric code for the requested DHCP parameter, as defined by the DHCP specification. Vendor options are
specified by adding 256 to the actual vendor code for DHCPv4, and 65536 for DHCPv6.
identifier Mnemonic symbol for the requested DHCP parameter, as listed in dhcp_inittab(4).
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful operation.
2 The operation was not successful. The DHCP client daemon might not be running, the interface might have failed
to configure, or no satisfactory DHCP responses were received.
3 Bad arguments.
4 The operation timed out.
6 System error (should never occur).
