ses <-> SCSI enclosure services device driver
ses@target,lun
The ses device driver is an interface to SCSI enclosure services devices. These devices sense and monitor the physi<hy>
cal conditions in an enclosure as well as allow access to the status reporting and configuration features of the enclo<hy>
sure (such as indicator LEDs on the enclosure.)
ioctl(9E) calls may be issued to ses to determine the state of the enclosure and to set parameters on the enclosure
services device.
No ses driver properties are defined. Use the ses.conf file to configure the ses driver. Example 1 ses.conf File For<hy>

The SES driver currently supports the SES, SAFTE and SEN enclosure service chipsets. SEN and SAFTE protocols
are translated internally in the driver into SES compliant data structures. This enables the SES driver to work seam<hy>
lessly with different protocols and eliminates the need to enhance user applications.
SESIOC_GETNOBJ Returns an unsigned integer that represents the number of SES data structures in the enclo<hy>
sure services chip.
SESIOC_GETOBJMAP Returns a size array containing ses_object elements communicated through
SESIOC_GETNOBJ(). ses_object is defined in sesio.h.
SESIOC_INIT Instructs the device to perform a self-diagnostic test. Currently SES & SEN devices always return
success.
SESIOC_GETENCSTAT Returns an unsigned character that represents status enclosure as defined by Table 25 in
Section 7.1.2 of the SES specification NCITS 305-199x.
SESIOC_GETOBJSTAT This ioctl is passed an ses_objarg containing the obj_id you want to set, then fills in the
remaining fields according to element status page of the SES specification.
SESIOC_SETOBJSTAT Sets options in the control field. You set control field options by filling out all fields in
ses_objarg. Field definitions are presented in Section 7.2.2 of the SES specification.
