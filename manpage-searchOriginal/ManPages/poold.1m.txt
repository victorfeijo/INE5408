poold <-> automated resource pools partitioning daemon
poold [-l level]
poold provides automated resource partitioning facilities. poold can be enabled or disabled using the Solaris Service
Management Facility, smf(5). poold requires the Resource Pools facility to be active in order to operate.
The dynamic resource pools service's fault management resource identifier (FMRI) is:
 svc:/system/pools/dynamic
The resource pools service's FMRI is:
 svc:/system/pools
poold's configuration details are held in a libpool(3LIB) configuration and you can access all customizable behavior
from this configuration.
poold periodically examines the load on the system and decides whether intervention is required to maintain optimal
system performance with respect to resource consumption. poold also responds to externally initiated (with respect
to poold) changes of either resource configuration or objectives.
If intervention is required, poold attempts to reallocate the available resources to ensure that performance objectives
are satisfied. If it is not possible for poold to meet performance objectives with the available resources, then a mes<hy>
sage is written to the log. poold allocates scarce resources according to the objectives configured by the administra<hy>
tor. The system administrator must determine which resource pools are most deserving of scarce resource and indi<hy>
cate this through the importance of resource pools and objectives.
The following options are supported:
-l level Specify the vebosity level for logging information.
Specify level as ALERT, CRIT, ERR, WARNING, NOTICE, INFO, and DEBUG. If level is not supplied, then
the default logging level is INFO.
ALERT
 A condition that should be corrected immediately, such as a corrupted system database.
CRIT Critical conditions, such as hard device errors.
ERR Errors.
WARNING Warning messages.
NOTICE
 Conditions that are not error conditions, but that may require special handling.
INFO Informational messages.
DEBUG Messages that contain information normally of use only when debugging a program.
When invoked manually, with the -l option, all log output is directed to standard error. Example 1 Modifying the
Default Logging Level
The following command modifies the default logging level to ERR:
<beginning of page>
 # /usr/lib/pool/poold -l ERR
Example 2 Enabling Dynamic Resource Pools
The following command enables dynamic resource pools:
 # /usr/sbin/svcadm enable svc:/system/pools/dynamic
