pam_unix_account <-> PAM account management module for UNIX
pam_unix_account.so.1
pam_unix_account module implements pam_sm_acct_mgmt(), which provides functionality to the PAM account
management stack. The module provides functions to validate that the user's account is not locked or expired and
that the user's password does not need to be changed. The module retrieves account information from the configured
databases in nsswitch.conf(4).
The following options can be passed to the module:
debug syslog(3C) debugging information at the LOG_DEBUG level
nowarn Turn off warning messages
server_policy If the account authority for the user, as specified by PAM_USER, is a server, do not apply the Unix
policy from the passwd entry in the name service switch.
The following values are returned:
PAM_UNIX_ACCOUNT User account has expired
PAM_AUTHTOK_EXPIRED Password expired and no longer usable
PAM_BUF_ERR Memory buffer error
PAM_IGNORE Ignore module, not participating in result
PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD Obtain new authentication token from the user
PAM_PERM_DENIED The account is locked or has been inactive for too long
PAM_SERVICE_ERR Error in underlying service module
PAM_SUCCESS The account is valid for use at this time
PAM_USER_UNKNOWN No account is present for the user

The interfaces in libpam(3LIB) are MT-Safe only if each thread within the multi-threaded application uses its own
PAM handle.
Attempts to validate locked accounts are logged via syslog(3C) to the LOG_AUTH facility with a LOG_NOTICE
severity.
