int posix_spawnattr_getpgroup(const posix_spawnattr_t *restrict attr,
 pid_t *restrict pgroup);
int posix_spawnattr_setpgroup(posix_spawnattr_t *attr, pid_t pgroup);
The posix_spawnattr_getpgroup() function obtains the value of the spawn-pgroup attribute from the attributes ob<hy>
ject referenced by attr.
The posix_spawnattr_setpgroup() function sets the spawn-pgroup attribute in an initialized attributes object refer<hy>
enced by attr.
The spawn-pgroup attribute represents the process group to be joined by the new process image in a spawn operation
(if POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP is set in the spawn-flags attribute). The default value of this attribute is zero.
Upon successful completion, posix_spawnattr_getpgroup() returns 0 and stores the value of the spawn-pgroup at<hy>
tribute of attr into the object referenced by the pgroup parameter. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate
the error.
Upon successful completion, posix_spawnattr_setpgroup() returns 0. Otherwise, an error number is returned to in<hy>
dicate the error.
These functions may fail if:
EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.
The posix_spawnattr_setpgroup() function may fail if:
EINVAL The value of the attribute being set is not valid.
