The hline_set(), vline_set(), whline_set(), wvline_set() functions draw a line, in either the window stdscr or win
starting at the current cursor position. The line is drawn using the character wch and is a maximum of n positions
long, or as many as will fit into the window. If wch is a null pointer, the default horizontal or vertical character is
used.
The mvhline_set(), mvvline_set(), mvwhline_set(), mvwvline_set() functions are similar to the previous group of
functions but the line begins at cursor position specified by x and y.
The functions with names ending with hline_set() draw horizontal lines proceeding towards the last column of the
same line. The functions with names ending with vline_set() draw vertical lines proceeding towards the last column
of the same line.
These functions do not change the position of the cursor.
wch Is the complex character used to draw the line.
n Is the maximum number of characters in the line.
y Is the y (row) coordinate for the start of the line.
x Is the x (column) coordinate for the start of the line.
win Is a pointer to a window.
On success, these functions return OK. Otherwise, they return ERR.
None.
