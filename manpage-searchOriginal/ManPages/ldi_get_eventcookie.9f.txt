Obsolete
ldi_handle_t lh Layered handle.
char *name null-terminated string containing the event name.
ddi_eventcookie_t *ecp Pointer to the kernel event cookie.
This function is obsolete and is only maintained for compatibility. Use of this function is strongly discouraged. For
equivalent functionality provided by new interfaces, see ldi_ev_get_cookie(9F) and ldi_ev_register_callbacks(9F).
The ldi_get_eventcookie() function queries the device tree for a cookie matching the given event name and returns a
reference to that cookie. The search is performed by calling up the device tree hierarchy of the device represented
by the layered driver handle until the request is satisfied by a bus nexus driver, or the top of the dev_info tree is
reached.
The cookie returned by this function can be used to register a callback handler with ldi_add_event_handler(9F).
DDI_SUCCESS Cookie handle is returned.
DDI_FAILURE Request was not serviceable by any nexus driver in the target device's ancestral device tree hierar<hy>
chy.
This function may be called from user or kernel contexts.
