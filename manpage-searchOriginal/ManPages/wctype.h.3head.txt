wctype.h, wctype <-> wide-character classification and mapping utilities
#include <wctype.h>
The <wctype.h> header defines the following types:
wint_t As described in <wchar.h>.
wctrans_t A scalar type that can hold values that represent locale-specific character mappings.
wctype_t As described in <wchar.h>.
The <wctype.h> header defines the following macro name:
WEOF Constant expression of type wint_t that is returned by several MSE functions to indicate end-of-file.
For all functions described in this header that accept an argument of type wint_t, the value is representable as a
wchar _t or equals the value of WEOF. If this argument has any other value, the behavior is undefined.
The behavior of these functions is affected by the LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.
Inclusion of the <wctype.h> header can make visible all symbols from the headers <ctype.h>, <stdarg.h>, <std<hy>
def.h>, <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h>, <time.h>, and <wchar.h>.
