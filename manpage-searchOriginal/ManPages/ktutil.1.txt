ktutil <-> Kerberos keytab maintenance utility
/usr/bin/ktutil
The ktutil command is an interactive command-line interface utility for managing the keylist in keytab files. You
must read in a keytab's keylist before you can manage it. Also, the user running the ktutil command must have
read/write permissions on the keytab. For example, if a keytab is owned by root, which it typically is, ktutil must be
run as root to have the appropriate permissions.
clear_list
clear Clears the current keylist.
read_kt file
rkt file Reads a keytab into the current keylist. You must specify a keytab file to read.
write_kt file
wkt file Writes the current keylist to a keytab file. You must specify a keytab file to write. If the keytab file already
exists, the current keylist is appended to the existing keytab file.
add_entry number
addent number Adds an entry to the current keylist. Specify the entry by the keylist slot number.
delete_entry number
delent number Deletes an entry from the current keylist. Specify the entry by the keylist slot number.
list
l Lists the current keylist.
list_request
lr Lists available requests (commands).
quit
exit
q Exits utility.
Example 1 Deleting a principal from a file
The following example deletes the host/denver@ACME.com principal from the /etc/krb5/krb5.keytab file. Notice
that if you want to delete an entry from an existing keytab, you must first write the keylist to a temporary keytab and
then overwrite the existing keytab with the temporary keytab. This is because the wkt command actually appends
the current keylist to an existing keytab, so you can't use it to overwrite a keytab.
