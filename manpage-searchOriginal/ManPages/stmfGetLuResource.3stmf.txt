cc [ flag... ] file... -lstmf [ library... ]
#include <libstmf.h>
int stmfGetLuResource(stmfGuid *luGuid, luResource *hdl);
luGuid The guid of logical unit to retrieve.
hdl The logical unit resource to create.
The stmfGetLuResource() function retrieves a logical unit resource hdl for a given logical unit. The luGuid argu<hy>
ment must represent a currently registered stmf logical unit. This retrieved resource is a set of device-specific proper<hy>
ties for a logical unit device. This allocates an luResource hdl of device type matching luGuid. The stmf<hy>
FreeLuResource(3STMF) function should be used when hdl is no longer needed.
The following values are returned:
STMF_STATUS_SUCCESS The API call was successful.
STMF_ERROR_NOT_FOUND The guid does not exist.
