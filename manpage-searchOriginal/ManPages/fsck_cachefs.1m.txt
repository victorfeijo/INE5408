CacheFS problems it finds by default. There is no interactive mode. The most likely invocation of fsck for CacheFS
file systems is at boot time from an entry in the /etc/vfstab file. See vfstab(4).
The following options are supported:
-m Check, but do not repair.
-o noclean Force a check on the cache even if there is no reason to suspect there is a problem.
