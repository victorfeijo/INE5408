rtw <-> RealTek 8180L 802.11b Wireless NIC driver
The rtw 802.11b wireless NIC driver is a multi-threaded, loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based STREAMS driver sup<hy>
porting RealTek 8180L chipset-based NIC's.
The rtw driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rate and mode. Supported 802.11b data rates are 1, 2,
5.5 and 11 Mbits/sec. The default is 11.
The rtw driver supports only BSS networks (also known as "ap" or "infrastructure" networks) and "open"(or
"open-system") or "shared system" authentication.
