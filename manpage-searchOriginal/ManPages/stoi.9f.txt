stoi, numtos <-> convert between an integer and a decimal string
#include <sys/ddi.h>
int stoi(char **str);
void numtos(unsigned long num, char *s);
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
str Pointer to a character string to be converted.
num Decimal number to be converted to a character string.
s Character buffer to hold converted decimal number.
The stoi() function returns the integer value of a string of decimal numeric characters beginning at **str. No over<hy>
flow checking is done. *str is updated to point at the last character examined.
The numtos() function converts a long into a null-terminated character string. No bounds checking is done. The
caller must ensure there is enough space to hold the result.
The stoi() function returns the integer value of the string str.
The stoi() function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context.
Writing Device Drivers
The stoi() function handles only positive integers; it does not handle leading minus signs.
