int pool_error(void);
const char *pool_strerror(int perr);
The pool_error() function returns the error value of the last failure recorded by the invocation of one of the func<hy>
tions of the resource pool configuration library, libpool.
The pool_strerror() function returns a descriptive null-terminated string for each of the valid pool error codes.
The following error codes can be returned by pool_error():
The pool_error() function returns the current pool error value for the calling thread from among the following:
POE_ACCESS The operation could not be performed because the configuration was not opened with the correct

POE_BADPARAM A bad parameter was supplied.
POE_BAD_PROP_TYPE An incorrect property type was submitted or encountered during the pool operation.
POE_DATASTORE An error occurred within permanent storage.
POE_INVALID_CONF The pool configuration presented for the operation is invalid.
POE_INVALID_SEARCH A query whose outcome set was empty was attempted.
POE_NOTSUP An unsupported operation was attempted.
POE_PUTPROP An attempt to write a read-only property was made.
POE_OK The previous pool operation succeeded.
POE_SYSTEM An underlying system call or library function failed; errno(3C) is preserved where possible.
The pool_strerror() function returns a pointer to the string corresponding to the requested error value. If the error
value has no corresponding string, <mi>1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
The pool_strerror() function will fail if:
