in.ndpd <-> daemon for IPv6 autoconfiguration
/usr/lib/inet/in.ndpd [-adt] [-f config_file]
in.ndpd provides both the host and router autoconfiguration components of Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 and State<hy>
less and Stateful Address Autoconfiguration for IPv6. In particular, in.ndpd implements: <bu> router discovery; <bu> prefix
discovery; <bu> parameter discovery; <bu> invocation of stateful address autoconfiguration; <bu> stateless address autoconfigu<hy>
ration; and <bu> privacy extensions for stateless address autoconfiguration.
Other aspects of Neighbor Discovery are implemented by ip6(7P), including: <bu> address resolution; <bu> neighbor un<hy>
reachability detection; and <bu> redirect.
The duplicate address detection function is implemented by the system kernel.
in.ndpd is managed by the service management facility (SMF), by means of the service identifier:
 svc:/network/routing/ndp:default
If the /etc/inet/ndpd.conf file does not exist or does not set the variable AdvSendAdvertisements to true for a net<hy>
work interface, then in.ndpd will make the node a host for that interface, that is, sending router solicitation mes<hy>
sages and then using router advertisement messages it receives to autoconfigure the node. Note that in.ndpd only
autoconfigures the addresses of global or site-local scope from the prefix advertisement.
If AdvSendAdvertisements is set to true for an interface, then in.ndpd will perform router functions on that inter<hy>
face, that is, sending router advertisement messages to autoconfigure the attached hosts, but not use any advertise<hy>
ments it receives for autoconfiguration. However, when sending advertisements, in.ndpd will use the advertisements
it sends itself to autoconfigure its prefixes.
Stateless autoconfiguration requires no manual configuration of hosts, minimal (if any) configuration of routers, and
no additional servers. The stateless mechanism enables a host to generate its own addresses and uses local informa<hy>
tion as well as non-local information that is advertised by routers to generate the addresses. in.ndpd will plumb logi<hy>
cal interfaces for each of these addresses.
Stateful autoconfiguration involves the dhcpagent(1M) daemon and the use of the DHCPv6 protocol. The dhcpa<hy>
gent daemon is responsible for plumbing the logical interfaces for the acquired addresses, maintaining the leases,
and handling duplicate addresses. in.ndpd starts the dhcpagent daemon automatically and signals when DHCPv6
should be started. in.ndpd also detects when dhcpagent configures the logical interfaces, and sets the appropriate
prefix length on each according to received Routing Advertisement messages. in.ndpd will not stop dhcpagent; use
ifconfig(1M) to control dhcpagent if necessary.
Temporary addresses that are autoconfigured for an interface can also be implemented. A temporary address token is
enabled for one or more interfaces on a host. However, unlike standard, autoconfigured IPv6 addresses, a temporary
address consists of the site prefix and a randomly generated 64 bit number. This random number becomes the inter<hy>
face ID segment of the IPv6 address. A link-local address is not generated with the temporary address as the inter<hy>
face ID.
If the kernel detects a duplicate temporary address, in.ndpd will automatically choose another.
Routers advertise all prefixes that have been assigned on the link. IPv6 hosts use Neighbor Discovery to obtain a
subnet prefix from a local router. Hosts automatically create IPv6 addresses by combining the subnet prefix with an
interface IDs that is generated from an interface's MAC address. In the absence of routers, a host can generate only
link-local addresses. Link-local addresses can only be used for communication with nodes on the same link.
For information on how to enable IPv6 address autoconfiguration, see
Supported options and equivalent SMF service properties are listed below. SMF service properties are set using a
command of the form:
 # routeadm -m ndp:default key=value
-a
Turn off stateless and stateful address auto configuration. When set, the daemon does not autoconfigure any address<hy>
<beginning of page>
es and does not renumber any addresses. This option does the same thing as the following lines in ndpd.conf(4):
 ifdefault StatefulAddrConf off
 ifdefault StatelessAddrConf off
Use of this option is equivalent to setting the stateless_addr_conf property to false.
-d
Turn on large amounts of debugging output on stdout. When set, the program runs in the foreground and stays at<hy>
tached to the controlling terminal. Use of this option is equivalent to setting the debug property to true.
-f  config_file
Use config_file for configuration information instead of the default /etc/inet/ndpd.conf. Use of this option is equiv<hy>
alent to setting the config_file property to the configuration file to be used.
-t
Turn on tracing (printing) of all sent and received packets tostdout. When set, the program runs in the foreground
and stays attached to the controlling terminal. As such, this option cannot be run under the SMF.
/etc/inet/ndpd.conf Configuration file. This file is not necessary on a host, but it is required on a router to enable
in.ndpd to advertise autoconfiguration information to the hosts.

Receipt of a SIGHUP signal will make in.ndpd restart and reread /etc/inet/ndpd.conf.
The in.ndpd daemon service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/network/routing/ndp:default
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
