int door_ucred(ucred_t **info);
The door_ucred() function returns credential information associated with the client, if any, of the current door in<hy>
vocation.
When successful, door_ucred() writes a pointer to a user credential to the location pointed to by info if that location
was previously NULL. If that location was non-null, door_ucred() assumes that info points to a previously allocated
ucred_t which is then reused. The location pointed to by info can be used multiple times before being freed. The
value returned in info must be freed using ucred_free(3C).
The resulting user credential includes information about the effective user and group ID, the real user and group ID,
all privilege sets and the calling PID.
The credential information associated with the client refers to the information from the immediate caller, not neces<hy>
sarily from the first thread in a chain of door calls.
Upon successful completion, door_ucred() returns 0. Otherwise, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error,
in which case the memory location pointed to by the info argument is unchanged.
The door_ucred() function will fail if:
EAGAIN The location pointed to by info was NULL and allocating memory sufficient to hold a ucred failed.
EFAULT The address of the info argument is invalid.
EINVAL There is no associated door client.
ENOMEM The location pointed to by info was NULL and allocating memory sufficient to hold a ucred failed.
