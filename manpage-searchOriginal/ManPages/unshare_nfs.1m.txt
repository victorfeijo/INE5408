unshare_nfs <-> make local NFS file systems unavailable for mounting by remote systems
unshare [-F nfs] pathname
The unshare command makes local file systems unavailable for mounting by remote systems. The shared file sys<hy>
tem must correspond to a line with NFS as the FSType in the file /etc/dfs/sharetab.
The following options are supported:
-F This option may be omitted if NFS is the first file system type listed in the file /etc/dfs/fstypes.
/etc/dfs/fstypes
/etc/dfs/sharetab

If the file system being unshared is a symbolic link to a valid pathname, the canonical path (the path which the sym<hy>
bolic link follows) will be unshared.
For example, if /export/foo is a symbolic link to /export/bar (/export/foo -> /export/bar), the following unshare
command will result in /export/bar as the unshared pathname (and not /export/foo):
 example# unshare -F nfs /export/foo
For file systems that are accessed by NFS Version 4 clients, once the unshare is complete, all NFS Version 4 state
(open files and file locks) are released and unrecoverable by the clients. If the intent is to share the file system after
some administrative action, the NFS daemon (nfsd) should first be stopped and then the file system unshared. After
the administrative action is complete, the file system would then be shared and the NFS daemon restarted. See
nfsd(1M)
