Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI)
The M_SETOPTS message contains a stroptions structure and is used to control options in the stream head.
 uint_t so_flags; /* options to set */
 short so_readopt; /* read option */
 ushort_t so_wroff; /* write offset */
 ssize_t so_minpsz; /* minimum read packet size */
 ssize_t so_maxpsz; /* maximum read packet size */
 size_t so_hiwat; /* read queue high water mark */
 size_t so_lowat; /* read queue low water mark */
 unsigned char so_band; /* band for water marks */
 ushort_t so_erropt; /* error option */
The following are the flags that can be set in the so_flags bit mask in the stroptions structure. Note that multiple
flags can be set.
SO_READOPT Set read option.
SO_WROFF Set write offset.
SO_MINPSZ Set minimum packet size
SO_MAXPSZ Set maximum packet size.
SO_HIWAT Set high water mark.
SO_LOWAT Set low water mark.
SO_MREADON Set read notification ON.
SO_MREADOFF Set read notification OFF.
SO_NDELON Old TTY semantics for NDELAY reads and writes.
SO_NDELOFFSTREAMS Semantics for NDELAY reads and writes.
SO_ISTTY The stream is acting as a terminal.
SO_ISNTTY The stream is not acting as a terminal.
SO_TOSTOP Stop on background writes to this stream.
SO_TONSTOP Do not stop on background writes to this stream.

SO_BAND Water marks affect band.
SO_ERROPT Set error option.
When SO_READOPT is set, the so_readopt field of the stroptions structure can take one of the following values.
See read(2).
RNORM Read message normal.
RMSGD Read message discard.
RMSGN Read message, no discard.
When SO_BAND is set, so_band determines to which band so_hiwat and so_lowat apply.
When SO_ERROPT is set, the so_erropt field of the stroptions structure can take a value that is either none or one
of:
RERRNORM Persistent read errors; default.
RERRNONPERSIST Non-persistent read errors.
OR'ed with either none or one of:
WERRNORM Persistent write errors; default.
WERRNONPERSIST Non-persistent write errors.
