getfrm <-> returns the current frameID number
getfrm
getfrm returns the current frameID number. The frameID number is a number assigned to the frame by FMLI and
displayed flush left in the frame's title bar. If a frame is closed its frameID number may be reused when a new frame
is opened. getfrm takes no arguments. Example 1 A sample of the getfrm command.
If a menu whose frameID is 3 defines an item to have this action descriptor:
 action=open text stdtext `getfrm`
the text frame defined in the definition file stdtext would be passed the argument 3 when it is opened.
It is not a good idea to use getfrm in a backquoted expression coded on a line by itself. Stand-alone backquoted ex<hy>
pressions are evaluated before any descriptors are parsed, thus the frame is not yet fully current, and may not have
been assigned a frameID number.
