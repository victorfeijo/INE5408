#include <regex.h>
The <regex.h> header defines the structures and symbolic constants used by the regcomp(), regexec(), regerror(),
and regfree() functions. See regcomp(3C).
The structure type regex_t contains the following member:
 size_t re_nsub number of parenthesized subexpressions
The type size_t is defined as described in <sys/types.h>. See types.h(3HEAD).
The type regoff_t is defined as a signed integer type that can hold the largest value that can be stored in either a type
off_t or type ssize_t. The structure type regmatch_t contains the following members:
 regoff_t rm_so byte offset from start of string to start
  of substring
 regoff_t rm_eo byte offset from start of string of the
  first character after the end of substring
Values for the cflags parameter to the regcomp function are as follows:
REG_EXTENDED use extended regular expressions
REG_ICASE ignore case in match
REG_NOSUB report only success or fail in regexec()
REG_NEWLINE change the handling of NEWLINE character
Values for the eflags parameter to the regexec() function are as follows:
REG_NOTBOL The circumflex character (^), when taken as a special character, does not match the beginning of
string.
REG_NOTEOL The dollar sign ($), when taken as a special character, does not match the end of string.
The following constants are defined as error return values:
REG_NOMATCH regexec() failed to match.
REG_BADPAT Invalid regular expression.
REG_ECOLLATE Invalid collating element referenced.
REG_ECTYPE Invalid character class type referenced.
REG_EESCAPE Trailing '\' in pattern.
REG_ESUBREG Number in \fIdigit invalid or in error.

REG_EBRACK "[]" imbalance.
REG_EPAREN "\(\)" or "()" imbalance.
REG_EBRACE "" imbalance.
REG_BADBR Content of "" invalid: not a number, number too large, more than two numbers, first larger than sec<hy>
ond.
REG_ERANGE Invalid endpoint in range expression.
REG_ESPACE Out of memory.
REG_BADRPT '?', '*', or '+' not preceded by valid regular expression.
REG_ENOSYS Reserved.
