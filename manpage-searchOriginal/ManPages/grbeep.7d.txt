grbeep <-> Platform-dependent beep driver for SMBus-based hardware
beep@unit-address
The grbeep driver generates beeps on platforms (including Sun Blade 100, 150, 1500, 2500) that use SMBbus-based
registers and USB keyboards. When the KIOCCMD ioctl is issued to the USB keyboard module (see usbkbm(7M))
with command KBD_CMD_BELL/KBD_CMD_NOBELL, usbkbm(7M) passes the request to the grbeep driver
to turn the beep on and off, respectively.
