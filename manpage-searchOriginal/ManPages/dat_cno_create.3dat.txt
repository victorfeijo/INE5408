DAT_RETURN
 dat_cno_create (
 IN DAT_IA_HANDLE ia_handle,
 IN DAT_OS_WAIT_PROXY_AGENT agent,
 OUT DAT_CNO_HANDLE *cno_handle
 )
ia_handle Handle for an instance of DAT IA.
agent An optional OS Wait Proxy Agent that is to be invoked whenever CNO is invoked.
DAT_OS_WAIT_PROXY_AGENT_NULL indicates that there is no proxy agent
cno_handle Handle for the created instance of CNO.
The dat_cno_create() function creates a CNO instance. Upon creation, there are no Event Dispatchers feeding it.
The agent parameter specifies the proxy agent, which is OS-dependent and which is invoked when the CNO is trig<hy>
gered. After it is invoked, it is no longer associated with the CNO. The value of
DAT_OS_WAIT_PROXY_AGENT_NULL specifies that no OS Wait Proxy Agent is associated with the created
CNO.
Upon creation, the CNO is not associated with any EVDs, has no waiters and has, at most, one OS Wait Proxy
Agent.
DAT_SUCCESS The operation was successful.
DAT_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES The operation failed due to resource limitations.
DAT_INVALID_HANDLE The ia_handle parameter is invalid.
DAT_INVALID_PARAMETER One of the parameters was invalid, out of range, or a combination of parameters
was invalid, or the agent parameter is invalid.
