int ptree_add_node(picl_nodehdl_t parh, picl_nodehdl_t chdh);
int ptree_delete_node(ptree_delete_node nodeh);
The ptree_add_node() function adds the node specified by handle chdh as a child node to the node specified by the
handle parh. PICL_CANTPARENT is if the child node already has a parent.
The ptree_delete_node() function deletes the node specified by handle nodeh and all its descendant nodes from the
tree.
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. On failure, a non-negative integer is returned to indicate an error.
PICL_STALEHANDLE is returned if the handle is no longer valid. This occurs if the PICL tree was refreshed or
reinitialized.
PICL_INVALIDHANDLE is returned if the specified handle never existed.
PICL_NOTNODE Node a node
PICL_CANTPARENT Already has a parent
PICL_TREEBUSY PICL tree is busy
PICL_INVALIDHANDLE Invalid handle
PICL_STALEHANDLE Stale handle
PICL_FAILURE General system failure
