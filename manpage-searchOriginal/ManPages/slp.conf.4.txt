slp.conf <-> configuration file for Service Location Protocol agents
/etc/inet/slp.conf
slp.conf provides all Service Location Protocol ("SLP") agents with their operational configuration. slpd(1M)
reads slp.conf on startup. Service Agents ("SAs") and User Agents ("UAs") read slp.conf on invocation of the SA
and UA library routines; configuration parameters are then cached on a per-process basis. All SA's must use the
same set of properties as slpd on the local machine, since slpd acts as an SA server.
The configuration file format consists of a newline-delimited list of zero or more property definitions. Each property
definition corresponds to a particular configurable SLP, network, or other parameter in one or more of the three SLP
agents. The file format grammar is shown in RFC 2234 as follows:
 config-file = line-list
 line-list = line / line line-list
 line = property-line / comment-line
 comment-line = ( "#" / ";" ) 1*allchar newline
 property-line = property newline
 property = tag "=" value-list
 tag = prop / prop "." tag
 prop = 1*tagchar
 value-list = value / value "," value-list
 value = int / bool /
  "(" value-list ")" / string
 int = 1*DIGIT
 bool = "true" / "false" / "TRUE" / "FALSE"
 newline = CR / ( CRLF )
 string = 1*stringchar
 tagchar = DIGIT / ALPHA / tother / escape
 tother = %x21-%x2d / %x2f /
  %x3a / %x3c-%x40 /
  %x5b-%x60 / %7b-%7e
  ; i.e., all characters except `.',
  ; and `='.
 stringchar = DIGIT / ALPHA / sother / escape
 sother = %x21-%x29 / %x2a-%x2b /
  %x2d-%x2f / %x3a-%x40 /
  %x5b-%x60 / %7b-%7e
  ; i.e., all characters except `,'
 allchar = DIGIT / ALPHA / HTAB / SP
 escape = "
  ; Used for reserved characters
The properties fall into one of the following categories: <bu> DA Configuration <bu> Static Scope Configuration <bu> Tracing
and Logging <bu> Serialized Proxy Registrations <bu> Networking Configuration Parameters <bu> UA Configuration
The following are configuration properties and their parameters for DAs:
net.slp.isDA
Setting Type Boolean
Default Value False
Range of Values True or False
A boolean that indicates whether slpd(1M) is to act as a DA. If False, slpd(1M) is not run as a DA.
net.slp.DAHeartBeat
Setting Type Integer
<beginning of page>
Default Value 10800 seconds (3 hours)
Range of Values 2000 - 259200000 seconds
A 32-bit integer giving the number of seconds for the passive DA advertisement heartbeat. The default value is
10800 seconds. This property is ignored if net.slp.isDA is False.
net.slp.DAAttributes
Setting Type List of Strings
Default Value Unassigned
Range of Values List of Attribute Tag/Value List Pairs
A comma-separated list of parenthesized attribute tag/value list pairs that the DA must advertise in DA advertise<hy>
ments. The property must be in the SLP attribute list wire format, which requires that you use a backslash ("
The following properties and their parameters allow you to configure various aspects of scope and DA handling:
net.slp.useScopes
Setting Type List of Strings
Default Value Default, for SA and DA; unassigned for UA.
Range of Values List of Strings
A list of strings indicating either the scopes that a UA or an SA is allowed to use when making requests, or the
scopes a DA must support. If not present for the DA and SA, the default scope Default is used. If not present for
the UA, then the user scoping model is in force, in which active and passive DA or SA discovery are used for scope
discovery. The scope Default is used if no other information is available. If a DA or SA gets another scope in a re<hy>
quest, a SCOPE_NOT_SUPPORTED error is returned, unless the request was multicast, in which case it is
dropped. If a DA receives another scope in a registration, a SCOPE_NOT_SUPPORTED error will be returned.
Unlike other properties, this property is "read-only", so attempts to change it programmatically after the configura<hy>
tion file has been read are ignored.
net.slp.DAAddresses
Setting Type List of Strings
Default Value Unassigned
Range of Values IPv4 addresses or host names
A list of IP addresses or DNS-resolvable names that denote the DAs to use for statically configured UAs and
SAs. The property is read by slpd(1M), and registrations are forwarded to the DAs. The DAs are provided to UAs
upon request. Unlike other properties, this property is "read-only", so attempts to change it after the configuration
file has been read are ignored.
The following grammar describes the property:
 addr-list = addr / addr "," addr-list
 addr = fqdn / hostnumber
 fqdn = ALPHA / ALPHA *[ anum / "-" ] anum
<beginning of page>
 anum = ALPHA / DIGIT
 hostnumber = 1*3DIGIT 3("." 1*3DIGIT)
The following is an example using this grammar:
 sawah,mandi,sambal
IP addresses can be used instead of host names in networks where DNS is not deployed, but network administrators
are reminded that using IP addresses will complicate machine renumbering, since the SLP configuration property
files in statically configured networks will have to be changed.
These properties direct tracing and logging information to be sent to syslogd at the LOG_INFO priority. These
properties affect slpd(1M) only.
net.slp.traceDATraffic
Setting Type Boolean
Default Value False
Range of Values True or False
Set net.slp.traceDATraffic to True to enable logging of DA traffic by slpd.
net.slp.traceMsg
Setting Type Boolean
Default Value False
Range of Values True or False
Set net.slp.traceMsg to True to display details about SLP messages. The fields in all incoming messages and
outgoing replies are printed by slpd.
net.slp.traceDrop
Setting Type Boolean
Default Value False
Range of Values True or False
Set this property to True to display details when an SLPmessage is dropped by slpd for any reason.
net.slp.traceReg
Setting Type Boolean
Default Value False
Range of Values True or False
Set this property to True to display the table of service advertisements when a registration or deregistration is pro<hy>
<beginning of page>
cessed by slpd.
The following properties control reading and writing serialized registrations.
net.slp.serializedRegURL
Setting Type String
Default Value Unassigned
Range of Values Valid URL
A string containing a URL pointing to a document, which contains serialized registrations that should be pro<hy>
cessed when the slpd starts up.
The properties that follow allow you to set various network configuration parameters:
net.slp.isBroadcastOnly
Setting Type Boolean
Default Value False
Range of Values True or False
A boolean that indicates if broadcast should be used instead of multicast.
net.slp.multicastTTL
Setting Type Positive Integer
Default Value 255
Range of Values A positive integer from 1 to 255.
A positive integer less than or equal to 255 that defines the multicast TTL.
net.slp.DAActiveDiscoveryInterval
Setting Type Integer
Default Value 900 seconds (15 minutes)
Range of Values From 300 to 10800 seconds
A 16-bit positive integer giving the number of seconds between DA active discovery queries. The default value is
900 seconds (15 minutes). If the property is set to zero, active discovery is turned off. This is useful when the DAs
available are explicitly restricted to those obtained from the net.slp.DAAddresses property.
net.slp.multicastMaximumWait
<beginning of page>
Setting Type Integer
Default Value 15000 milliseconds (15 seconds)
Range of Values
 1000 to 60000 milliseconds
A 32-bit integer giving the maximum value for the sum of the net.slp.multicastTimeouts values and
net.slp.DADiscoveryTimeouts values in milliseconds.
net.slp.multicastTimeouts
Setting Type List of Integers
Default Value 3000,3000,3000,3000
Range of Values List of Positive Integers
A list of 32-bit integers used as timeouts, in milliseconds, to implement the multicast convergence algorithm. Each
value specifies the time to wait before sending the next request, or until nothing new has been learned from two suc<hy>
cessive requests. In a fast network the aggressive values of 1000,1250,1500,2000,4000 allow better performance.
The sum of the list must equal net.slp.multicastMaximumWait.
net.slp.passiveDADetection
Setting Type Boolean
Default Value True
Range of Values True or False
A boolean indicating whether slpd should perform passive DA detection.
net.slp.DADiscoveryTimeouts
Setting Type List of Integers.
Default Value 2000,2000,2000,2000,3000,4000
Range of Values List of Positive Integers
A list of 32-bit integers used as timeouts, in milliseconds, to implement the multicast convergence algorithm during
active DA discovery. Each value specifies the time to wait before sending the next request, or until nothing new has
been learned from two successive requests. The sum of the list must equal net.slp.multicastMaximumWait.
net.slp.datagramTimeouts
Setting Type List of Integers
<beginning of page>
Default Value 3000,3000,3000
Range of Values List of Positive Integers
A list of 32-bit integers used as timeouts, in milliseconds, to implement unicast datagram transmission to DAs. The
nth value gives the time to block waiting for a reply on the nth try to contact the DA.
net.slp.randomWaitBound
Setting Type Integer
Default Value 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
Range of Values 1000 to 3000 milliseconds
Sets the upper bound for calculating the random wait time before attempting to contact a DA.
net.slp.MTU
Setting Type Integer
Default Value 1400
Range of Values 128 to 8192
A 16-bit integer that specifies the network packet size, in bytes. The packet size includes IP and TCP or UDP head<hy>
ers.
net.slp.interfaces
Setting Type List of Strings
Default Value Default interface
Range of Values IPv4 addresses or host names
List of strings giving the IP addresses or host names of the network interface cards on which the DA or SA should
listen on port 427 for multicast, unicast UDP, and TCP messages. The default value is unassigned, indicating that
the default network interface card should be used. An example is:
 195.42.42.42,195.42.142.1,195.42.120.1
The example machine has three interfaces on which the DA should listen. Note that if IP addresses are used, the
property must be renumbered if the network is renumbered.
The following configuration parameters apply to the UA:
net.slp.locale
Setting Type String
<beginning of page>
Default Value en
Range of Values See RFC 1766 for a list of the locale language tag names.
A RFC 1766 Language Tag for the language locale. Setting this property causes the property value to become
the default locale for SLP messages.
net.slp.maxResults
Setting Type Integer
Default Value -1
Range of Values -1, positive integer
A 32 bit-integer that specifies the maximum number of results to accumulate and return for a synchronous request
before the timeout, or the maximum number of results to return through a callback if the request results are reported
asynchronously. Positive integers and -1 are legal values. If the value of net.slp.maxResults is -1, all results should
be returned.
net.slp.typeHint
Setting Type List of Strings
Default Value Unassigned
Range of Values Service type names
A list of service type names. In the absence of any DAs, UAs perform SA discovery to find scopes. If the
net.slp.typeHint property is set, only SA's advertising types on the list respond. Note that UAs set this property pro<hy>
grammatically. It is not typically set in the configuration file. The default is unassigned, meaning do not restrict the
type.
