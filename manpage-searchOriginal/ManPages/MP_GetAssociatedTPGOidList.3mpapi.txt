MP_STATUS MP_GetAssociatedTPGOidList(MP_OID oid,
 MP_OID_LIST **ppList);
oid The object ID of the multipath logical unit.
ppList A pointer to a pointer to an object ID that has type MP_OID_LIST structure. With a successful return, this
will contain a pointer to an object ID that has type MP_OID_LIST that contains the object IDs of target port groups
associated with the specified logical unit.
The MP_GetAssociatedTPGOidList() function gets a list of the object IDs containing the target port group associ<hy>
ated with the specified multipath logical unit.
When the caller is finished using the list, it must free the memory used by the list by calling MP_FreeOidList.
MP_STATUS_INVALID_OBJECT_TYPE
The oid does not specify any valid object type. This is most likely to happen if an uninitialized object ID is passed to
the API.
MP_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER
The ppList is null or specifies a memory area to which data cannot be written, or the oid has a type subfield other
than MP_OBJECT_TYPE_MULTIPATH_LU.
MP_STATUS_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND
The oid owner ID or object sequence number is invalid.
MP_STATUS_SUCCESS
The operation is successful.
MP_STATUS_FAILED
The target port group list for the specified object ID is not found.
MP_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY
A memory allocation failure occurred.
