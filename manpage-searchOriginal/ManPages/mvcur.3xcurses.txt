int mvcur(int oldrow, int oldcol, int newrow, int newcol);
oldrow Is the row from which cursor is to be moved.
oldcol Is the column from which cursor is to be moved.
newrow Is the row to which cursor is to be moved.
newcol Is the column to which cursor is to be moved.
The mvcur() function is a low-level function used only outside of X/Open Curses when the program has to deal di<hy>
rectly with the terminfo database to handle certain terminal capabilities. The use of appropriate X/Open Curses
functions is recommended in all other situations, so that X/Open Curses can track the cursor.
The mvcur() function moves the cursor from the location specified by oldrow and oldcol to the location specified by
newrow and newcol. A program using this function must keep track of the current cursor position.
On success, the mvcur() function returns OK. Otherwise, it returns ERR.
None.
