The getauclassent() function and getauclassnam() each return an audit_class entry.
The getauclassnam() function searches for an audit_class entry with a given class name name.
The getauclassent() function enumerates audit_class entries. Successive calls to getauclassent() return either suc<hy>
cessive audit_class entries or NULL.
The setauclass() function ``rewinds'' to the beginning of the enumeration of audit_class entries. Calls to getau<hy>
classnam() may leave the enumeration in an indeterminate state, so setauclass() should be called before the first
getauclassent().
The endauclass() may be called to indicate that audit_class processing is complete; the system may then close any
open audit_class file, deallocate storage, and so forth.
The getauclassent_r() and getauclassnam_r() functions both return a pointer to an audit_class entry as do their
similarly named counterparts. They each take an additional argument, a pointer to pre-allocated space for an
au_class_ent_t, which is returned if the call is successful. To assure there is enough space for the information re<hy>
turned, the applications programmer should be sure to allocate AU_CLASS_NAME_MAX and AU_CLASS_DE<hy>
SC_MAX bytes for the ac_name and ac_desc members of the au_class_ent_t data structure.
The internal representation of an audit_user entry is an au_class_ent structure defined in <bsm/libbsm.h> with the
following members:
 char *ac_name;
 au_class_t ac_class;
 char *ac_desc;
The getauclassnam() and getauclassnam_r() functions return a pointer to a au_class_ent structure if they success<hy>
fully locate the requested entry. Otherwise they return NULL.
The getauclassent() and getauclassent_r() functions return a pointer to a au_class_ent structure if they successful<hy>
ly enumerate an entry. Otherwise they return NULL, indicating the end of the enumeration.

All of the functions described on this man-page are MT-Safe except getauclassent() and getauclassnam, which are
Unsafe. The getauclassent_r() and getauclassnam_r() functions have the same functionality as the Unsafe func<hy>
