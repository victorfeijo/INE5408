mech, qop <-> mechanism and QOP files
/etc/gss/mech
/etc/gss/qop
The /etc/gss/mech and /etc/gss/qop files contain tables showing installed security mechanisms and the Quality of
Protection (QOP) associated with them, respectively. As security mechanisms are installed on the system, entries are
added to these two files. Contents of these files may be accessed either manually or programmatically. For example,
manually with cat(1) or more(1), or programmatically with either rpc_gss_get_mechanisms(3NSL) or
rpc_gss_get_mech_info(3NSL).
The order of entries in the /etc/gss/mech file is significant: the order should be from the most preferred to the least
preferred mechanisms.
The /etc/gss/mech file contains five fields:
mechanism name
ASCII string representing the mechanism.
object identifier
RPC OID for this mechanism.
shared library
Shared library which implements the services provided by this mechanism.
kernel module
Kernel module which implements the services provided by this mechanism.
library options (optional field)
Optional parameters that are interpreted by the individual mechanism with which they are associated. Specific sup<hy>
ported options are described in the documentation for the individual mechanism, if any. Not all mechanisms have
support for optional parameters. library options must be enclosed in brackets ([ ]) so they may be differentiated from
the optional kernel module entries.
The /etc/gss/qop file contains three fields:
QOP string Name, in ASCII, of this Quality of Protection.
QOP value Numeric value by which RPC identifies this QOP.
mechanism name ASCII string representing the mechanism with which this QOP is associated.
