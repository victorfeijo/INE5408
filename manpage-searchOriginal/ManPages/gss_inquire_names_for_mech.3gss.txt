OM_uint32 gss_inquire_names_for_mech(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
 const gss_OID mechanism,gss_OID_set *name_types);
The gss_inquire_names_for_mech() function returns the set of name-types supported by the specified mechanism.
The parameter descriptions for gss_inquire_names_for_mech() follow:
minor_status A mechanism-specific status code.
mechanism The mechanism to be interrogated.
name_types Set of name-types supported by the specified mechanism. The returned OID set must be freed by the
application after use with a call to gss_release_oid_set(3GSS).
The gss_inquire_names_for_mech() function may return the following values:
GSS_S_COMPLETE Successful completion.
GSS_S_FAILURE The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific GSS status code is defined.
The mechanism-specific status code reported by means of the minor_status parameter details the error condition.
