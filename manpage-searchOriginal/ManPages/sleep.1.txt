sleep <-> suspend execution for an interval
/usr/bin/sleep seconds
sleep seconds
sleep suspends execution for at least the time in seconds specified by seconds or until a SIGALRM signal is re<hy>
ceived. The seconds operand can be specified as a floating point number but the actual granularity normally depends
on the underlying system.
The following operands are supported for /usr/bin/sleep and ksh93's sleep built-in command:
seconds A non-negative floating-point number specifying the number of seconds for which to suspend execution.
The floating-point number may be specified in all formats required by C99/XPG6, including constants such as "Inf"
or "infinite".
The following operands are supported:
time Specify time in seconds as a floating point number. The actual granularity depends on the underlying system,
normally around 1 millisecond.
Example 1 Suspending Command Execution
The following example executes a command after a certain amount of time:
 example% (sleep 105; command)&
Example 2 Executing a Command Every So Often
The following example executes a command every so often:
 example% while true
 do
  command
  sleep 37
 done
Example 3 Suspend command execution forever (or until a SIGALRM signal is received)
 example% sleep Inf
Example 4 Suspending command execution for 0.5 seconds
Suspending command execution for 0.5 seconds using an alternative floating-point representation for the value "0.5"
 example% printf "%a0 0.5
 0x1.0000000000000000000000000000p-01
 example% sleep 0x1.0000000000000000000000000000p-01
See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of sleep: LANG,
LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.
The following exit values are returned:
<beginning of page>
0 The execution was successfully suspended for at least time seconds, or a SIGALRM signal was received (see
NOTES).
>0 An error has occurred.

If the sleep utility receives a SIGALRM signal, one of the following actions is taken: <bu> Terminate normally with a
zero exit status. <bu> Effectively ignore the signal.
The sleep utility takes the standard action for all other signals.
The behavior for input values such as "NaN" (not-a-number) or negative values is undefined.
