dirname <-> report the parent directory name of a file path name
#include <libgen.h>
char *dirname(char *path);
The dirname() function takes a pointer to a character string that contains a pathname, and returns a pointer to a
string that is a pathname of the parent directory of that file. Trailing '/' characters in the path are not counted as part
of the path.
If path does not contain a '/', then dirname() returns a pointer to the string "." . If path is a null pointer or points to
an empty string, dirname() returns a pointer to the string "." .
The dirname() function returns a pointer to a string that is the parent directory of path. If path is a null pointer or
points to an empty string, a pointer to a string "." is returned.
No errors are defined. Example 1 Changing the Current Directory to the Parent Directory.
The following code fragment reads a pathname, changes the current working directory to the parent directory of the
named file (see chdir(2)), and opens the file.
 char path[[MAXPATHLEN], *pathcopy;
 int fd;
 fgets(path, MAXPATHLEN, stdin);
 pathcopy = strdup(path);
 chdir(dirname(pathcopy));
 fd = open(basename(path), O_RDONLY);
Example 2 Sample Input and Output Strings for dirname().
In the following table, the input string is the value pointed to by path, and the output string is the return value of the
dirname() function.
tab() box; cw(2.75i) |cw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) |lw(2.75i) Input StringOutput String _ "/usr/lib"""/usr" _ "/usr/""/" _
"usr""/" _ "/""/" _ ".""." _ "..""."
The dirname() function modifies the string pointed to by path.
The dirname() and basename(3C) functions together yield a complete pathname. The expression dirname(path)
obtains the pathname of the directory where basename(path) is found.
