wmemset <-> set wide-characters in memory
#include <wchar.h>
wchar_t *wmemset(wchar_t *ws, wchar_t wc, size_t n);
The wmemset() function copies the value of wc into each of the first n wide-characters of the object pointed to by
ws. This function is not affected by locale and all wchar_t values are treated identically. The null wide-character
and wchar_t values not corresponding to valid characters are not treated specially.
If n is 0, ws must be a valid pointer and the function copies zero wide-characters.
The wmemset() functions returns the value of ws.
No errors are defined.
