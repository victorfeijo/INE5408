MM_HARD Source of the condition is hardware.
MM_SOFT Source of the condition is software.
MM_FIRM Source of the condition is firmware.
MM_APPL Condition detected by application.
MM_UTIL Condition detected by utility.
MM_OPSYS Condition detected by operating system.

MM_INFO Informative message.
MM_NOSEV No severity level provided for the message.
MM_PRINT Display message on standard error.
MM_CONSOLE Display message on system console.
The table below indicates the null values and identifiers for fmtmsg(3C) arguments. The <fmtmsg.h> header defines
the macros in the Identifier column, which expand to constant expressions that expand to expressions of the type in<hy>
dicated in the Type column:
