wusb_ca <-> WUSB Cable Association Driver
The wusb_ca driver is a USBA (Solaris USB Architecture) compliant client driver that supports the cable associa<hy>
tion model which is defined in Association Models Supplement to the Certified WUSB specification.
The wireless USB cable association driver is a USB class driver that provides interfaces for establishing a first-time
connection between Wireless USB hosts and devices. This process of establishing a first-time connection is called
association in WUSB standard. It is a prerequisite process that must be completed by hosts and devices prior to im<hy>
plementing the security requirements outlined in Wireless Universal Serial Bus Specification 1.0.
Users should use wusbadm(1M) to do cable association for WUSB devices.
