ranlib <-> convert archives to random libraries
ranlib archive
The ranlib utility was used in SunOS 4.x to add a table of contents to archive libraries, which converted each archive
to a form that could be linked more rapidly. This is no longer needed, as the ar(1) command automatically provides
all the functionality ranlib used to provide.
This script is provided as a convenience for software developers who need to maintain Makefiles that are portable
across a variety of operating systems.
ranlib has exit status 0.
