LayoutObject m_create_layout(const AttrObject attrobj,
 const char*modifier);
The m_create_layout() function creates a LayoutObject associated with the locale identified by attrobj.
The LayoutObject is an opaque object containing all the data and methods necessary to perform the layout opera<hy>
tions on context-dependent or directional characters of the locale identified by the attrobj. The memory for the Lay<hy>
outObject is allocated by m_create_layout(). The LayoutObject created has default layout values. If the modifier
argument is not NULL, the layout values specified by the modifier overwrite the default layout values associated with
the locale. Internal states maintained by the layout transformation function across transformations are set to their
initial values.
The attrobj argument is or may be an amalgam of many opaque objects. A locale object is just one example of the
type of object that can be attached to an attribute object. The attrobj argument specifies a name that is usually associ<hy>
ated with a locale category. If attrobj is NULL, the created LayoutObject is associated with the current locale as set
by the setlocale(3C) function.
The modifier argument announces a set of layout values when the LayoutObject is created.
Upon successful completion, the m_create_layout() function returns a LayoutObject for use in subsequent calls to
m_*_layout() functions. Otherwise the m_create_layout() function returns (LayoutObject) 0 and sets errno to in<hy>
dicate the error.
The m_create_layout() function may fail if:
EBADF The attribute object is invalid or the locale asssociated with the attribute object is not available.
EINVAL The modifier string has a syntax error or it contains unknown layout values.
EMFILE There are {OPEN_MAX} file descriptors currently open in the calling process.
ENOMEM Insufficient storage space is available.
