The stty utility sets certain terminal I/O options for the device that is the current standard input. Without arguments,
stty reports the settings of certain options.
In this report, if a character is preceded by a caret (^), then the value of that option is the corresponding control char<hy>
acter (for example, ^h is CTRL-h. In this case, recall that CTRL-h is the same as the BACKSPACE key). The se<hy>
quence ^@ means that an option has a null value.
See termio(7I) for detailed information about the modes listed from Control Modes through Local Modes. For de<hy>
tailed information about the modes listed under Hardware Flow Control Modes and Clock Modes, see
termiox(7I).
Operands described in the Combination Modes section are implemented using options in the earlier sections. No<hy>
tice that many combinations of options make no sense, but no sanity checking is performed. Hardware flow control
and clock modes options might not be supported by all hardware interfaces.
The following options are supported:
-a Writes to standard output all of the option settings for the terminal.
-g Reports current settings in a form that can be used as an argument to another stty command. Emits termios-type
output if the underlying driver supports it. Otherwise, it emits termio-type output.
The following mode operands are supported:
parenb(-parenb) Enable (disable) parity generation and detection.
parext(-parext) Enable (disable) extended parity generation and detection for mark and space parity.
parodd(-parodd) Select odd (even) parity, or mark (space) parity if parext is enabled.

control-character c
Set control-character to c, where:
control-character is ctab, discard, dsusp, eof, eol, eol2, erase, intr, kill, lnext, quit, reprint, start, stop, susp,
swtch, or werase (ctab is used with -stappl, see termio(7I)). For information on swtch, see NOTES.
c If c is a single character, the control character is set to that character.
In the POSIX locale, if c is preceded by a caret (^) indicating an escape from the shell and is one of those listed in
the ^c column of the following table, then its value used (in the Value column) is the corresponding control character
(for example, ``^d'' is a CTRL-d). ``^?'' is interpreted as DEL and ``^<mi>'' is interpreted as undefined.

The -g flag is designed to facilitate the saving and restoring of terminal state from the shell level. For example, a pro<hy>
gram can:
 saveterm="$(stty -g)" # save terminal state
 stty (new settings) # set new state
 ... # ...
 stty $saveterm # restore terminal state
Since the -a format is so loosely specified, scripts that save and restore terminal settings should use the -g option.
See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of stty: LANG,
LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.

Solaris does not support any of the actions implied by swtch, which was used by the sxt driver on System V release
4. Solaris allows the swtch value to be set, and prints it out if set, but it does not perform the swtch action.
The job switch functionality on Solaris is actually handled by job control. susp is the correct setting for this.
