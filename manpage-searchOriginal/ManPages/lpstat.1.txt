lpstat <-> print information about the status of the print service
lpstat [-d] [-r] [-R] [-s] [-t] [-a [list]] [-c [list]]
 [-f [list]] [-o [list]] [-p [list] [-D]] [-S [list]]
 [-u [login- ID -list]] [-v [list]] [-l level]
The lpstat utility displays information about the current status of the LP print service to standard output.
If no options are given, lpstat prints the status of all the user's print requests made by lp. See lp(1). Any arguments
that are not options are assumed to be request-IDs as returned by lp. The lpstat command prints the status of such
requests. options appears in any order and can be repeated and intermixed with other arguments. Some key letters
can be followed by an optional list that can be in one of two forms: a list of items separated from one another by a
comma, or a list of items separated from one another by spaces enclosed in quotes. For example:
 example% lpstat -u "user1 user2 user3"
Specifying all after any key letter that takes list as an argument causes all information relevant to the key letter to be
printed. For example, the command:
 example% lpstat -o all
prints the status of all output requests.
The omission of a list following such key letters causes all information relevant to the key letter to be printed. For
example, the command:
 example% lpstat -o
prints the status of all output requests.
The print client commands locate destination information using the "printers" database in the name service switch.
See nsswitch.conf(4), printers(4), and printers.conf(4) for details.
The following options are supported:
-a [list] Reports whether print destinations are accepting requests. list is a list of intermixed printer names and class
names.
If the print queue is remote and IPP is in use, the information provided is very close to that reported for local queues.
If the print queue is remote and IPP is not in use (the print server is older than Solaris 9, Update 6 or another
RFC-1179-based print service), this option does not report any useful information.
-c [list] Prints name of all classes and their members. list is a list of class names.
If the print queue is remote and IPP is in use, the information provided is very close to that reported for local queues.
If the print queue is remote and IPP is not in use (the print server is older than Solaris 9, Update 6 or another
RFC-1179-based print service), this option does not report any useful information.
-d Prints the default destination for output requests.
-f[list] [-l] Prints a verification that the forms in list are recognized by the LP print service. list is a list of forms; the
default is all. The -l option lists the form descriptions.
If the print queue is remote and IPP is in use, the information provided is very close to that reported for local queues.
If the print queue is remote and IPP is not in use (the print server is older than Solaris 9, Update 6 or another
RFC-1179-based print service), this option does not report any useful information.

-l [level] Specifies the verbosity level for extended reporting of printer or job objects (-o, -p, -r, -u). Without this op<hy>
tion, a level of 0 is used, which reports summary information. When no level is specified, a level of 1is used, which
provides more information about the object. A level of 2 or more enumerates all of the object's attributes.
If the print queue is remote and IPP is in use, the information provided is very close to that reported for local queues.
If the print queue is remote and IPP is not in use (the print server is older than Solaris 9, Update 6 or another
RFC-1179-based print service), this option does not report any useful information.
-o [list] Prints the status of output requests. list is a list of intermixed printer names, class names, and request-IDs.
The key letter -o can be omitted.
Specify printer and class names using atomic, URI-style (scheme://endpoint), or POSIX-style (server:destination)
names. See printers.conf(4) for more information.
-p [list] [-D] Prints the status of printers. list is a list of printer names. If the -D option is given, a brief description is
printed for each printer in list. If the -l option is given and the printer is on the local machine, a full description of
each printer's configuration is returned, including the form mounted, the acceptable content and printer types, a
printer description, and the interface used.
If the print queue is remote and IPP is in use, correct job id is reported. If the print queue is remote and IPP is not in
use (the print server is older than Solaris 9, Update 6 or another RFC-1179-based print service), -p [list] always re<hy>
ports the first job in the queue irrespective of its status.
-r Prints the status of the LP request scheduler.
-R Prints a number showing the position of each request in the print queue.
-s Prints a status summary, including the status of the LP scheduler, the default destination, a list of printers and their
associated devices, a list of the machines sharing print services, a list of all forms currently mounted, and a list of all
recognized character sets and print wheels.
-S [list] Prints a verification that the character sets or the print wheels specified in list are recognized by the LP print
service. Items in list can be character sets or print wheels; the default for the list is all. If the -l option is given, each
line is appended by a list of printers that can handle the print wheel or character set. The list also shows whether the
print wheel or character set is mounted, or specifies the built-in character set into which it maps.
If the print queue is remote and IPP is in use, the information provided is very close to that reported for local queues.
If the print queue is remote and IPP is not in use (the print server is older than Solaris 9, Update 6 or another
RFC-1179-based print service), this option does not report any useful information.
-t Prints all status information. This includes all the information obtained with the -s option, plus the acceptance and
idle/busy status of all printers.
-u [login-ID-list] Prints the status of output requests for users. The login-ID-list argument can include any or all of
the following constructs:
login-ID a user on any system
system_name!login-ID a user on system system_name
system_name!all all users on system system_name
all!login-ID a user on all systems
<beginning of page>
all all users on all systems
-v [list] Prints the names of printers and the path names of the devices associated with them or remote system names
for network printers. list is a list of printer names.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
non-zero An error occurred.

For remote print queues, the BSD print protocol provides a very limited set of information. The Internet Print Proto<hy>
col (IPP) is preferred.
When IPP is in use, the user is prompted for a passphrase if the remote print service is configured to require authen<hy>
tication.
