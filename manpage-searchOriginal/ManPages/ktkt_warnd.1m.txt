ktkt_warnd <-> Kerberos warning daemon
/usr/lib/krb5/ktkt_warnd
ktkt_warnd is a daemon on Kerberos clients that can warn users when their Kerberos tickets are about to expire or
renew the tickets before they expire. It is invoked by inetd when a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) is obtained for the
first time, such as after using the kinit command. ktkt_warnd can be configured through the /etc/krb5/warn.conf
file on the client. In warn.conf, you can specify that you be supplied notice, through syslog or terminal or mail, of
ticket expiration or to renew the TGT.
