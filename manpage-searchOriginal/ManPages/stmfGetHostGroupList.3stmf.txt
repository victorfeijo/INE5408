int stmfGetInitiatorGroupList(stmfGroupList **hostGroupList);
hostGroupList A pointer to a pointer to an stmfGroupList structure. On successful return, this will contain a list of
host groups.
The stmfGetInitiatorGroupList() function retrieves the list of host groups. The caller should call stmfFreeMemo<hy>
ry(3STMF) when this list is no longer needed.
The following values are returned:
STMF_ERROR_NOMEM The library was unable to allocate sufficient memory for hostGroupList.
STMF_STATUS_SUCCESS The API call was successful.
