int redrawwin(WINDOW *win);
int wredrawln(WINDOW *win, int beg_line, int num_lines);
win Is a pointer to the window in which to redraw.
beg_line Is the first line to redraw.
num_lines Is the number of lines to redraw.
The redrawwin() and wredrawln() functions force portions of a window to be redrawn to the terminal when the
next refresh operation is performed.
The redrawwin() function forces the entire window win to be redrawn, while the wredrawln() function forces only
num_lines lines starting with beg_line to be redrawn. Normally, refresh operations use optimization methods to re<hy>
duce the actual amount of the screen to redraw based on the current screen contents. These functions tell the refresh
operations not to attempt any optimization when redrawing the indicated areas.
These functions are useful when the data that exists on the screen is believed to be corrupt and for applications such
as screen editors that redraw portions of the screen.
On success, these functions return OK. Otherwise, they return ERR.
None.
