These macros classify character-coded integer values. Each is a predicate returning non-zero for true, 0 for false.
The behavior of these macros, except isascii(), is affected by the current locale (see setlocale(3C)). To modify the
behavior, change the LC_TYPE category in setlocale(), that is, setlocale(LC_CTYPE, newlocale). In the "C" lo<hy>
cale, or in a locale where character type information is not defined, characters are classified according to the rules of
the US-ASCII 7-bit coded character set.
The isascii() macro is defined on all integer values. The rest are defined only where the argument is an int, the value
of which is representable as an unsigned char, or EOF, which is defined by the <stdio.h> header and represents
end-of-file.
Functions exist for all the macros defined below. To get the function form, the macro name must be undefined (for
example, #undef isdigit).
For macros described with Default and Standard conforming versions, standard-conforming behavior is provided
for standard-conforming applications (see standards(5)) and for applications that define
__XPG4_CHAR_CLASS__ before including <ctype.h>.
isalpha() Tests for any character for which isupper() or islower() is true.
isalpha() Tests for any character for which isupper() or islower() is true, or any character that is one of the current
locale-defined set of characters for which none of iscntrl(), isdigit(), ispunct(), or isspace() is true. In "C" locale,
isalpha() returns true only for the characters for which isupper() or islower() is true.
isalnum() Tests for any character for which isalpha() or isdigit() is true (letter or digit).
isascii() Tests for any ASCII character, code between 0 and 0177 inclusive.
isblank() Tests whether c is a character of class blank in the current locale. This macro/function is not available to
applications conforming to standards prior to SUSv3. See standards(5)

iscntrl() Tests for any ``control character'' as defined by the character set.
isdigit() Tests for any decimal-digit character.
isgraph() Tests for any character for which ispunct(), isupper(), islower(), and isdigit() is true.
isgraph() Tests for any character for which isalnum() and ispunct() are true, or any character in the current locale-
defined "graph" class which is neither a space ("") nor a character for which iscntrl() is true.
islower() Tests for any character that is a lower-case letter or is one of the current locale-defined set of characters for
which none of iscntrl(), isdigit(), ispunct(), isspace(), or isupper() is true. In the "C" locale, islower() returns true
only for the characters defined as lower-case ASCII characters.
isprint() Tests for any character for which ispunct(), isupper(), islower(), isdigit(), and the space character ("") is
true.
isprint() Tests for any character for which iscntrl() is false, and isalnum(), isgraph(), ispunct(), the space character
(""), and the characters in the current locale-defined "print" class are true.
ispunct() Tests for any printing character which is neither a space ("") nor a character for which isalnum() or iscn<hy>
trl() is true.
isspace() Tests for any space, tab, carriage-return, newline, vertical-tab or form-feed (standard white-space charac<hy>
ters) or for one of the current locale-defined set of characters for which isalnum() is false. In the "C" locale, iss<hy>
pace() returns true only for the standard white-space characters.
isupper() Tests for any character that is an upper-case letter or is one of the current locale-defined set of characters
for which none of iscntrl(), isdigit(), ispunct(), isspace(), or islower() is true. In the "C" locale, isupper() returns
true only for the characters defined as upper-case ASCII characters.
isxdigit() Tests for any hexadecimal-digit character ([0<mi>9], [A<mi>F], or [a<mi>f]).
isxdigit() Tests for any hexadecimal-digit character ([0<mi>9], [A<mi>F], or [a<mi>f] or the current locale-defined sets of char<hy>
acters representing the hexadecimal digits 10 to 15 inclusive). In the "C" locale, only
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F a b c d e f
are included.
If the argument to any of the character handling macros is not in the domain of the function, the result is undefined.
Otherwise, the macro or function returns non-zero if the classification is TRUE and 0 if the classification is FALSE.
These macros or functions can be used safely in multithreaded applications, as long as setlocale(3C) is not being
called to change the locale.
