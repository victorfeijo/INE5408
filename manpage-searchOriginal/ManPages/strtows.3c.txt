strtows, wstostr <-> code conversion for Process Code and File Code
#include <widec.h>
wchar_t *strtows(wchar_t *dst, char *src);
char *wstostr(char *dst, wchar_t *src);
The strtows() and wstostr() functions convert strings back and forth between File Code representation and Process
Code.
The strtows() function takes a character string src, converts it to a Process Code string, terminated by a Process
Code null, and places the result into dst.
The wstostr() function takes the Process Code string pointed to by src, converts it to a character string, and places
the result into dst.
The strtows() function returns the Process Code string if it completes successfully. Otherwise, a null pointer will be
returned and errno will be set to EILSEQ.
The wstostr() function returns the File Code string if it completes successfully. Otherwise, a null pointer will be re<hy>
turned and errno will be set to EILSEQ.
