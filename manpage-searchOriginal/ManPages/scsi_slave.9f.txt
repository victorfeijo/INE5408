scsi_slave <-> utility for SCSI target drivers to establish the presence of a target
#include <sys/scsi/scsi.h>
int scsi_slave(struct scsi_device *devp, int (*callback)(void));
The scsi_slave() function is obsolete. This function has been replaced by scsi_probe(9F).
devp Pointer to a scsi_device(9S) structure.
callback Pointer to a callback function, NULL_FUNC or SLEEP_FUNC.
scsi_slave() checks for the presence of a SCSI device. Target drivers may use this function in their probe(9E) rou<hy>
tines. scsi_slave() determines if the device is present by using a Test Unit Ready command followed by an Inquiry
command. If scsi_slave() is successful, it will fill in the scsi_inquiry structure, which is the sd_inq member of the
scsi_device(9S) structure, and return SCSI_PROBE_EXISTS. This information can be used to determine if the tar<hy>
get driver has probed the correct SCSI device type. callback indicates what the allocator routines should do when
DMA resources are not available:
NULL_FUNC Do not wait for resources. Return a NULL pointer.
SLEEP_FUNC Wait indefinitely for resources.
Other Values callback points to a function which is called when resources may have become available. callback
must return either 0 (indicating that it attempted to allocate resources but again failed to do so), in which case it is
put back on a list to be called again later, or 1 indicating either success in allocating resources or indicating that it no
longer cares for a retry.
scsi_slave() returns:
SCSIPROBE_NOMEM No space available for structures.
SCSIPROBE_EXISTS Device exists and inquiry data is valid.
SCSIPROBE_NONCCS Device exists but inquiry data is not valid.
SCSIPROBE_FAILURE Polled command failure.
SCSIPROBE_NORESP No response to TEST UNIT READY.
scsi_slave() is normally called from the target driver's probe(9E) or attach(9E) routine. In any case, this routine
should not be called from interrupt context, because it can sleep waiting for memory to be allocated.
