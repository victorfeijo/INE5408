hextoalabel <-> convert an internal text label to its human readable equivalent
/usr/sbin/hextoalabel [internal-text-sensitivity-label]
/usr/sbin/hextoalabel -c [internal-text-clearance]
hextoalabel converts an internal text label into its human readable equivalent and writes the result to the standard
output file. This internal form is often hexadecimal. If no option is supplied, the label is assumed to be a sensitivity
label.
If no internal text label is specified, the label is read from the standard input file. The expected use of this command
is emergency repair of labels that are stored in internal databases.
-c Identifies the internal text label as a clearance.
The following exit values are returned:
0 On success.
1 On failure, and writes diagnostics to the standard error file.
