The Media Management System (MMS) is a software interface that manages removable storage media such as tape
libraries, tape drives, media pools, tape volumes, and disk resources that emulate tape drives and tape volumes. It is
an implementation of the IEEE 1244 specification for removable media.
The MMS consists of an MM server and database that control various library managers and drive managers. Admin<hy>
istrators use mmsadm and its subcommands to configure and maintain storage resources from a variety of vendors.
The MMS management commands, such as mmsadm, construct and issue the most frequently-used Media Manage<hy>
ment Protocol (MMP) commands, handling all events and acknowledgments. The MMP is defined in the IEEE 1244
specification.
The mmsinit(1M) command must be run to initialize MMS on a system before you can use the mmsadm command.
The mmsadm command is RBAC-compliant. (See rbac(5).) Required authorizations vary among individual sub<hy>
commands and are listed in the descriptions of those subcommands.
The mmsadm supports the subcommands listed below. Each subcommand description includes a description of that
subcommand's options and operands. A mmsadm command takes the form:
 # mmsadm subcommand [options]
<beginning of page>
The discover subcommand displays the library, drives, or volumes on an Automated Control System Library Server
(ACSLS) server, or the tape drives connected to the local system. Use this command to determine what resources are
available and whether they have been configured for use with MMS.
discover requires the solaris.smf.read.mms authorization. The subcommand has the following syntax:
 mmsadm discover [-H] [-t library|drive|vol]
  [-S ACSLS-host[:port]] -a
The subcommand options are described as follows.
-a
Displays all discovered resources, including those configured for MMS. By default, only unconfigured resources are
displayed.
-H
Displays the resources in a manner parseable by scripts. The display does not include headers and it separates fields
with a tab character.
-S ACSLS-host[:port]
Displays resources managed by the specified server and port. The default port number is 50004. If the -S option is
not used, the command displays tape drives connected to the local system.
-t library|drive|vol
Displays only the specified type of resource:
-t library
Shows discovered libraries.
-t drive
Shows discovered drives.
-t vol
Shows discovered volumes.
If this option is not used, library and drive resources are included in the display. The number of volumes can be large
so their discovery must be requested explicitly.
The create subcommand configures the resource to be managed by MMS. The set subcommand modifies the at<hy>
tributes of a resource managed by MMS. These subcommands share a common set of options.
ACSLS-controlled libraries and disk archiving libraries are supported. Libraries must be configured before any drive
pool and drives managed in that library can be configured, or any volumes managed by the library added to media
pools. voltype must be configured before adding volumes to media pools.
The create and set subcommands require the solaris.smf.modify.mms, solaris.smf.value.mms, solaris.mms.*, and
solaris.smf.read.mms authorizations, with the exception of changing tracing attributes. If changing the size of trace
files or trace level, only solaris.mms.device.log and solaris.smf.read.mms authorizations are required.
These subcommands have the following syntax:
<beginning of page>
 create -t library|drive|mpool|dpool|app|voltype

Example 9 Configure an MMS for Three Applications
The following sequence of commands illustrates the process of configuring a Media Management System for three
applications, engineering, finance, and backup.
Initialize the MM server and set the administrator password to mmsadm2008 in the password file, mmsadm_pass<hy>
wd:
 # mmsinit -P ~/mmsadm_passwd
Create an application for the engineering application:
<beginning of page>
 # mmsadm create -t app -P ~/eng_passwd eng
Create an application for the finance application:
 # mmsadm create -t app -P ~/finance_passwd finance
Create an application for the backup application:
 # mmsadm create -t app -P ~/backup_passwd backup
Create an L700 library named library1:
 # mmsadm create -t library -o acsls=mms-280-1 -o hwtype=L700 \
 -o acs=0 -o lsm=0 -o serialno=MPC02201638 library1
Create a drive pool named org_dpool, to be shared between the engineering and finance applications:
 # mmsadm create -t dpool -o apps=eng,finance org_dpool
Create a drive pool named shared_dpool, to be shared by the engineering, finance, and backup applications:
 # mmsadm create -t dpool -o apps=eng,finance,backup shared_dpool
Create an exclusive drive pool for the backup application named bk_dpool:
 # mmsadm create -t dpool -o apps=backup bk_dpool
Add a 9940 drive named drive1 shared by the engineering and finance applications:
 # mmsadm create -t drive -o hwtype=9940 -o serialno=479000002009 \
 -o library=library1 -o dpool=org_dpool drive1
Add a 9940 drive named drive2 shared by the engineering, finance, and backup applications:
 # mmsadm create -t drive -o hwtype=9940 -o serialno=479000001954 \
 -o library=library1 -o dpool=shared_dpool drive2
Add an exclusive 9940 drive named drive3 for the backup application:
<beginning of page>
 # mmsadm create -t drive -o hwtype=9940 -o serialno=479000001944 \
 -o library=library1 -o dpool=bk_dpool drive3
Create media pool for the engineering and finance applications named org_mpool:
 # mmsadm create -t mpool -o apps=eng,finance org_mpool
Create an exclusive media pool for the backup application named bk_mpool:
 # mmsadm create -t mpool -o apps=backup bk_mpool
Add three volumes to the engineering and finance media pool:
 # mmsadm add-volume -l library1 -o voltype=9940 \
 -x 000220,000221,000222 org_mpool
Add two volumes to the backup media pool:
 # mmsadm add-volume -l library1 -o voltype=9940 \
 -x 000230,000231 bk_mpool
Write a volume label on the volume. The volume becomes owned by the engineering application. The finance or
backup applications are, as a result, not able to use the volume:
 # mmsadm label -P ~/eng_passwd -l library1 -A eng 000220
Verify that the engineering application owns the volume:
 # mmsadm label -P ~/finance_passwd -l library1 -A finance 000220
Write a volume label for the finance application:
 # mmsadm label -P ~/finance_passwd -l library1 -A finance 000221
Write a volume label for the backup application:
 # mmsadm label -P ~/backup_passwd -l library1 -A backup 000230
Mount media for the engineering, finance and backup applications. The handle returned by the mount command
<beginning of page>
will be used as a normal /dev/rmt entry:
 # mmsadm mount -P ~/eng_passwd -l library1 -A eng 000220
 # mmsadm mount -P ~/finance_passwd -l library1 -A finance 000221
 # mmsadm mount -P ~/backup_passwd -l library1 -A backup 000230
Unmount the media and unload the drives:
 # mmsadm unmount -P ~/eng_passwd -U -l library1 -A eng 000220
 # mmsadm unmount -P ~/finance_passwd -U -l library1 -A finance 000221
 # mmsadm unmount -P ~/backup_passwd -U -l library1 -A backup 000230
Example 10 Configure an MMS for Disk Archiving
The following sequence of commands configures a Media Management System for disk archiving.
Create a test application:
 # mmsadm create -t app -P ~/test_passwd test
Create a disk archiving library named dklib1:
 # mmsadm create -t library -o hwtype=DISK -o dkpath=/dskpool dklib1
Create a disk archiving media pool named dkcarts:
 # mmsadm create -t mpool -o apps=test dkcarts
Create three 100 GB volumes for disk archiving and place the volumes in the media pool:
 # mmsadm add-volume -l dklib1 -o voltype=DISK -x 000000,000001,000002 \
 -o size=100g dkcarts
Create a disk archiving drive pool named dkdrives:
 # mmsadm create -t dpool -o apps=test dkdrives
Create a disk archiving drive and place it in the drive pool:
 # mmsadm create -t drive -o hwtype=DISK -o library=dklib1 \
 -o dpool=dkdrives dkdrive1
<beginning of page>
Create volume labels. The volume will be labeled when it is mounted:
 # mmsadm label -P ~/test_passwd -n -l dklib1 -A test 000000
 # mmsadm label -P ~/test_passwd -n -l dklib1 -A test 000001
 # mmsadm label -P ~/test_passwd -n -l dklib1 -A test 000002
Mount the volume 000000. Use the returned tape handle in a subsequent tar command:
 # mmsadm mount -P ~/test_passwd -n -l dklib1 -A test 000000
Show the file sizes of the disk archiving volume before creating tar archive:
 % ls -la /dskpool/dklib1/000000
Create a disk archiving tar archive:
 # tar -cvf <mms_handle> /var > /tmp/out$$ 2>&1
Show the file sizes of the disk archiving volume after creating the tar archive:
 % ls -la /dskpool/dklib1/000000
Unmount and unload the volume from the drive:
 # mmsadm unmount -P ~/test_passwd -U -l dklib1 -A test 000000
