ldapfilter.conf <-> configuration file for LDAP filtering routines
/etc/opt/SUNWconn/ldap/current/ldapfilter.conf
The ldapfilter.conf file contains information used by the LDAP filtering routines.
Blank lines and lines that begin with a hash character (#) are treated as comments and ignored. The configuration in<hy>
formation consists of lines that contain one to five tokens. Tokens are separated by white space, and double quotes
can be used to include white space inside a token.
The file consists of a sequence of one or more filter sets. A filter set begins with a line containing a single token
called a tag.
The filter set consists of a sequence of one or more filter lists. The first line in a filter list must contain four or five to<hy>
kens: the value pattern, the delimiter list, a filtertemplate, a match description, and an optional search scope. The
value pattern is a regular expression that is matched against the value passed to the LDAP library call to select the
filter list.
The delimiter list is a list of the characters (in the form of a single string) that can be used to break the value into
distinct words.
The filter template is used to construct an LDAP filter (see description below)
The match description is returned to the caller along with a filter as a piece of text that can be used to describe the
sort of LDAP search that took place. It should correctly compete both of the following phrases: "One match descrip<hy>
tion match was found for ..." and "Three match description matches were found for...."
The search scope is optional, and should be one of base, onelevel, or subtree. If search scope is not provided, the
default is subtree.
The remaining lines of the filter list should contain two or three tokens, a filter template, a match description and an
optional search scope.
The filter template is similar in concept to a printf(3C) style format string. Everything is taken literally except for
the character sequences:
%v Substitute the entire value string in place of the %v.
%v$ Substitute the last word in this field.
%vN Substitute word N in this field (where N is a single digit 1-9). Words are numbered from left to right within the
value starting at 1.
%vM-N Substitute the indicated sequence of words where M and N are both single digits 1-9.
%vN- Substitute word N through the last word in value where N is again a single digit 1-9.
Example 1 An LDAP Filter Configuration File
The following LDAP filter configuration file contains two filter sets, example1 and example2 onelevel, each of
which contains four filter lists.
