wcsxfrm, wsxfrm <-> wide character string transformation
#include <wchar.h>
size_t wcsxfrm(wchar_t *ws1, const wchar_t *ws2, size_t n);
size_t wsxfrm(wchar_t *ws1, const wchar_t *ws2, size_t n);
The wcsxfrm() and wcsxfrm() functions transform the wide character string pointed to by ws2 and place the result<hy>
ing wide character string into the array pointed to by ws1. The transformation is such that if either the wcscmp(3C)
or wscmp(3C) functions are applied to two transformed wide strings, they return a value greater than, equal to, or
less than 0, corresponding to the result of the wcscoll(3C) or wscoll(3C) function applied to the same two original
wide character strings. No more than n wide-character codes are placed into the resulting array pointed to by ws1,
including the terminating null wide-character code. If n is 0, ws1 is permitted to be a null pointer. If copying takes
place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
The wcsxfrm() and wsxfrm() functions do not change the setting of errno if successful.
Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error, an application wishing to check for error situations should set
errno to 0, then call wcsxfrm() or wsxfrm(), then check errno.
The wcsxfrm() and wsxfrm() functions return the length of the transformed wide character string (not including the
terminating null wide-character code). If the value returned is n or more, the contents of the array pointed to by ws1
are indeterminate.
On error, wcsxfrm() and wsxfrm() may set errno but no return value is reserved to indicate an error.
The wcsxfrm() and wsxfrm() functions may fail if:
EINVAL The wide character string pointed to by ws2 contains wide-character codes outside the domain of the col<hy>
lating sequence.
The transformation function is such that two transformed wide character strings can be ordered by the wcscmp() or
wscmp() functions as appropriate to collating sequence information in the program's locale (category LC_COL<hy>
LATE).
The fact that when n is 0, ws1 is permitted to be a null pointer, is useful to determine the size of the ws1 array prior
to making the transformation.

not being called to change the locale.
