MP_SetTPGAccess <-> set a target port group access state
cc [ flag... ] file... -lMPAPI [ library... ]
#include <mpapi.h>
MP_STATUS MP_SetTPGAccess(MP_OID luOid, MP_UINT32 count,
 MP_TPG_STATE_PAIR *pTpgStateList);
luOid An object ID that has type MP_MULTIPATH_LOGICAL_UNIT.
count The number of valid items in the pTpgStateList.
pTpgStateList A pointer to an array of data structure MP_TPG_STATE_PAIR. This array must contain the same
number of elements as count.
The MP_SetTPGAccess() function sets the access state for a list of target port groups. This allows a client to force a
failover or failback to a desired set of target port groups. This is only valid for devices that support explicit access
state manipulation (i.e., the field explicitFailover of data structure MP_TARGET_PORT_GROUP_PROPERTIES
must be true).
This API provides the information needed to set up a SCSI SET TARGET PORT GROUPS command.
The plugin should not implement this API by directly calling the SCSI SET TARGET PORT GROUPS command.
The plugin should use the MP drivers API (for example, ioctl) if available.
There are two reasons why this API is restricted to devices supporting explicit failover commands. Without an ex<hy>
plicit command, the behavior of failback tends to be device-specific.
When the caller is finished using the list it must free the memory used by the list by calling MP_FreeOidList.
MP_STATUS_ACCESS_STATE_INVALID
The target device returns a status indicating the caller is attempting to establish an illegal combination of access
states.
MP_STATUS_FAILED
The underlying interface failed the command for some reason other than MP_STATUS_ACCESS_STATE_IN<hy>
VALID.
MP_STATUS_INVALID_OBJECT_TYPE
The luOid does not specify any valid object type. This is most likely to happen if an uninitialized object ID is passed
to the API.
MP_STATUS_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND
The luOid owner ID or object sequence number is invalid.
MP_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER
The pTpgStateList is null, or when one of the TPGs referenced in the list is not associated with the specified MP log<hy>
ical unit, or the luOid has a type subfield other than MP_OBJECT_TYPE_MULTIPATH_LU.
MP_STATUS_SUCCESS
The operation is successful.
