void qunbufcall(queue_t *q, bufcall_id_t id);
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
q Pointer to STREAMS queue_t structure.
id Identifier returned from qbufcall(9F).
The qunbufcall() function cancels a pending qbufcall() request. The argument id is a non-zero identifier of the re<hy>
quest to be cancelled. id is returned from the qbufcall() function used to issue the cancel request.
The qunbufcall() function is tailored to be used with the enhanced STREAMS framework interface which is based
on the concept of perimeters. (See mt-streams(9F).) qunbufcall() returns when the bufcall has been cancelled or
finished executing. The bufcall will be cancelled even if it is blocked at the perimeters associated with the queue. All
outstanding timeouts and bufcalls must be cancelled before a driver close routine can block and before the close
routine calls qprocsoff(9F).
The qunbufcall() function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context.
