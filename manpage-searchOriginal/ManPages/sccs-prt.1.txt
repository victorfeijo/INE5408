sccs-prt, prt <-> display delta table information from an SCCS file
prt [-abdefistu] [-cdate-time] [-rdate-time]
 [-ysid] s.filename...
prt prints selected portions of an SCCS file. By default, it prints the delta table (version log).
If a directory name is used in place of the s.filename argument, the prt command applies to all s.files in that directo<hy>
ry. Unreadable s.files produce an error; processing continues with the next file (if any). The use of `<mi>' as the s.file<hy>
name argument indicates that the names of files are to be read from the standard input, one s.file per line.
If any option other than -y, -c, or -r is supplied, the name of each file being processed (preceded by one NEWLINE
and followed by two NEWLINE characters) appears above its contents.
If none of the -u, -f, -t, or -b options are used, -d is assumed. -s, -i are mutually exclusive, as are -c and -r.
-a Display log entries for all deltas, including those marked as removed.
-b Print the body of the s.file.
-d Print delta table entries. This is the default.
-e Everything. This option implies -d, -i, -u, -f, and -t.
-f Print the flags of each named s.file.
-i Print the serial numbers of included, excluded, and ignored deltas.
-s Print only the first line of the delta table entries; that is, only up to the statistics.
-t Print the descriptive text contained in the s.file.
-u Print the user-names and/or numerical group IDs of users allowed to make deltas.
-cdate-time Exclude delta table entries that are specified cutoff date and time. Each entry is printed as a single line,
preceded by the name of the SCCS file. This format (also produced by -r , and -y) makes it easy to sort multiple
delta tables in chronological order. When both -y and -c, or -y and -r are supplied, prt stops printing when the first
of the two conditions is met.
-rdate-time Exclude delta table entries that are newer than the specified cutoff date and time.
-ysid Exclude delta table entries made prior to the SID specified. If no delta in the table has the specified SID, the
entire table is printed. If no SID is specified, the most recent delta is printed.
The following format is used to print those portions of the s.file that are specified by the various options. <bu> NEW<hy>
LINE <bu> Type of delta (D or R) <bu> SPACE <bu> SCCS delta ID (SID) <bu> TAB <bu> Date and time of creation in the form:
yy/mm/dd hh/mm/ss <bu> SPACE <bu> Username the delta's creator <bu> TAB <bu> Serial number of the delta <bu> SPACE <bu> Prede<hy>
cessor delta's serial number <bu> TAB <bu> Line-by-line change statistics in the form: inserted/deleted/unchanged <bu> NEW<hy>
LINE <bu> List of included deltas, followed by a NEWLINE (only if there were any such deltas and the -i options was
used) <bu> List of excluded deltas, followed by a NEWLINE (only if there were any such deltas and the -i options was
used) <bu> List of ignored deltas, followed by a NEWLINE (only if there were any such deltas and the -i options was
used) <bu> List of modification requests (MRs), followed by a NEWLINE (only if any MR numbers were supplied). <bu>
Lines of the delta commentary (if any), followed by a NEWLINE. Example 1 Producing a Display of the Delta Ta<hy>
