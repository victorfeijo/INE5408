devfs <-> Devices file system
The devfs filesystem manages a name space of all devices under the Solaris operating environment and is mounted
during boot on the /devices name space.
The /devices name space is dynamic and reflects the current state of accessible devices under the Solaris operating
environment. The names of all attached device instances are present under /devices.
The content under /devices is under the exclusive control of the devfs filesystem and cannot be changed.
The system may be configured to include a device in one of two ways:
 By means of dynamic reconfiguration (DR), using, for example, cfgadm(1M).
 For devices driven by driver.conf(4) enumeration, edit the driver.conf file to add a new entry, then use up<hy>
 date_drv(1M) to cause the system to re-read the driver.conf file and thereby enumerate the instance.
The device may be attached through a number of system calls and programs, including open(2), stat(2) and ls(1).
During device attach, the device driver typically creates minor nodes corresponding to the device via ddi_cre<hy>
ate_minor_node(9F). If the attach is successful, one or more minor nodes referring to the device are created under
/devices.
Operations like mknod(2), mkdir(2) and creat(2) are not supported in /devices.

The /devices name space cannot be unmounted.
All content at or below the /devices name space is an implementation artifact and subject to incompatible change or
removal without notification.
