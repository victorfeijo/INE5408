ftprestart <-> restart previously shutdown FTP Servers
ftprestart [-V]
Use the ftprestart command to restart an FTP Server previously shut down by means of ftpshut(1M). The ft<hy>
prestart command reads the shutdown capability from the ftpaccess(4) file to determine the path of the shutdown
message files. It then reenables the FTP Server by removing any shutdown message files in the anonymous and vir<hy>
tual FTP Server area, as well as the system wide shutdown message file.
The ftprestart command supports the following options:
-V Display program copyright and version information, then terminate.
