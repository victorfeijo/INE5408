fwtmp, wtmpfix <-> manipulate connect accounting records
/usr/lib/acct/fwtmp [-ic]
/usr/lib/acct/wtmpfix [file]...
fwtmp reads from the standard input and writes to the standard output, converting binary records of the type found
in /var/adm/wtmpx to formatted ASCII records. The ASCII version is useful when it is necessary to edit bad
records.
wtmpfix examines the standard input or named files in utmpx format, corrects the time/date stamps to make the en<hy>
tries consistent, and writes to the standard output. A hyphen (<mi>) can be used in place of file to indicate the standard
input. If time/date corrections are not performed, acctcon(1M) will fault when it encounters certain date-change
records.
Each time the date is set, a pair of date change records are written to /var/adm/wtmpx. The first record is the old
date denoted by the string "old time" placed in the line field and the flag OLD_TIME placed in the type field of the
utmpx structure. The second record specifies the new date and is denoted by the string new time placed in the line
field and the flag NEW_TIME placed in the type field. wtmpfix uses these records to synchronize all time stamps
in the file.
In addition to correcting time/date stamps, wtmpfix will check the validity of the name field to ensure that it con<hy>
sists solely of alphanumeric characters or spaces. If it encounters a name that is considered invalid, it will change the
login name to INVALID and write a diagnostic to the standard error. In this way, wtmpfix reduces the chance that
acctcon will fail when processing connect accounting records.
-ic Denotes that input is in ASCII form, and output is to be written in binary form.
