The named-checkconf utility checks the syntax, but not the semantics, of a named configuration file.

if run by a named configuration whose root directory has been similarly changed.
-v Print the version of the named-checkconf program and exit.
-z Perform a test load of the master zones found in named.conf.
-j When loading a zonefile, read the journal if it exists.
The following operands are supported:
