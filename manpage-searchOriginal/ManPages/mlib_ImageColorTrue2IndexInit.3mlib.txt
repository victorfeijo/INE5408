mlib_status mlib_ImageColorTrue2IndexInit(void **colormap, mlib_s32 bits,
 mlib_type intype, mlib_type outtype, mlib_s32 channels,
 mlib_s32 entries, mlib_s32 offset, const void **table);
The mlib_ImageColorTrue2IndexInit() function creates and initializes an internal data structure based on the input
lookup table and other parameters for inverse color mapping.
The lookup table can have either three or four channels. The number of channels of the lookup table should match
that of the source image provided to the function that will use the colormap structure created by this function.
The type of the lookup table can be one of the following:
 MLIB_BYTE in, MLIB_BYTE out (i.e., BYTE-to-BYTE)
 MLIB_SHORT in, MLIB_SHORT out (i.e., SHORT-to-SHORT)
 MLIB_SHORT in, MLIB_BYTE out (i.e., SHORT-to-BYTE)
The input type of the lookup table should match the type of the destination image; the output type of the lookup ta<hy>
ble should match the source image type. The source and destination images are the images provided to the function
that is going to use the colormap structure created by mlib_ImageColorTrue2IndexInit() to do inverse color map<hy>
ping.
The function takes the following arguments:
colormap Internal data structure for inverse color mapping.
bits Number of bits per color component used in the colorcube of the colormap structure. (If bits = 0, then no color<hy>
cube is created. But the inverse color mapping might be done by using the original lookup table.)
intype Data type of the source image and lookup table.
outtype Data type of the destination indexed image.
channels Number of channels of the lookup table.
entries Number of entries of the lookup table.
offset The first entry offset of the lookup table.
table The lookup table (LUT).
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
