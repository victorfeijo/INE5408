This command is deprecated. Use the smpatch set, smpatch unset, and smpatch get commands instead. See the
smpatch(1M) man page.
Use the pprosetup command, as superuser, to configure your patch management environment by doing the follow<hy>
ing: <bu> Scheduling the patch operations <bu> Setting a patch policy <bu> Specifying patch directories <bu> Specifying the hard<hy>
ware on the system <bu> Specifying alternate configurations
Schedule the automatic synchronization of patches with Sun's patch base. This scheduling makes the pprosvc com<hy>
mand run in automatic mode. This mode is set up by using the cron interface. Use the -C, -D, -M, -s, and -W op<hy>
tions to perform the scheduling tasks.
If you do not want to schedule patch operations, you can run the pprosvc and smpatch commands in manual mode,
which means running the tool from the command line.
Note that midnight is represented as 00:00. Note -
The smpatch command does not directly support this mechanism for scheduling patch operations. You can set up a
schedule by using cron to run smpatch in local mode. See the smpatch(1M) man page.
Patches are classified as being standard or nonstandard. A standard patch can be applied by pprosvc in automatic
mode. Such a patch is associated with the standard patch property. A nonstandard patch is one that has one of the
following characteristics: <bu> A patch that is associated with the rebootafter, rebootimmediate, reconfigafter, recon<hy>
figimmediate, or singleuser properties. This nonstandard patch can be applied by running the pprosvc command or
the smpatch command in manual mode. <bu> A patch that is associated with the interactive property. Such a patch
cannot be applied by using the smpatch command.
Use pprosetup to schedule patch operations to run in automatic mode. Patches are applied based on the policy,
which you can set by running pprosetup.
Use pprosetup -p to specify the types of patches to apply in automatic mode. You can set a policy to apply no
patches (none) or standard patches (standard).
Use pprosetup -i to specify the types of patches to apply in manual mode. Such patches might include those that re<hy>
quire a reboot and those that must be applied while the system is in single-user mode. Specify the types of patches
that can be applied by using the following command:
 # pprosetup -i patch-property-list
patch-property-list is a colon-separated list of one or more of the following patch properties:
interactive A patch that cannot be applied by running the usual patch management tools (pprosvc, smpatch, or
patchadd). Before this patch is applied, the user must perform special actions. Such actions might include checking
the serial number of a disk drive, stopping a critical daemon, or reading the patch's README file.
rebootafter The effects of this patch are not visible until after the system is rebooted.
rebootimmediate When this patch is applied, the system becomes unstable until the system is rebooted. An unstable
system is one in which the behavior is unpredictable and data might be lost.
<beginning of page>
reconfigafter The effects of this patch are not visible until after a reconfiguration reboot (boot -r). See the boot(1M)
man page.
reconfigimmediate When this patch is applied, the system becomes unstable until the system gets a reconfiguration
reboot (boot -r). An unstable system is one in which the behavior is unpredictable and data might be lost.
singleuser Do not apply this patch while the system is in multiuser mode. You must apply this patch on a quiet sys<hy>
tem with no network traffic and with extremely restricted I/O activity.
standard This patch can be applied while the system is in multiuser mode. The effects of the patch are visible as
soon as it is applied unless the application being patched is running while the patch is applied. In this case, the ef<hy>
fects of the patch are visible after the affected application is restarted.
Note -
The smpatch command only supports the patch policy for manual mode.
Use the following options to specify the directories in which to store patch-related data: <bu> Use the -b option to speci<hy>
fy the directory in which to store backout data. During a patch backout operation, the data is retrieved from this di<hy>
rectory to restore the system to its state prior to applying the patch. <bu> Use the -d option to specify the download di<hy>
rectory in which to store patches that are downloaded from the Sun patch server. This directory is also the location
from which patches are applied. <bu> Use the -q option to specify the directory in which to store patches that cannot be
applied automatically. Such patches are called sequestered patches. Note -
The sequester directory is not used by the smpatch command.
Use the -H option to run a program that helps you determine the hardware that is attached to the host system, such as
firmware, disk array systems, and tape storage systems.
Use this option to select the hardware that applies to this system. Select the sequence number of the specific hard<hy>
ware. A confirmation page lists the selections.
Save the specified hardware configuration information to a file. Then, the system responds by performing the appro<hy>
priate actions. Note -
The smpatch command does not support this feature for specifying hardware on your system.
The pprosetup command uses a configuration file to specify the collection of patches with which to perform patch
operations. By default, all of the patches from the Sun patch server are available for patch operations.
The -c option enables you to specify an alternate configuration.
Sun currently provides one alternate configuration, which is called the recommended configuration. This configura<hy>
tion includes only those patches that have been declared significant. Such patches include security patches and
patches that address known performance and availability problems.
You can use the -c recommended option when you schedule patch operations. For example, the following command
schedules monthly patch operations that use the recommended configuration:
 # pprosetup -c recommended -M 15 -s 23:30
To cancel a schedule that uses the recommended configuration, type:
 # pprosetup -c recommended -C
You are permitted to modify the recommended configuration by using the -c option. See EXAMPLES. Note -
The smpatch command does not support this feature for specifying alternate configurations.
<beginning of page>
The following options are supported:
-a admin-email-addr
Is the email address of the patch administrator. Email notification is sent to describe the patches downloaded, the
patches applied, and any error events that occurred when running the pprosvc -i -n command. Note -
This option does not affect the smpatch command.
-b backout-dir
Stores backout data in the specified directory.
The backout data is used whenever you use the patchrm command to remove a patch that has already been applied
to your system. The data is used to restore a system to the state it was in before you applied a particular patch. Since
backout data might be quite large, store the data in a large partition that holds large transitory data. Such a partition
might be /var.
If you do not specify the -b option, the backout data is stored in the default locations used by patchadd. These loca<hy>
tions are the save directories of the packages that were modified by the patch. For example, if a patch modifies the
SUNWcsr package, the backout data for that package is stored in the /var/sadm/pkg/SUNWcsr/save directory.
To specify the backout directory, use the smpatch set command to set the patchpro.backout.directory parameter.
Note -
The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced with the -b option. Doing so might damage the
global zone's file system, might compromise the security of the global zone, and might damage the non-global
zone's file system. See zones(5).
-C
Clears the existing patch service schedule. Note -
This feature is not supported by the smpatch command.
-c config-name
Uses the config-name configuration for patch operations. When this option is included in any pprosetup command,
the entire command applies to the specified configuration. Note -
This feature is not supported by the smpatch command.
-d patch-dir
Is the directory in which to download the patches that are appropriate for this host system. This directory is also the
location from which patches are applied. By default, the download directory is /var/sadm/spool. Note -
To specify the download directory, use the smpatch set command to set the patchpro.download.directory parame<hy>
ter.
-D
Schedules the automatic analysis, download, and optional application of patches on a daily basis. This option is
equivalent to executing the pprosvc -i -n command on a daily basis. See the crontab(1) man page.
The policy defined by the -p option determines whether no patches (pprosetup -p none) are applied or whether
standard patches (pprosetup -p standard) are applied. By default, no patches are applied.
This option is mutually exclusive with the -M option and the -W option. Note -
This feature is not supported by the smpatch command.
<beginning of page>
-h
Displays information about command-line options.
-H
Establishes a dialog with the user to determine what hardware is attached to the host system. Note -
This feature is not supported by the smpatch command.
-i [none | patch-property-list]
Specifies the policy for applying patches in manual mode.
No patches are applied when none is specified. patch-property-list is a colon-separated list of one or more of the fol<hy>
lowing patch properties: interactive, rebootafter, rebootimmediate, reconfigafter, reconfigimmediate, sin<hy>
gleuser, and standard. See Setting a Patch Policy. Note -
To specify the patch policy, use the smpatch set command to set the patchpro.install.types parameter.
-L
Displays the configuration parameter settings of your patch management environment.
This option is mutually exclusive with the other options. Note -
To view the configuration parameter settings, use the smpatch get command.
-M day-of-month
Schedules the automatic analysis, download, and optional application of patches on a monthly basis.
The policy defined by the -p option determines whether no patches (pprosetup -p none) are applied or whether
standard patches (pprosetup -p standard) are applied. By default, no patches are applied.
day-of-month is a numerical value from 1-28, which represents the day of the month. Note that the values 29, 30,
and 31 are invalid. See the crontab(1) man page.
This option is mutually exclusive with the -D option and the -W option. Note -
This feature is not supported by the smpatch command.
-p [none | standard]
Specifies the policy for applying patches in automatic mode.
No patches are applied when none, the default, is specified.
When standard is specified, only standard patches are applied. Note -
This feature is not supported by the smpatch command.
-P patch-source-url
Is the URL that points to the collection of patches. The default is the Sun patch server, which has the following
URL:
 https://updateserver.sun.com/solaris/
Note -
To specify the URL that points to the collection of patches, use the smpatch set command to set the patch<hy>
<beginning of page>
pro.patch.source parameter.
-q sequester-dir
Is the directory in which patches are moved if they cannot be automatically applied. By default, the sequester direc<hy>
tory is /var/sadm/spool/patchproSequester. Note -
The sequester directory is not used by the smpatch command.
-s hh:mm
Optionally sets the time of day to perform patch operations, which by default, is midnight local time.
hh is a value from 00-23, which specifies the hour. mm is a value from 00-59, which specifies the minute.
Use this option with the -D, -M, and -W options. Note -
This feature is not supported by the smpatch command.
-u user-name
Is the user name with which to obtain contract patches from Sun.
Store the corresponding SunSpectrum user's password in the lib/.sunsolvepw file. If PatchPro is installed in the de<hy>
fault location, this file is in the /opt/SUNWppro directory.
Keep the password safe by setting the owner, group, and permissions to root, sys, and 0600, respectively. Note -
This file method of supplying passwords is no longer supported. Note -
To specify this user, use the smpatch set command to set the patchpro.sun.user parameter. Also, specify this user's
password by setting the patchpro.sun.passwd parameter.
-U proxy-user-name
Is the user name required for authentication of the web proxy, if applicable.
Store the corresponding user's password in the lib/.proxypw file. If PatchPro is installed in the default location, this
file is in the /opt/SUNWppro directory.
Keep the password safe by setting the owner, group, and permissions to root, sys, and 0600, respectively. Note -
This file method of supplying passwords is no longer supported. Note -
To specify this user, use the smpatch set command to set the patchpro.proxy.user parameter. Also, specify this us<hy>
er's password by setting the patchpro.proxy.passwd parameter.
-W day-of-week
Schedules the automatic analysis, download, and optional application of patches on a weekly basis.
day-of-week is a numerical value from 0-6, which represents the day of the week. 0 represents Sunday. See the
crontab(1) man page.
The policy defined by the -p option determines whether no patches (pprosetup -p none) are applied or whether
standard patches (pprosetup -p standard) are applied. By default, no patches are applied.
This option is mutually exclusive with the -D option and the -M option. Note -
This feature is not supported by the smpatch command.
<beginning of page>
-x [host:port]
Specifies the web proxy. If your system is behind a firewall, use this option to specify your web proxy. Get the name
of the web proxy and its port from your system administrator or network administrator. Note -
To specify the web proxy host name and port, use the smpatch set command to set the patchpro.proxy.host and
patchpro.proxy.port parameters, respectively.
Example 1 Scheduling Daily Patch Operations in Automatic Mode
 # pprosetup -D
Schedules smpatch update to run in automatic mode daily at midnight local time.
Example 2 Scheduling Weekly Patch Operations in Automatic Mode
