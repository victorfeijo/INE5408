pcata <-> PCMCIA ATA card device driver
pcata@socket#:a -u
pcata@socket#:a -u,raw
The PCMCIA ATA card device driver supports PCMCIA ATA disk and flash cards that follow the following stan<hy>
dards: <bu> PC card 2.01 compliance (MBR+fdisk table required for all platforms). <bu> PC card ATA 2.01 compliance. <bu>
PC card services 2.1 compliance.
The driver supports standard PCMCIA ATA cards that contain a Card Information Structure (CIS). For PCMCIA,
nodes are created in /devices that include the socket number as one component of the device name referred to by the
node. However, the names in /dev, /dev/dsk, and /dev/rdsk follow the current conventions for ATA devices, which
do not encode the socket number in any part of the name. For example, you may have the following:
tab() box; lw(1.49i) |lw(2.08i) |lw(1.93i) lw(1.49i) |lw(2.08i) |lw(1.93i) Platform/devices name/dev/dsk name _
x86/devices/isa/pcic@1,3e0 /disk@0:a/dev/dsk/c1d0s0 _ SPARCT{ /devices/iommu@f,e0000000
/sbus@f,e0001000 /SUNW, pcmcia@3,0 /disk@0:a T}/dev/dsk/c1d0s0
If a PC Card ATA device is recognized, the pcata driver is automatically loaded, IRQs allocated, devices nodes creat<hy>
ed, and special files created (if they do not already exist). <bu> You need to umount the file system before removing the
disk. <bu> The ufs file systems on removable media (PC Card ATA) should have one of the onerror={panic, lock,
umount} mount options set.
Configuration topics include initial installation and configuration, identifying an unrecognized device, special files
and hot-plugging. 1. Install the Solaris software. 2. Boot the system. 3. Insert the PC card ATA device.
If you insert a PC card ATA device and it is not recognized (no special files created), use the prtconf command to
identify the problem. 1. Run the prtconf -D command to see if your pcata card is recognized. (A recognized de<hy>
vice will appear at the end of the prtconf output. For example:
 # prtconf -D
 . . .
 pcic, instance #0 (driver name: pcic)
  . . .
  disk, instance #0
2. If pcata does not appear in the prtconf output, there is a problem with the PC card adapter configuration or with
the hardware. Check to see whether the problem is with the card or the adapter by trying to use the card on another
machine and by seeing if it works on the same machine using DOS.
For PC card devices, nodes are created in /devices that include the socket number as one component of a device
name that the node refers to. However, the /prtc/dev names and the names in /dev/dsk and /dev/rdsk do follow the
current convention for ATA devices, which do not encode the socket number in any part of the name. <bu> If you want
to remove the disk, you must unmount the file system. <bu> Use the mkfs_pcfs(1M) command to create a pcfs file sys<hy>
tem:
 # mkfs -F pcfs /dev/rdsk/c#d#p0:d
<bu> To mount a pcfs file system, type:
 # mount -F pcfs /dev/dsk/c#d#p0:c /mnt
<bu> If you want to create a ufs file system, use the newfs command and type:
 # newfs /dev/rdsk/c#d#s#
<bu> To mount a ufs file system, type:
 # mount -F ufs /dev/dsk/c#d#s# /mnt
<bu> To create a Solaris partition, run the format command and go to the Partition menu. For more information, see the
format(1M) man page.
