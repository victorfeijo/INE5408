mlib_status mlib_VideoDCT16x16_S16_S16_B10(mlib_s16 coeffs[256],
 const mlib_s16 block[256]);
The mlib_VideoDCT16x16_S16_S16_B10() function computes the forward DCT for the destination DCT coeffi<hy>
cients of data type mlib_s16 and source block of data type mlib_s16. The input to the DCT routine is the difference
between the current block and the reference block. The difference pixel which can occupy 10 bits, is represented as a
16-bit data.
The function takes the following arguments:
coeffs Pointer to the output DCT coefficients. Note that coeffs must be 8-byte aligned.
block Pointer to a 16x16 motion-compensated block which is the difference between the reference block and the cur<hy>
rent block. Note that block must be 8-byte aligned.
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
