#include <cwchar>
wchar_t *std::wmemchr(wchar_t *ws, wchar_t wc, size_t n);
The wmemchr() function locates the first occurrence of wc in the initial n wide-characters of the object pointed to
be ws. This function is not affected by locale and all wchar_t values are treated identically. The null wide-character
and wchar_t values not corresponding to valid characters are not treated specially.
If n is 0, ws must be a valid pointer and the function behaves as if no valid occurrence of wc is found.
The wmemchr() function returns a pointer to the located wide-character, or a null pointer if the wide-character does
not occur in the object.
No errors are defined.
