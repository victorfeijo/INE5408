nslookup <-> query Internet name servers interactively
nslookup [-option] [name | -] [server]
The nslookup utility is a program to query Internet domain name servers. It has two modes: interactive and non-in<hy>
teractive. Interactive mode allows the user to query name servers for information about various hosts and domains or
to print a list of hosts in a domain. Non-interactive mode is used to print just the name and requested information for
a host or domain.
Interactive mode is entered in the following cases: 1. No arguments are given (the default name server is used). 2.
The first argument is a hyphen (-) and the second argument is the host name or Internet address of a name server.
Non-interactive mode is used when the name or Internet address of the host to be looked up is given as the first argu<hy>
ment. The optional second argument specifies the host name or address of a name server.
Options can also be specified on the command line if they precede the arguments and are prefixed with a hyphen.
For example, to change the default query type to host information, and the initial timeout to 10 seconds, type:
 nslookup -query=hinfo -timeout=10
host [server]
Look up information for host using the current default server or using server, if specified. If host is an Internet ad<hy>
dress and the query type is A or PTR, the name of the host is returned. If host is a name and does not have a trailing
period, the search list is used to qualify the name. To look up a host not in the current domain, append a period to
the name.
server domain
lserver domain
Change the default server to domain; lserver uses the initial server to look up information about domain, while serv<hy>
er uses the current default server. If an authoritative answer can't be found, the names of servers that might have the
answer are returned.

is also printed.
class=value
Change the query class to one of:
IN
the Internet class
CH
the Chaos class
HS
the Hesiod class
ANY
wildcard
The class specifies the protocol group of the information.
(Default = IN; abbreviation = cl)
[no]debug
Turn on or off the display of the full response packet and any intermediate response packets when searching.
(Default = nodebug; abbreviation = [no]deb)
[no]d2
Turn debugging mode on or off. This displays more about what nslookup is doing.
(Default = nod2)
domain=name
Sets the search list to name.
[no]search
If the lookup request contains at least one period but doesn't end with a trailing period, append the domain names in
the domain search list to the request until an answer is received.
(Default = search)

port=value
Change the default TCP/UDP name server port to value.
(Default = 53; abbreviation = po)
querytype=value
type=value
Change the top of the information query.
(Default = A; abbreviations = q, ty)
[no]recurse
Tell the name server to query other servers if it does not have the information. (Default = recurse; abbreviation =
[no]rec)
retry=number
Set the number of retries to number.

dig(1M), host(1M), named(1M), attributes(5)
nslookup and dig(1M) now report "Not Implemented" as NOTIMP rather than NOTIMPL. This will have impact
on scripts that are looking for NOTIMPL.
BIND 9 nslookup is deprecated and not as full featured as its former BIND 8 version. For more features and func<hy>
tionality refer to dig(1M).
