int isunordered(real-floating x, real-floating y);
The isunordered() macro determines whether its arguments are unordered.
Upon successful completion, the isunordered() macro returns 1 if its arguments are unordered and 0 otherwise.
No errors are defined.
The relational and equality operators support the usual mathematical relationships between numeric values. For any
ordered pair of numeric values, exactly one of the relationships (less, greater, and equal) is true. Relational operators
can raise the invalid floating-point exception when argument values are NaNs. For a NaN and a numeric value, or for
two NaNs, just the unordered relationship is true. This macro is a quiet (non-floating-point exception raising) version
of a relational operator. It facilitates writing efficient code that accounts for quiet NaNs without suffering the invalid
floating-point exception. In the SYNOPSIS section, real-floating indicates that the argument shall be an expression
of real-floating type.
