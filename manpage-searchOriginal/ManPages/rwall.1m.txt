rwall <-> write to all users over a network

/usr/sbin/rwall -h hostname -n netgroup
rwall reads a message from standard input until EOF. It then sends this message, preceded by the line:

Broadcast Message ...
to all users logged in on the specified host machines. With the -n option, it sends to the specified network groups.
-n netgroup Send the broadcast message to the specified network groups.
-h hostname Specify the hostname, the name of the host machine.

The timeout is fairly short to allow transmission to a large group of machines (some of which may be down) in a
reasonable amount of time. Thus the message may not get through to a heavily loaded machine.
