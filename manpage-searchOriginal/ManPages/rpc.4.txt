rpc <-> rpc program number data base
/etc/rpc
The rpc file is a local source containing user readable names that can be used in place of RPC program numbers.
The rpc file can be used in conjunction with or instead of other rpc sources, including the NIS maps ``rpc.byname''
and ``rpc.bynumber'' and the NIS+ table ``rpc''.
The rpc file has one line for each RPC program name. The line has the following format:
 name-of-the-RPC-program RPC-program-number aliases
Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters. A ``#'' indicates the beginning of a comment;
characters up to the end of the line are not interpreted by routines which search the file. Example 1 RPC Database
