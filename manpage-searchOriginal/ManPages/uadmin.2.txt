uadmin <-> administrative control
#include <sys/uadmin.h>
int uadmin(int cmd, int fcn, uintptr_t mdep);
The uadmin() function provides control for basic administrative functions. This function is tightly coupled to the
system administrative procedures and is not intended for general use. The argument mdep is provided for machine-
dependent use and is not defined here. It should be initialized to NULL if not used.
As specified by cmd, the following commands are available:
A_SHUTDOWN The system is shut down. All user processes are killed, the buffer cache is flushed, and the root file
system is unmounted. The action to be taken after the system has been shut down is specified by fcn. The functions
are generic; the hardware capabilities vary on specific machines.
AD_HALT Halt the processor(s).
AD_POWEROFF Halt the processor(s) and turn off the power.
AD_BOOT Reboot the system, using the kernel file.
AD_IBOOT Interactive reboot; user is prompted for bootable program name.
AD_FASTREBOOT Bypass BIOS and boot loader
A_REBOOT The system stops immediately without any further processing. The action to be taken next is specified
by fcn as above.
A_DUMP The system is forced to panic immediately without any further processing and a crash dump is written to
the dump device (see dumpadm(1M)). The action to be taken next is specified by fcn, as above.
A_REMOUNT The root file system is mounted again after having been fixed. This should be used only during the
startup process.
A_FREEZE Suspend the whole system. The system state is preserved in the state file. The following subcom<hy>
mands, specified by fcn, are available.
AD_SUSPEND_TO_DISK
Save the system state to the state file. This subcommand is equivalent to ACPI state S4.
AD_CHECK_SUSPEND_TO_DISK
Check if your system supports suspend to disk. Without performing a system suspend/resume, this subcommand
checks if this feature is currently available on your system.
AD_SUSPEND_TO_RAM
Save the system state to memory This subcommand is equivalent to ACPI state S3.
AD_CHECK_SUSPEND_TO_RAM
Check if your system supports suspend to memory. Without performing a system suspend/resume, this subcommand
checks if this feature is currently available on your system.
<beginning of page>
The following subcommands, specified by fcn, are obsolete and might be removed in a subsequent release:
AD_COMPRESS
Save the system state to the state file with compression of data. This subcommand has been replaced by AD_SUS<hy>
PEND_TO_DISK, which should be used instead.
AD_CHECK
Check if your system supports suspend and resume. Without performing a system suspend/resume, this command
checks if this feature is currently available on your system. This subcommand has been replaced by
AD_CHECK_SUSPEND_TO_DISK, which should be used instead.
AD_FORCE
Force AD_COMPRESS even when threads of user applications are not suspendable. This subcommand should nev<hy>
er be used, as it might result in undefined behavior.
Upon successful completion, the value returned depends on cmd as follows:
A_SHUTDOWN Never returns.
A_REBOOT Never returns.
A_FREEZE 0 upon resume.
A_REMOUNT 0.
Otherwise, <mi>1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
The uadmin() function will fail if:
EBUSY Suspend is already in progress.
EINVAL The cmd argument is invalid.
ENOMEM Suspend/resume ran out of physical memory.
ENOSPC Suspend/resume could not allocate enough space on the root file system to store system information.
ENOTSUP Suspend/resume is not supported on this platform or the command specified by cmd is not allowed.
ENXIO Unable to successfully suspend system.
EPERM The {PRIV_SYS_CONFIG} privilege is not asserted in the effective set of the calling process.

The A_FREEZE command and its subcommands are Committed.
dumpadm(1M), halt(1M), kernel(1M), reboot(1M), uadmin(1M), attributes(5), privileges(5)
Shutting down or halting the system by means of uadmin(1M) does not update the boot archive. Avoid using
this command after <bu> editing of files such as /etc/system <bu> installing new driver binaries or kernel binaries <bu> updating
existing driver binaries or kernel binaries.
Use reboot(1M) or halt(1M) instead.
