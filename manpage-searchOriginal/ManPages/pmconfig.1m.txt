pmconfig <-> Configure the Power Management system
/usr/sbin/pmconfig [-r]
The pmconfig utility sets the Power Management and suspend-resume configuration. User has permission to
change Power Management configuration using pmconfig only if he is allowed to do so according to PM<hy>
CHANGEPERM keyword of /etc/default/power. User has permission to change the suspend-resume configura<hy>
tion using pmconfig only if he is allowed to do so according to the CPRCHANGEPERM keyword of /etc/de<hy>
fault/power. See FILES section below for a description of the PMCHANGEPERM and CPRCHANGEPERM
keywords of /etc/default/power.
Based on user permissions, pmconfig first resets the Power Management and/or suspend-resume state back to its
default and then reads the new Power Management and/or suspend-resume configuration from /etc/power.conf
and issues the commands to activiate the new configuration. The pmconfig utility is run at system boot. This utility
can also be run from the command line after manual changes have been made to the /etc/power.conf file. For editing
changes made to the /etc/power.conf file to take effect, users must run pmconfig.
The preferred interface for changing Power Management and suspend-resume configuration is dtpower(1M).
The following options are supported:
-r
 Reset Power Management and suspend-resume state to default and exit. User must have both Power Management
and suspend-resume configuration permission for this option.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Upon successful completion
>0 An error occurred

Using Power Management
The pmconfig service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/system/power:default
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). The service's status can be queried using the svcs(1) command.
If the program cannot open the configuration file, it prints an error message to standard error. If the program encoun<hy>
ters a syntax error in the configuration file, it prints an error message and the line number of the error in the configu<hy>
ration file. It then skips the rest of the information on that line and processes the next line. Any configuration infor<hy>
mation already processed on the line containing the error is used. If user does not have permission to change Power
Management and/or suspend-resume configuration, and configuration file has entries for which user doesn't have
permission, it process the entries for which user has permissions and prints error on rest.
