 mlib_s32 cmask);
In the mlib_ImageChannelInsert() function, all N channels in the source image are copied into the selected chan<hy>
nels in the destination image, where N is the number of channels in the source image. If more than N channels are
selected, then the leftmost N channels are inserted. If less than N channels are selected, then the function returns
failure status. The channel mask is defined with respect to the destination image. The data type of the image can be
MLIB_BYTE, MLIB_SHORT, MLIB_USHORT, MLIB_INT, MLIB_FLOAT, or MLIB_DOUBLE.
The function takes the following arguments:
dst Pointer to a destination image.
src Pointer to a source image.
cmask Source or destination channel selection mask. Each bit of the mask represents a channel in the image data.
The least significant bit (LSB) of the mask corresponds to the last channel in the image data. A bit with a value of 1
indicates that the channel is selected.
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
