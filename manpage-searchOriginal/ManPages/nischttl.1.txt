nischttl <-> change the time to live value of a NIS+ object
nischttl [-AfLP] time name...
nischttl changes the time to live value (ttl) of the NIS+ objects or entries specified by name to time. Entries are
specified using indexed names (see nismatch(1)).
The time to live value is used by object caches to expire objects within their cache. When an object is read into the
cache, this value is added to the current time in seconds yielding the time when the cached object would expire. The
object may be returned from the cache until the current time is earlier than the calculated expiration time. When the
expiration time has been reached, the object will be flushed from the cache.
The time to live time may be specified in seconds or in days, hours, minutes, seconds format. The latter format uses
a suffix letter of d, h, m, or s to identify the units of time. See the examples below for usage.
The command will fail if the master NIS+ server is not running.
Setting a high ttl value allows objects to stay persistent in caches for a longer period of time and can improve per<hy>
formance. However, when an object changes, in the worst case, the number of seconds in this attribute must pass be<hy>
fore that change is visible to all clients. Setting a ttl value of 0 means that the object should not be cached at all.
A high ttl value is a week, a low value is less than a minute. Password entries should have ttl values of about 12
hours (easily allows one password change per day), entries in the RPC table can have ttl values of several weeks
(this information is effectively unchanging).
Only directory and group objects are cached in this implementation.
The following options are supported:
-A Modify all tables in the concatenation path that match the search criterion specified in name. This option implies
the -P switch.
-f Force the operation and fail silently if it does not succeed.
-L Follow links and change the time to live of the linked object or entries rather than the time to live of the link it<hy>
self.
-P Follow the concatenation path within a named table. This option only makes sense when either name is an in<hy>
dexed name or the -L switch is also specified and the named object is a link pointing to entries.
Example 1 Changing the ttl of an Object
The following example shows how to change the ttl of an object using the seconds format and the days, hours, min<hy>
utes, seconds format. The ttl of the second object is set to 1 day and 12 hours.
 example% nischttl 184000 object
 example% nischttl 1d12h object
Example 2 Changing the ttl for a password Entry
This example shows how to change the ttl for a password entry.
 example% nischttl 1h30m '[uid=99],passwd.org_dir'
Example 3 Changing the ttl of Entries Pointed to by a Link
The next two examples change the ttl of the object or entries pointed to by a link, and the ttl of all entries in the
hobbies table.

NIS_PATH If this variable is set, and the NIS+ name is not fully qualified, each directory specified will be searched
until the object is found. See nisdefaults(1).
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful operation.
1 Operation failed.

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
NIS+ to LDAP are available in the current Solaris release. For more information, visit http://www.sun.com/directo<hy>
