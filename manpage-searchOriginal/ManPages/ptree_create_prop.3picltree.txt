int ptree_create_prop(ptree_propinfo_t *pinfo, void *valbuf,
 picl_prophdl_t *proph);
int ptree_destroy_prop(picl_prophdl_t proph);
The ptree_create_prop() function creates a property using the information specified in pinfo, which includes the
name, type, access mode, and size of the property, as well as the read access function for a volatile property. The val<hy>
ue of the property is specified in the buffer valbuf, which may be NULL for volatile properties. The handle of the
property created is copied into the location given by proph. See libpicltree(3PICLTREE) for more information on
the structure of ptree_propinfo_t structure.
The ptree_destroy_prop() function destroys the property specified by the handle proph. For a table property, the
entire table is destroyed. The property to be destroyed must have been previously deleted.
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. On failure, a non-negative integer is returned to indicate an error.
PICL_STALEHANDLE is returned if the handle is no longer valid. This occurs if the PICL tree was refreshed or
reinitialized.
PICL_INVALIDHANDLE is returned if the specified handle never existed.
PICL_NOTSUPPORTED Property version not supported
PICL_VALUETOOBIG Value exceeds maximum size
PICL_NOTPROP Not a property
PICL_CANTDESTROY Attempting to destroy before delete
PICL_RESERVEDNAME Property name is reserved
PICL_INVREFERENCE Invalid reference property value
PICL_INVALIDHANDLE Invalid handle
PICL_STALEHANDLE Stale handle
PICL_FAILURE General system failure
