tokenmt <-> Single and Two Rate Three Conformance Level Meter
The tokenmt module can be configured as a Single or a Two Rate meter. Packets are deemed to belong to one of the
three levels - Red, Yellow or Green - depending on the configured rate(s) and the burst sizes. When configured as a
Single Rate meter, tokenmt can operate with just the Green and Red levels.
Configuration parameters for tokenmt correspond to definitions in RFC- 2697 and RFC- 2698 as follows:
Configuring tokenmt as a Single Rate meter (from RFC- 2697):
 committed_rate - CIR
 committed_burst - CBS
 peak_burst - EBS
(thus 'peak_burst' for a single rate meter is actually the 'excess burst' in the RFC. However, throughout the text the
parameter name "peak burst" is used.)
Configuring tokenmt as a Two Rate meter (from RFC- 2698):
 committed_rate - CIR
 peak_rate - PIR
 committed_burst - CBS
 peak_burst - PBS
The meter is implemented using token buckets C and P, which initially hold tokens equivalent to committed and
peak burst sizes (bits) respectively. When a packet of size B bits arrive at time t, the following occurs:
 When operating as a Single Rate meter, the outcome (level)
 is decided as follows:
  - Update tokens in C and P
  o Compute no. of tokens accumulated since the
  last time packet was seen at the committed rate as
  T(t) = committed rate * (t - t')
  (where t' is the time the last packet was seen)
  o Add T tokens to C up to a maximum of committed burst
  size. Add remaining tokens ((C+T) - Commited Burst),
  if any, to P, to a maximum of peak burst size.
  - Decide outcome
  o If not color aware
  o If B <= C, outcome is GREEN and C -= B.
  o Else, if B <= P, outcome is YELLOW and P -= B.
  o Else, outcome is Red.
  o Else,
  o obtain DSCP from packet
  o obtain color from color_map, color_map[DSCP]
  o if (color is GREEN) and (B <= C), outcome is
  GREEN and C -= B.
  o Else, if (color is GREEN or YELLOW) and
  (B <= P), outcome is YELLOW and P -= B.
  o Else, outcome is RED.
  Note that if peak_burst and yellow_next_actions are
  not specified (that is, a single rate meter with two
  outcomes), the outcome is never YELLOW.
When operating as a Two Rate meter, the outcome (level) is decided as follows:
 - Update tokens in C and P
  o Compute no. of tokens accumulated since the last time a
  packet was seen at the committed and peak rates as
  Tc(t) = committed rate * (t - t')
  Tp(t) = peak rate * (t - t')
  (where t' is the time the last packet was seen)
  o Add Tc to C up to a maximum of committed burst size
  o Add Tp to P up to a maximum of peak burst size
  - Decide outcome
  o If not color aware
  o If B > P, outcome is RED.
<beginning of page>
  o Else, if B > C, outcome is YELLOW and P -= B
  o Else, outcome is GREEN and C -= B & P -= B
  o Else,
  o obtain DSCP from packet
  o obtain color from color_map, color_map[DSCP]
  o if (color is RED) or (B > P), outcome is RED
  o Else, if (color is YELLOW) or (B > C),
  outcome is YELLOW and P -= B
  o Else, outcome is GREEN and C -= B & P -= B
The tokenmt module exports the following statistics through kstat:
Global statistics:
 module: tokenmt instance: <action id>
  name: tokenmt statistics class <action name>
  epackets <number of packets in error>
  green_bits <number of bits in green>
  green_packets <number of packets in green>
  red_bits <number of bits in red>
  red_packets <number of packets in red>
  yellow_bits <number of bits in yellow>
  yellow packets <number of packets in yellow>
