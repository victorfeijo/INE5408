SolarisTM Trusted Extensions software is a specific configuration of the Solaris Operating System (Solaris OS). So<hy>
laris Trusted Extensions (Trusted Extensions) provides labels for local objects and processes, for the desktop and
windowing system, for zones and file systems, and for network communications. These labels are used to implement
a Multilevel Security (MLS) policy that restricts the flow of information based on label relationships. In contrast to
Discretionary Access Control (DAC) based on ownership, the MLS policy enforced by Trusted Extensions is an ex<hy>
ample of Mandatory Access Control (MAC).
By default, Trusted Extensions software is disabled. It is enabled and disabled (but not configured) by the la<hy>
beld(1M) service, identified by the FMRI:
 svc:/system/labeld:default
Refer to the Administrator's Guide listed below for the required configuration of Trusted Extensions software neces<hy>
sary before use. The system must be rebooted after enabling or disabling labeld to activate or deactivate Trusted Ex<hy>
tensions software.
