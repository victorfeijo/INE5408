fmlcut <-> cut out selected fields of each line of a file
fmlcut -clist [filename]...
fmlcut -flist [-dchar] [-s] [filename]...
The fmlcut function cuts out columns from a table or fields from each line in filename; in database parlance, it im<hy>
plements the projection of a relation. fmlcut can be used as a filter; if filename is not specified or is <mi>, the standard
input is read. list specifies the fields to be selected. Fields can be fixed length (character positions) or variable length
(separated by a field delimiter character), depending on whether -c or -f is specified.
Note: Either the -c or the -f option must be specified.
list A comma-separated list of integer field numbers (in increasing order), with optional <mi> to indicate ranges. For ex<hy>
ample: 1,4,7; 1<mi>3,8; <mi>5,10 (short for 1<mi>5,10); or 3<mi> (short for third through last field).
-clist If -c is specified, list specifies character positions (for instance, <mi>c1<mi>72 would pass the first 72 characters of
each line). Note: No space intervenes between -c and list.
-flist If -f is specified, list is a list of fields assumed to be separated in the file by the default delimiter character,
TAB, or by char if the -d option is specified. For example, <mi>f1,7 copies the first and seventh field only. Lines with no
delimiter characters are passed through intact (useful for table subheadings), unless -s is specified. Note: No space
intervenes between -f and list. The following options can be used if you have specified -f.
-dchar If -d is specified, char is the field delimiter. Space or other characters with special meaning to FMLI must be
quoted. Note: No space intervenes between -d and char . The default field delimiter is TAB.
-s Suppresses lines with no delimiter characters. If -s is not specified, lines with no delimiters will be passed through
untouched.

The following error messages may be displayed on the FMLI message line:
ERROR: line too long
A line has more than 1023 characters or fields, or there is no new-line character.
ERROR: bad list for c/f option
Missing -c or -f option or incorrectly specified list. No error occurs if a line has fewer fields than the list calls for.
ERROR: no fields
The list is empty.
ERROR: no delimiter
Missing char on -d option.
fmlcut cannot correctly process lines longer than 1023 characters, or lines with no newline character.
