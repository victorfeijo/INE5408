Named kstats are an array of name-value pairs. These pairs are kept in the kstat_named structure. When a kstat is
created by kstat_create(9F), the driver specifies how many of these structures will be allocated. The structures are
returned as an array pointed to by the ks_data field.
 union {
  char c[16];
  long l;
  ulong_t ul;
  longlong_t ll;
  u_longlong_t ull;
 } value; /* value of counter */
The only member exposed to drivers is the value member. This field is a union of several data types. The driver must
specify which type it will use in the call to kstat_named_init().
kstat_create(9F), kstat_named_init(9F)
