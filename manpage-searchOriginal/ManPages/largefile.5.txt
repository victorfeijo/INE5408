largefile <-> large file status of utilities
A large file is a regular file whose size is greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes). A small file is a regular file
whose size is less than 2 Gbyte.
A utility is called large file aware if it can process large files in the same manner as it does small files. A utility that
is large file aware is able to handle large files as input and generate as output large files that are being processed. The
exception is where additional files are used as system configuration files or support files that can augment the pro<hy>
cessing. For example, the file utility supports the -m option for an alternative "magic" file and the -f option for a sup<hy>
port file that can contain a list of file names. It is unspecified whether a utility that is large file aware will accept con<hy>
figuration or support files that are large files. If a large file aware utility does not accept configuration or support files
that are large files, it will cause no data loss or corruption upon encountering such files and will return an appropriate
error.

The /usr/bin/cpio and /usr/bin/pax utilities are large file aware, but cannot archive a file whose size exceeds 8
Gbyte - 1 byte.
The /usr/bin/truss utilities has been modified to read a dump file and display information relevant to large files, such
as offsets.

A utility is called large file safe if it causes no data loss or corruption when it encounters a large file. A utility that is
large file safe is unable to process properly a large file, but returns an appropriate error.
The following /usr/bin utilities are large file safe:
tab(); lw(1.36i) lw(1.04i) lw(1.21i) lw(1.11i) lw(.78i) lw(1.36i) lw(1.04i) lw(1.21i) lw(1.11i) lw(.78i) audioconver<hy>
