putws <-> convert a string of Process Code characters to EUC characters
#include <stdio.h>
#include <widec.h>
int putws(wchar_t *s);
The putws() function converts the Process Code string (terminated by a (wchar_t)NULL) pointed to by s, to an Ex<hy>
tended Unix Code (EUC) string followed by a NEWLINE character, and writes it to the standard output stream std<hy>
out. It does not write the terminal null character.
The putws() function returns the number of Process Code characters transformed and written. It returns EOF if it
attempts to write to a file that has not been opened for writing.
