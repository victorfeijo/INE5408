lpmove <-> move print requests
lpmove [request-ID] destination
lpmove source destination
The lpmove command moves print requests queued by lp(1) or lpr(1B) between destinations.
The first form of lpmove moves specific print requests (request-ID) to a specific destination.
The second form of the lpmove command moves all print requests from one destination (destination1) to another
(destination2). This form of lpmove also rejects new print requests for destination1.
lpmove moves individual requests or entire queues only within an instance of a print service, not between a local
and a remote queues or local queues on different instances of a print service. Requests can only be moved if the print
service or protocol supports it. The LP print server and IPP print protocol both support moving requests between
queues. The BSD print protocol does not.
When moving requests, lpmove does not check the acceptance status of the destination to which the print requests
are being moved (see accept(1M)). lpmove does not move requests that have options (for example, content type or
requiring a special form) that cannot be handled by the new destination.
The following operands are supported:
request-ID The specific print request to be moved. Specify request-ID as the identifier associated with a print request
as reported by lpstat. See lpstat(1).
destination The name of the printer or class of printers (see lpadmin(1M)) to which lpmove moves a specified print
request. Specify destination using atomic, URI-style (scheme://endpoint), POSIX-style (server:destination) syntax.
source The name of the destination from which lpmove moves all print requests. Specify destination using atomic,
URI-style (scheme://endpoint), POSIX-style (server:destination) syntax.
See printers.conf(4) for information regarding the naming conventions for atomic names and standards(5) for in<hy>
formation regarding POSIX.
