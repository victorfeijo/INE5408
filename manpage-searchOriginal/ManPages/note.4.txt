note <-> specify legal annotations
/usr/lib/note
Each file in this directory contains the NOTE (also _NOTE) annotations legal for a single tool. The name of the
file, by convention, should be the tool vendor's stock name, followed by a hyphen, followed by the tool name. For
example, for Sun's lock_lint tool the filename should be SUNW-lock_lint.
The file should contain the names of the annotations understood by the tool, one per line. For example, if a tool un<hy>
derstands the following annotations:
 NOTE(NOT_REACHED)
 NOTE(MUTEX_PROTECTS_DATA(list_lock, list_head))
then its file in /usr/lib/note should contain the entries:
 NOT_REACHED
 MUTEX_PROTECTS_DATA
Blank lines, and lines beginning with a pound (#), are ignored.
While /usr/lib/note is the default directory tools search for such files, they can be made to search other directories
instead simply by setting environment variable NOTEPATH to contain the paths, separated by colons, of directories
to be searched, e.g., /usr/mytool/note:/usr/lib/note.
These files are used by such tools whenever they encounter NOTEs they do not understand. If a file in /usr/lib/note
contains the annotation, then it is valid. If no such file contains the annotation, then the tool should issue a warning
complaining that it might be invalid.
NOTEPATH specify paths to be searched for annotation files. Paths are separated by colons (":").
