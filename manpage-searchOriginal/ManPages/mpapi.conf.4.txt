mpapi.conf <-> configuration file for libMPAPI
/etc/mpapi.conf
The /etc/mpapi.conf file is used to specify the vendor-provided plugin library that is installed on the system. This
file is used by the libMPAPI(3LIB) common library to load the individual plugin library when its interface is called.
If changes are made to the file while the library is in use, the library should be unloaded and reloaded. Addition and
removal of the plugin library should be handled through MP_RegisterPlugin(3MPAPI) and MP_DeregisterPlug<hy>
in(3MPAPI).
Each plugin library entry is a single line of the form:
 "id" "library file name"
where
id The identification of library. It is the resersed domain name of the vendor followed by . followed by the vendor
specific name of the plugin that uniquiely identifies the plugin library.
library file name The shared object library file in the absolute path format.
