spline <-> interpolate smooth curve
spline [-aknpx] ...
spline takes pairs of numbers from the standard input as abcissas and ordinates of a function. It produces a similar
set, which is approximately equally spaced and includes the input set, on the standard output. The cubic spline out<hy>
put (R. W. Hamming, Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers,2nd ed., 349ff) has two continuous deriv<hy>
atives, and sufficiently many points to look smooth when plotted, for example by graph(1).
-a Supply abscissas automatically (they are missing from the input); spacing is given by the next argument, or is as<hy>
sumed to be 1 if next argument is not a number.
-k The constant k used in the boundary value computation
(2nd deriv. at end) = k*(2nd deriv. next to end)
is set by the next argument. By default k = 0.
-n Space output points so that approximately n intervals occur between the lower and upper x limits. (Default n =
100.)
-p Make output periodic, that is, match derivatives at ends. First and last input values should normally agree.
-x Next 1 (or 2) arguments are lower (and upper) x limits. Normally these limits are calculated from the data. Auto<hy>
matic abcissas start at lower limit (default 0).

When data is not strictly monotonic in x, spline reproduces the input without interpolating extra points.
A limit of 1000 input points is enforced silently.
