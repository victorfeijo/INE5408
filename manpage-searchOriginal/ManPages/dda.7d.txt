dda <-> MMS disk archiving driver
/devices/pseudo/dda@lun:bn
The Media Management System (MMS) is a distributed removable media management system based on the IEEE
1244 Media Management System specification. MMS provides a uniform and consistent tape interface to client ap<hy>
plications.
The dda driver is a pseudo tape drive with filesystem file media. The dda driver is a minimal emulation of the
st(7D) tape driver mtio(7I) interface with BSD no-rewind behavior and is used for MMS disk archiving. The dda
driver should be used with a MMS MMP mount command handle. You configure DDA tapes, drives, and libraries
for disk archiving using the mmsadm(1M) command. You also use mmsadm(1M) to mount and unmount dda me<hy>
dia.
To set the number of disk archiving tape drives available for MMS disk archiving, edit the /kernel/drv/dda.conf
configuration file. The default number of disk archiving tape drives is 20.
The disk archiving tape drive devlinks are located in the /dev/dda directory.
The DDA maximum block size is 262144 bytes and the minimum is 1 byte.
