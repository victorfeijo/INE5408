telldir <-> current location of a named directory stream
#include <dirent.h>
long int telldir(DIR *dirp);
The telldir() function obtains the current location associated with the directory stream specified by dirp.
If the most recent operation on the directory stream was a seekdir(3C), the directory position returned from the
telldir() is the same as that supplied as a loc argument for seekdir().
Upon successful completion, telldir() returns the current location of the specified directory stream.
The telldir() function will fail if:
EOVERFLOW The current location of the directory cannot be stored in an object of type long.
