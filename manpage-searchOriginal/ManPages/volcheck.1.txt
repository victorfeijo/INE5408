volcheck <-> checks for media in a drive and by default checks all floppy media
volcheck [-v] [-i secs] [-t secs] pathname
The volcheck utility tells volume management to look at each dev/pathname in sequence and determine if new me<hy>
dia has been inserted in the drive.
The default action is to volcheck all checkable media managed by volume management.
The following options are supported:
-i secs Set the frequency of device checking to secs seconds. The default is 2 seconds. The minimum frequency is 1
second.
-t secs Check the named device(s) for the next secs seconds. The maximum number of seconds allowed is 28800,
which is 8 hours. The frequency of checking is specified by -i. There is no default total time.
-v Verbose.
The following operands are supported:
pathname The path name of a media device.
Example 1 A sample of the volcheck command.
The following example
  example% volcheck <mi>v /dev/diskette
  /dev/diskette has media
asks volume management to examine the floppy drive for new media.
The following example
  example% volcheck <mi>i 2 <mi>t 600 /dev/diskette1 &
asks volume management if there is a floppy in the floppy drive every 2 seconds for 600 seconds (10 minutes).
/dev/volctl volume management control port

Due to a hardware limitation in many floppy drives, the act of checking for media causes mechanical action in the
floppy drive. Continuous polling of the floppy drive will cause the drive to wear out. It is recommended that
polling the drive only be performed during periods of high use.
