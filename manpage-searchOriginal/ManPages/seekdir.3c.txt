void seekdir(DIR *dirp, long int loc);
The seekdir() function sets the position of the next readdir(3C) operation on the directory stream specified by dirp
to the position specified by loc. The value of loc should have been returned from an earlier call to telldir(3C). The
new position reverts to the one associated with the directory stream when telldir() was performed.
If the value of loc was not obtained from an earlier call to telldir() or if a call to rewinddir(3C) occurred between
the call to telldir () and the call to seekdir(), the results of subsequent calls to readdir() are unspecified.
The seekdir() function returns no value.
No errors are defined.
