sar <-> system activity reporter
sar [-aAbcdgkmpqruvwy] [-o filename] t [n]
sar [-aAbcdgkmpqruvwy] [-e time] [-f filename] [-i sec]
 [-s time]
In the first instance, the sar utility samples cumulative activity counters in the operating system at n intervals of t
seconds, where t should be 5 or greater. If t is specified with more than one option, all headers are printed together
and the output can be difficult to read. (If the sampling interval is less than 5, the activity of sar itself can affect the
sample.) If the -o option is specified, it saves the samples in filename in binary format. The default value of n is 1.
In the second instance, no sampling interval is specified. sar extracts data from a previously recorded filename, ei<hy>
ther the one specified by the -f option or, by default, the standard system activity daily data file /var/adm/sa/sadd for
the current day dd. The starting and ending times of the report can be bounded using the -e and -s arguments with
time specified in the form hh[:mm[:ss]]. The -i option selects records at sec second intervals. Otherwise, all intervals
found in the data file are reported.
The following options modify the subsets of information reported by sar.
-a Reports use of file access system routines: iget/s, namei/s, dirblk/s
-A Reports all data. Equivalent to -abcdgkmpqruvwy.
-b Reports buffer activity:
bread/s, bwrit/s transfers per second of data between system buffers and disk or other block devices.
lread/s, lwrit/s accesses of system buffers.
%rcache, %wcache cache hit ratios, that is, (1<mi>bread/lread) as a percentage.
pread/s, pwrit/s transfers using raw (physical) device mechanism.
If run in a non-global zone and the pools facility is active, these values reflect activity on the processors of the pro<hy>
cessor set of the pool to which the zone is bound.
-c Reports system calls:
scall/s
system calls of all types.
sread/s, swrit/s, fork/s, exec/s
specific system calls.
rchar/s, wchar/s
characters transferred by read and write system calls. No incoming or outgoing exec(2) and fork(2) calls are report<hy>
ed.
If run in a non-global zone and the pools facility is active, these values reflect activity on the processors of the pro<hy>
cessor set of the pool to which the zone is bound.
-d Reports activity for each block device (for example, disk or tape drive) with the exception of XDC disks and tape
drives. When data is displayed, the device specification dsk- is generally used to represent a disk drive. The device
specification used to represent a tape drive is machine dependent. The activity data reported is:
<beginning of page>
%busy, avque portion of time device was busy servicing a transfer request, average number of requests outstanding
during that time.
read/s, write/s, blks/s number of read/write transfers from or to device, number of bytes transferred in 512-byte
units.
avwait average wait time in milliseconds.
avserv average service time in milliseconds.
For more general system statistics, use iostat(1M), sar(1M), or vmstat(1M).
See System Administration Guide: Advanced Administration for naming conventions for disks.
-e time Selects data up to time. Default is 18:00.
-f filename Uses filename as the data source for sar. Default is the current daily data file /var/adm/sa/sadd.
-g Reports paging activities:
pgout/s page-out requests per second.
ppgout/s pages paged-out per second.
pgfree/s pages per second placed on the free list by the page stealing daemon.
pgscan/s pages per second scanned by the page stealing daemon.
%ufs_ipf the percentage of UFS inodes taken off the freelist by iget which had reusable pages associated with them.
These pages are flushed and cannot be reclaimed by processes. Thus, this is the percentage of igets with page flush<hy>
es.
If run in a non-global zone and the pools facility is active, these values reflect activity on the processors of the pro<hy>
cessor set of the pool to which the zone is bound.
-i sec Selects data at intervals as close as possible to sec seconds.
-k Reports kernel memory allocation (KMA) activities:
sml_mem, alloc, fail information about the memory pool reserving and allocating space for small requests: the
amount of memory in bytes KMA has for the small pool, the number of bytes allocated to satisfy requests for small
amounts of memory, and the number of requests for small amounts of memory that were not satisfied (failed).
lg_mem, alloc, fail information for the large memory pool (analogous to the information for the small memory
pool).
ovsz_alloc, fail the amount of memory allocated for oversize requests and the number of oversize requests which
could not be satisfied (because oversized memory is allocated dynamically, there is not a pool).
<beginning of page>
-m Reports message and semaphore activities:
msg/s, sema/s primitives per second.
If run in a non-global zone and the pools facility is active, these values reflect activity on the processors of the pro<hy>
cessor set of the pool to which the zone is bound.
-o filename Saves samples in file, filename, in binary format.
-p Reports paging activities:
atch/s page faults per second that are satisfied by reclaiming a page currently in memory (attaches per second).
pgin/s page-in requests per second.
ppgin/s pages paged-in per second.
pflt/s page faults from protection errors per second (illegal access to page) or "copy-on-writes".
vflt/s address translation page faults per second (valid page not in memory).
slock/s faults per second caused by software lock requests requiring physical I/O.
If run in a non-global zone and the pools facility is active, these values reflect activity on the processors of the pro<hy>
cessor set of the pool to which the zone is bound.
-q Reports average queue length while occupied, and percent of time occupied:
runq-sz, %runocc Run queue of kernel threads in memory and runnable
swpq-sz, %swpocc Swap queue of processes
-r Reports unused memory pages and disk blocks:
freemem average pages available to user processes.
freeswap disk blocks available for page swapping.
-s time Selects data later than time in the form hh[:mm]. Default is 08:00.
-u Reports CPU utilization (the default):
%usr, %sys, %wio, %idle portion of time running in user mode, running in system mode, idle with some process
waiting for block I/O, and otherwise idle.
If run in a non-global zone and the pools facility is active, these values reflect activity on the processors of the pro<hy>
cessor set of the pool to which the zone is bound.
-v Reports status of process, i-node, file tables:
<beginning of page>
proc-sz, inod-sz, file-sz, lock-sz
entries/size for each table, evaluated once at sampling point.
ov
overflows that occur between sampling points for each table.
-w Reports system swapping and switching activity:
swpin/s, swpot/s, bswin/s, bswot/s
number of transfers and number of 512-byte units transferred for swapins and swapouts (including initial loading of
some programs).
pswch/s
process switches.
If run in a non-global zone and the pools facility is active, these values reflect activity on the processors of the pro<hy>
cessor set of the pool to which the zone is bound.
-y Reports TTY device activity:
rawch/s, canch/s, outch/s input character rate, input character rate processed by canon, output character rate.
rcvin/s, xmtin/s, mdmin/s receive, transmit and modem interrupt rates.
If run in a non-global zone and the pools facility is active, these values reflect activity on the processors of the pro<hy>
cessor set of the pool to which the zone is bound.
