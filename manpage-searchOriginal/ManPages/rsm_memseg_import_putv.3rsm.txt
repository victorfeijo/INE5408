int rsm_memseg_import_putv(rsm_scat_gath_t *sg_io);
int rsm_memseg_import_getv(rsm_scat_gath_t *sg_io);
The rsm_memseg_import_putv() and rsm_memseg_import_getv() functions provide for using a list of I/O re<hy>
quests rather than a single source and destination address as is done for thersm_memseg_import_put(3RSM) and
rsm_memseg_import_get(3RSM) functions.
The I/O vector component of the scatter-gather list (sg_io), allows specifying local virtual addresses or local_memo<hy>
ry_handles. When a local address range is used repeatedly, it is efficient to use a handle because allocated system re<hy>
sources (that is, locked down local memory) are maintained until the handle is freed. The supporting functions for
handles are rsm_create_localmemory_handle(3RSM) and rsm_free_localmemory_handle(3RSM).
Virtual addresses or handles may be gathered into the vector for writing to a single remote segment, or a read from a
single remote segment may be scattered to the vector of virtual addresses or handles.
Implicit mapping is supported for the scatter-gather type of access. The attributes of the extension library for the
specific interconnect are used to determine whether mapping is necessary before any scatter-gather access. If map<hy>
ping of the imported segment is a prerequisite for scatter-gather access and the mapping has not already been per<hy>
formed, an implicit mapping is performed for the imported segment. The I/O for the vector is then initiated.
I/O for the entire vector is initiated before returning. The barrier mode attribute of the import segment determines if
the I/O has completed before the function returns. A barrier mode attribute setting of IMPLICIT guarantees that
the transfer of data is completed in the order as entered in the I/O vector. An implicit barrier open and close sur<hy>
rounds each list entry. If an error is detected, I/O for the vector is terminated and the function returns immediately.
The residual count indicates the number of entries for which the I/O either did not complete or was not initiated.
The number of entries in the I/O vector component of the scatter-gather list is specified in the io_request_count
field of the rsm_scat_gath_t pointed to by sg_io. The io_request_count is valid if greater than 0 and less than or
equal to RSM_MAX_SGIOREQS. If io_request_count is not in the valid range, rsm_memseg_import_putv()
and rsm_memseg_import_getv() returns RSMERR_BAD_SGIO.
Optionally, the scatter-gather list allows support for an implicit signal post after the I/O for the entire vector has
completed. This alleviates the need to do an explicit signal post after ever I/O transfer operation. The means of en<hy>
abling the implicit signal post involves setting the flags field within the scatter-gather list to RSM_IMPLIC<hy>
IT_SIGPOST. The flags field may also be set to RSM_SIG_POST_NO_ACCUMULATE, which will be passed
on to the signal post operation when RSM_IMPLICIT_SIGPOST is set.
Upon successful completion, these functions return 0. Otherwise, an error value is returned to indicate the error.
The rsm_memseg_import_putv() and rsm_memseg_import_getv() functions can return the following errors:
RSMERR_BAD_SGIO
Invalid scatter-gather structure pointer.
RSMERR_BAD_SEG_HNDL
Invalid segment handle.
RSMERR_BAD_CTLR_HNDL
Invalid controller handle.
RSMERR_BAD_OFFSET
Invalid offset.

RSMERR_BAD_LENGTH

RSMERR_BAD_ADDR
Bad address.
RSMERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES
Insufficient resources.
RSMERR_INTERRUPTED
The operation was interrupted by a signal.
RSMERR_PERM_DENIED
Permission denied.
RSMERR_BARRIER_FAILURE
I/O completion error.
RSMERR_REMOTE_NODE_UNREACHABLE
