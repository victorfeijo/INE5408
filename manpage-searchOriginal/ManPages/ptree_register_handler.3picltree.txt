int ptree_register_handler(const char *ename,
 void (*evt_handler)(const char *ename, const void *earg,
 size_t size, void *cookie), void *cookie);
The ptree_register_handler() function registers an event handler for a PICL event. The argument ename specifies
the name of the PICL event for which to register the handler. The argument evt_handler specifies the event handler
function. The argument cookie is a pointer to caller-specific data to be passed as an argument to the event handler
when it is invoked.
The event handler function must be defined as
 void evt_handler(const char *ename, const void *earg, \
  size_t size, void *cookie)
where, ename, earg, size, and cookie are the arguments passed to the event handler when it is invoked. The argument
ename is the PICL event name for which the handler is invoked. The arguments earg and size gives the pointer to the
event argument buffer and its size, respectively. The argument cookie is the pointer to the caller specific data regis<hy>
tered with the handler. The arguments ename and earg point to buffers that are transient and shall not be modified by
the event handler or reused after the event handler finishes execution.
The PICL framework invokes the event handlers in the order in which they were registered when dispatching an
event. If the event handler execution order is required to be the same as the plug-in dependency order, then a plug-in
should register its handlers from its init function. The handlers that do not have any ordering dependencies on other
plug-in handlers can be registered at any time.
The registered handler may be called at any time after this function is called.
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. On failure, a non-negative integer is returned to indicate an error and the
handler is not registered.
PICL_INVALIDARG Invalid argument
PICL_FAILURE General system failure
