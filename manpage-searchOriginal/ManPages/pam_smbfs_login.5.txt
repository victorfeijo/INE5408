pam_smbfs_login <-> PAM user credential authentication module for SMB/CIFS client login
pam_smb_cred.so.1
The pam_smbfs_login module implements pam_sm_setcred(3PAM) to provide functions that act equivalently to
the smbutil(1) login command.
This optional functionality is meant to be used only in environments that do not run Active Directory or Kerberos,
but which synchronize passwords between Solaris clients and their CIFS/SMB servers.
This module permits the login password to be stored as if the smbutil(1) login command was used to store a pass<hy>
word for PAM_USER in the user or system default domain. The choice of default domain is the first of the follow<hy>
ing:
 -Domain entry specified in the default section of the $HOME/.nsmbrc file, if readable.
 -Domain entry specified in the default section shown by the sharectl get smbfs command.
 -String WORKGROUP.
Because pam_smbfs_login runs as root during the login process, a $HOME/.nsmbrc file accessed through NFS
may only be readable if the file permits reads by others. This conflicts with the requirement that passwords stored in
$HOME/.nsmbrc are ignored when permissions are open.
To use this functionality, add the following line to the /etc/pam.conf file:
 login auth optional pam_smbfs_login.so.1
Authentication service modules must implement both pam_sm_authenticate(3PAM) and pam_sm_set<hy>
cred(3PAM). In this module, pam_sm_authenticate(3PAM) always returns PAM_IGNORE.
The pam_sm_setcred(3PAM) function accepts the following flags:
PAM_REFRESH_CRED
Returns PAM_IGNORE.
PAM_SILENT
Suppresses messages.
PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED
PAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED
Stores the authentication token for PAM_USER in the same manner as the smbutil(1) login command.
PAM_DELETE_CRED
Deletes the stored password for PAM_USER in the same manner as the smbutil(1) logout command.
The following options can be passed to the pam_smbfs_login module:
debug
Produces syslog(3C) debugging information at the LOG_AUTH or LOG_DEBUG level.
nowarn
Suppresses warning messages.
$HOME/.nsmbrc Find default domain, if present.
Upon successful completion of pam_sm_setcred(3PAM), PAM_SUCCESS is returned. The following error
codes are returned upon error:
<beginning of page>
PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
User is unknown.
PAM_AUTHTOK_ERR
Password is bad.
PAM_AUTH_ERR
Domain is bad.
PAM_SYSTEM_ERR
System error.
