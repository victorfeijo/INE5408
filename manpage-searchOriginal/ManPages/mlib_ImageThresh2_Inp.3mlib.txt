mlib_status mlib_ImageThresh2_Inp(mlib_image *srcdst,
 const mlib_s32 *thresh, const mlib_s32 *glow);
The mlib_ImageThresh2_Inp() function compares each pixel in the source image to a threshold value, in place. If
the pixel is less than or equal to the threshold value, then the destination pixel is set to the low output level. If the
pixel is greater than the threshold value, then the destination pixel is set to the value of the source pixel.
It uses the following equation:
 srcdst[x][y][i] = glow[i] if srcdst[x][y][i] <<=> thresh[i]
The function takes the following arguments:
srcdst Pointer to source and destination image.
thresh Threshold value. thresh[i] contains the threshold for channel i.
glow Low output level. glow[i] contains the low output level for channel i.
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
