lx_systrace <-> DTrace Linux system call tracing provider
The lx_systrace driver implements the DTrace lxsyscall dynamic tracing provider. The lxsyscall provider performs
dynamic instrumentation to offer probes that fire whenever a thread enters or returns from a Linux system call entry
point.
The lx_systrace driver is not a public interface and you access the instrumentation offered by this provider through
DTrace. Refer to the Solaris Dynamic Tracing Guide for a description of the public documented interfaces available
for the DTrace facility and the probes offered by the lxsyscall provider.
