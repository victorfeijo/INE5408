pcwl <-> Lucent/PrismII 802.11b wireless NIC driver
The pcwl 802.11b wireless NIC driver is a multi- threaded, loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based STREAMS driver. It
supports the pccard and PCI/MiniPCI cards with the Lucent and PrismII 802.11b chipsets on x86 and SPARC.
The pcwl driver supports 802.11b data rates of 1, 2, 5.5 and 11 (Mbits/sec). The default is 11.
The pcwl driver supports BSS networks (also known as "ap" or "infrastructure" networks) and IBSS (or "ad-hoc")
networks. For authentication type, the pcwl driver supports the "open" (or "open-system") mode and the "shared-
key" mode. For encryption type, only WEP is currently supported. You perform configuration and administration
tasks using the dladm(1M) and wificonfig(1M) utilities.
