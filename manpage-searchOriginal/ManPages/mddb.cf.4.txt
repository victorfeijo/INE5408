mddb.cf <-> metadevice state database replica locations
/etc/lvm/mddb.cf
The /etc/lvm/mddb.cf file is created when the metadb(1M) command is invoked. You should never directly edit this
file.
The file /etc/lvm/mddb.cf is used by the metainit(1M) command to find the locations of the metadevice state data<hy>
bases replicas. The metadb command creates the file and updates it each time it is run. Similar information is en<hy>
tered in the /kernel/drv/md.conf file.
Each metadevice state database replica has a unique entry in the /etc/lvm/mddb.cf file. Each entry contains the driv<hy>
er and minor unit numbers associated with the block physical device where a replica is stored. Each entry also con<hy>
tains the block number of the master block, which contains a list of all other blocks in the replica.
Entries in the /etc/lvm/mddb.cf file are of the form: driver_name minor_t daddr_t  checksum where driver_name
and minor_t represent the device number of the physical device storing this replica. daddr_t is the disk block ad<hy>
dress. checksum is used to make certain the entry has not been corrupted. A pound sign (#) introduces a comment.
Example 1 Sample File
The following example shows a mddb.cf file.
 #metadevice database location file do not hand edit
 #driver minor_t daddr_t device id checksum
 sd 152 16 id1,sd@SSEAGATE_JDD288110MC9LH/a -2613
In the example above, the value for daddr_t indicates that the offset from the start of a given partition is 16 disk
blocks from the start of that partition.
