ncab2clf <-> convert binary log file to Common Log File format
/usr/bin/ncab2clf [-Dhv] [-i input-file] [-o output-file]
 [-b size] [-n number] [-s datetime]
The ncab2clf command is used to convert the log file generated by the Solaris Network Cache and Accelerator
("NCA") from binary format, to Common Log File ("CLF") format. If no input-file is specified, ncab2clf uses
stdin. If no output-file is specified, the output goes to stdout.
-b Specifies the binary-log-file blocking in kilobytes; the default is 64 Kbyte.
-D Specifies that direct I/O be disabled.
-h Prints usage message.
-i input-file Specifies the input file.
-n number Output number CLF records.
-o output-file Specifies the output file.
-s datetime Skip any records before the date and time specified in datetime. You can specify the date and time in
CLF format or in the format specified by the touch(1) utility. CLF format is the dominant format, so ncab2clf first
analyzes datetime assuming CLF.
-v Provides verbose output.
Example 1 Converting a Binary File to a Common Log File Format
The following example converts the binary file /var/nca/logs/nca.blf to a file /var/nca/logs/nca.clf, which is in
Common Log File format.
 example% ncab2clf -D -i /var/nca/logs/nca.blf -o /var/nca/logs/nca.clf
Example 2 Converting Multiple Log Files
The following script may be used to convert multiple log files. The directory designated by "*" must only contain
log files.
 !/bin/ksh
 for filename in *
 do
  ncab2clf -D < $filename > $filename.clf
 done
Example 3 Using -s and -n on a Raw Device
The following example shows how ncab2clf can be used on a raw device. If not using the -n option, the default is to
convert all records from the starting location to the end of the file. The date and time specified with -s, below, is in
CLF format.
 example% ncab2clf -s '10/Apr/2001:09:23:13' -n 100 < /dev/dsk/c2t1d0s6

The following exit values are returned:
0 The file converted successfully
>0 An error occurred.

The binary log files generated by NCA can become very large. When converting these large binary files, use the -b
option to the ncab2clf command to help performance.
Direct I/O is a benefit to the user if the data being written does not come in as large chunks. However, if the user
wishes to convert the log file in large chunks using the -b option, then direct I/O should be disabled by using the -D
option.
