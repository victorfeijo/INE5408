 zonename filename
The named-checkzone utility checks the syntax and integrity of a zone file. It performs the same checks as
named(1M) does when loading a zone. The named-checkzone utility is useful for checking zone files before con<hy>
figuring them into a name server.
The following options are supported:
-c class Specify the class of the zone. If not specified, "IN" is assumed.
-d Enable debugging.
-D Dump zone file in canonical format.
-k mode Perform "check-name" checks with the specified failure mode. Possible modes are "fail", "warn" (the de<hy>
fault) and "ignore".
-j Read the journal, if it exists, when loading the zone file.
-n mode Specify whether NS records should be checked to see if they are addresses. Possible modes are "fail",
"warn" (the default) and "ignore".
-o filename Write zone output to filename.
-q Run in quiet mode, reporting only the exit status.
-t directory chroot to directory so that include directives in the configuration file are processed as if run by a similar<hy>
ly chrooted named.
-v Print the version of the named-checkzone program and exit.
-w directory chdir to directory so that relative filenames in master file $INCLUDE directives work. This is similar
to the directory clause in named.conf.
The following operands are supported:
filename The name of the zone file.
zonename The domain name of the zone being checked.
