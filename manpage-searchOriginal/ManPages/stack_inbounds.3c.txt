#include <ucontext.h>
int stack_inbounds(void *addr);
The stack_inbounds() function returns a boolean value indicating whether the address specified by addr is within
the boundaries of the stack of the calling thread. The address is compared to the stack boundary information returned
by a call to stack_getbounds(3C).
The stack_inbounds() function returns 0 to indicate that addr is not within the current stack bounds, or a non-zero
value to indicate that addr is within the stack bounds.
No errors are defined.
