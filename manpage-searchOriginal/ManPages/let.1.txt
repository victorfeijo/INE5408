let <-> shell built-in function to evaluate one or more arithmetic expressions
let arg...
let [expr...]
Each arg is a separate arithmetic expression to be evaluated.
let evaluates each expr in the current shell environment as an arithmetic expression using ANSI C syntax. Variables
names are shell variables and they are recursively evaluated as arithmetic expressions to get numerical values. let has
been made obsolete by the ((...)) syntax of ksh93(1) which does not require quoting of the operators to pass them as
command arguments.
ksh returns the following exit values:
0 The value of the last expression is non-zero.
1 The value of the last expression is zero.
ksh93 returns the following exit values:
0 The last expr evaluates to a non-zero value.
>0 The last expr evaluates to 0 or an error occurred.
