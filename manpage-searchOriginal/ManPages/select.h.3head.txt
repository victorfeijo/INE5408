The time_t and suseconds_t types are defined as described in <sys/types.h>. See types.h(3HEAD).
The sigset_t type is defined as described in signal.h(3HEAD).
The timespec structure is defined as described in <time.h>. See time.h(3HEAD).
The <sys/select.h> header defines the fd_set type as a structure.
The following is defined as a macro:
