OM_uint32 gss_display_status(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
 OM_uint32 status value,int status type,
 const gss_OID mech_type, OM_uint32 *message_context,
 gss_buffer_t status string);
The gss_display_status() function enables an application to obtain a textual representation of a GSS-API status
code for display to the user or for logging purposes. Because some status values may indicate multiple conditions,
applications may need to call gss_display_status() multiple times, with each call generating a single text string.
The message_context parameter is used by gss_acquire_cred() to store state information on error messages that are
extracted from a given status_value. The message_context parameter must be initialized to 0 by the application prior
to the first call, and gss_display_status() will return a non-zero value in this parameter if there are further messages
to extract.
The message_context parameter contains all state information required by gss_display_status() to extract further
messages from the status_value. If a non-zero value is returned in this parameter, the application is not required to
call gss_display_status() again unless subsequent messages are desired.
The parameter descriptions for gss_display_status() follow:
minor_status Status code returned by the underlying mechanism.
status_value Status value to be converted.
status_type If the value is GSS_C_GSS_CODE, status_value is a GSS-API status code. If the value is
GSS_C_MECH_CODE, then status_value is a mechanism status code.
mech_type Underlying mechanism that is used to interpret a minor status value. Supply GSS_C_NO_OID to obtain
the system default.
message_context Should be initialized to zero prior to the first call. On return from gss_display_status(), a non-zero
status_value parameter indicates that additional messages may be extracted from the status code by means of subse<hy>
quent calls to gss_display_status(), passing the same status_value, status_type, mech_type, and message_contextpa<hy>
rameters.
status_string Textual representation of the status_value. Storage associated with this parameter must be freed by the
application after use with a call to gss_release_buffer(3GSS).
The gss_display_status() function may return the following status codes:
GSS_S_COMPLETE Successful completion.
GSS_S_BAD_MECH Indicates that translation in accordance with an unsupported mechanism type was requested.
GSS_S_BAD_STATUS The status value was not recognized, or the status type was neither GSS_C_GSS_CODE
nor GSS_C_MECH_CODE.
GSS_S_FAILURE The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific GSS status code is defined.
The mechanism-specific status code reported by means of the minor_status parameter details the error condition.
