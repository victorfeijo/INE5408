getpw <-> get passwd entry from UID
#include <stdlib.h>
int getpw(uid_t uid, char *buf);
The getpw() function searches the user data base for a user id number that equals uid, copies the line of the pass<hy>
word file in which uid was found into the array pointed to by buf, and returns 0. getpw() returns non-zero if uid can<hy>
not be found.
This function is included only for compatibility with prior systems and should not be used; the functions described
on the getpwnam(3C) manual page should be used instead.
If the /etc/passwd and the /etc/group files have a plus sign (+) for the NIS entry, then getpwent() and getgrent()
will not return NULL when the end of file is reached. See getpwnam(3C).
The getpw() function returns non-zero on error.
