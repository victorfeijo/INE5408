#include <sys/utsname.h>
The <sys/utsname.h> header defines the structure utsname, which includes the following members:
 char sysname[] /* name of this implementation of the
  operating system */
 char nodename[] /* name of this node within an
  implementation-defined communications
  network */
 char release[] /* current release level of this
  implementation */
 char version[] /* current version level of this
  release */
 char machine[] /* name of the hardware type on which
  the system is running */
The character arrays are of unspecified size, but the data stored in them is terminated by a null byte.
