smbautohome <-> CIFS autohome configuration
smbautohome
The Solaris CIFS service can automatically share home directories when a CIFS client connects. The autohome map
file, /etc/smbautohome, uses the search options and rules to determine whether to share a home directory when a
CIFS client connects to the server.
For example, the following entries specify the autohome rules for a particular environment:
 +nsswitch  dn=ad,dn=sun,dn=com,ou=users
 jane /home/?/& dn=ad,dn=sun,dn=com,ou=users
The nsswitch autohome entry uses the naming service to match users to home directories. The second autohome en<hy>
try specifies that the home directory for user jane is /home/j/jane.
A map entry, which is also referred to as a mapping, uses the following format:
 key location [ options ]
key is a user name, location is the fully qualified path for the user's home directory, and options specifies the share
options, for example, an AD container or description. See sharemgr(1M) for information on share options.
If you intend to publish the share in Active Directory (AD), you must specify an AD container name, which is spec<hy>
ified as a comma-separated list of attribute name-value pairs. The attributes use the LDAP distinguished name (DN)
or relative distinguished name (RDN) format.
The DN or RDN must be specified in LDAP format by using the following attribute types: <bu> cn= represents the com<hy>
mon name <bu> ou= represents the organizational unit <bu> dc= represents the domain component
The attribute type that is used to describe an object's RDN is called a naming attribute. AD uses the naming at<hy>
tributes as follows: <bu> cn for the user object class <bu> ou for the OU (organizational unit) object class <bu> dc for the do<hy>
mainDns object class
The autohome feature supports the following wildcard substitutions for the value of the key field: <bu> The ampersand
character (&) is expanded to the value of the key field for the entry in which it occurs. In the following example, &
expands to jane:
 jane /home/&
<bu> The question mark character (?) is expanded to the value of the first character in the key field for the entry in which
it occurs. In the following example, ? expands to j:
 jane /home/?/&
When supplied in the key field, the asterisk character (*) is recognized as the "catch-all" entry. Such an entry match<hy>
es any key not previously matched.
For example, the following entry would map any user to a home directory in /home in which the home directory
name was the same as the user name:
 * /home/&
The wildcard rule is only applied if an appropriate rule is not matched by another map entry.
The nsswitch map is used to request that the home directory be obtained from a password database, such as the lo<hy>
cal, NIS, NIS+, or LDAP databases. If an AD path is appended, it is used to publish shares.

Like the "catch-all" entry, the nsswitch map is only searched if an appropriate rule is not matched by another map
entry.
The wildcard and nsswitch rules are mutually exclusive. Do not include an nsswitch rule if a wildcard rule has al<hy>
ready been defined.
