OM_uint32 gss_release_oid_set(OM_uint32 *minor_status, gss_OID_set *set);
The gss_release_oid_set() function frees storage associated with a GSS-API-generated gss_OID_set object. The set
parameter must refer to an OID-set that was returned from a GSS-API function. The gss_release_oid_set() function
will free the storage associated with each individual member OID, the OID set's elements array, and
gss_OID_set_desc.
gss_OID_set is set to GSS_C_NO_OID_SET on successful completion of this function.
The parameter descriptions for gss_release_oid_set() follow:
minor_status A mechanism-specific status code
set Storage associated with the gss_OID_set will be deleted
The gss_release_oid_set() function may return the following status codes:
GSS_S_COMPLETE Successful completion
GSS_S_FAILURE The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific GSS status code is defined.
The mechanism-specific status code reported by means of the minor_status parameter details the error condition.
