n2cp <-> Ultra-SPARC T2 crypto provider device driver
The n2cp device driver is a multi-threaded, loadable hardware driver supporting hardware-assisted acceleration of
the following cryptographic operations, which are built into the Ultra-SPARC T2 CMT processor:
 DES: CKM_DES_CBC, CKM_DES_ECB
 DES3: CKM_DES3_CBC, CKM_DES3_ECB,
 AES: CKM_AES_CBC, CKM_AES_ECB, CKM_AES_CTR, CKM_AES_CCM, CKM_AES_GCM,
  CKM_AES_GMAC
 RC4: CKM_RC4
 MD5: KM_MD5, CKM_MD5_HMAC, CKM_MD5_HMAC_GENERAL,
   CKM_SSL3_MD5_MAC
 SHA-1: CKM_SHA_1, CKM_SHA_1_HMAC,
  CKM_SHA_1_HMAC_GENERAL, CKM_SSL3_SHA1_MAC
 SHA-256:CKM_SHA256, CKM_SHA256_HMAC,
  CKM_SHA256_HMAC_GENERAL
You configure the n2cp driver by defining properties in the /platform/sun4v/kernel/drv/n2cp.conf which override
the default settings. The following property is supported:
nostats Disables the generation of statistics. The nostats property may be used to help prevent traffic analysis, how<hy>
ever, this may inhibit support personnel.
Solaris crypto drivers must implement statistics variables. The n2cp driver maintains the following statistics:
cwqXstate State (online, offline, error) of respective cryptographic engine, CWQ X.
cwqXsubmit Number of jobs submitted to CWQ X.
cwqXqfull Number of times when submitting a job that the queue for CWQ X was full.
cwqXqupdate_failure Number of submit job failures on CWQ X.
des Total number of jobs submitted to device for DES operations.
des3 Total number of jobs submitted to device for DES3 operations.
aes Total number of jobs submitted to device for AES operations.
md5 Total number of jobs submitted to device for MD5 operations.
sha1 Total number of jobs submitted to device for SHA-1 operations.
sha256 Total number of jobs submitted to device for SHA-256 operations.
md5hmac Total number of jobs submitted to device for HMAC_MD5 operations.
sha1hmac Total number of jobs submitted to device for HMAC_SHA-1 operations.
sha256hmac Total number of jobs submitted to device for HMAC_SHA-256 operations.
<beginning of page>
ssl3md5mac Total number of jobs submitted to device for SSL3_MAC_MD5 operations.
ssl3sha1mac Total number of jobs submitted to device for SSL3_MAC_SHA-1 operations.
ssl3sha256mac Total number of jobs submitted to device for SSL3_MAC_SHA-256 operations.
