The lp utility submits print requests to a destination. There are two formats of the lp command.
The first form of lp prints files (file) and associated information (collectively called a print request). If file is not
specified, lp assumes the standard input. Use a hyphen (<mi>) with file to specify the standard input. Files are printed in
the order in which they appear on the command line.
The second form of lp changes print request options. This form of lp can only be used with print services and proto<hy>
cols that support job modification. The LP print service allows print requests to be modified when they are in a
queue local to the system that the lp commands was executed on. The Internet Print Protocol (IPP) allows job modi<hy>
fication on remote ipp print services.
The print request identified by request-ID is changed according to the printing options specified. The printing op<hy>
tions available are the same as those with the first form of the lp. If the request has finished printing when the lp
command is executed, the change is rejected. If the request is in the process of printing, it is stopped and restarted
from the beginning (unless the -P option has been given).
The print client commands locate destination information using the "printers" database in the name service switch.
See nsswitch.conf(4), printers(4), and printers.conf(4) for details.
Printers that have a 4.x or BSD-based print server are not configured to handle BSD protocol extensions. lp han<hy>
dles print requests sent to such destinations differently (see NOTES).
The following options are supported:
-c Copies file before printing.
Unless -c is specified, users should not remove any file before the print request has completely printed. Changes
made to file after the print request is made but before it is printed might be reflected in the printed output. file is
linked (as opposed to copied).
-d destination Prints file on a specific destination. The -d option is used to set the destination only when the job is
first created. (Note: To move existing jobs to a different destination, see lpmove(1M).) destination can be either a
printer or a class of printers (see lpadmin(1M)). Specify destination using atomic, URI-style (scheme://endpoint), or
POSIX-style (server:destination) names. See printers.conf(4) for more information.
-f form-name Prints file on form-name. The LP print service ensures that the form is mounted on the printer. The
print request is rejected if the printer does not support form-name, if form-name is not defined for the system, or if
the user is not allowed to use form-name (see lpforms(1M)).
-H special-handling Prints the print request according to the value of special-handling. The following special-han<hy>
dling values are acceptable:
hold Do not print the print request until notified. If printing has already begun, stop it. Other print requests are
placed ahead of a request that has been put on hold (held print request) until the print request is resumed.
resume Resume a held print request. If the print request had begun to print when held, it is the next print request
printed, unless it is superseded by an immediate print request.
<beginning of page>
immediate Print the print request next. If more than one print request is assigned, the most recent print request is
printed next. If a print request is currently printing on the desired printer, a hold request must be issued to allow the
immediate request to print. The immediate request is only available to LP administrators.
-i request-ID Changes options for the print request identified by request-ID. There must be a space between -i and
request-ID.
This option applies to jobs that are in a local queue on a print server. This also applies to remote queues on when the
remote print server supports IPP with job modification.
-m Sends mail after file has printed (see mail(1)). By default, no mail is sent upon normal completion of a print re<hy>
quest.
-n number Prints a specific number of copies of file. Specify number as a digit. The default for number is 1.
-o option Specifies printer-dependent options. Specify several options by specifying -o option multiple times (-o op<hy>
tion -o option -o option ). Printer-dependent options can also be specified using the -o keyletter once, followed by a
list of options enclosed in double quotes (-o"option option option").
options take the following forms:
key=value Associates information with the request for use by the backend print service. The keys and values that can
be used are specific to the backend print service and queue configuration.
[no]key
 Associates boolean information with the request for use by the backend print service. The keys that can be used are
specific to the backend print service and queue configuration.
The following options are commonly used with the LP print service:
nobanner
Does not print a banner page with the request. This option can be disallowed by the LP administrator.
On a system that is configured with Trusted Extensions, use of this option requires the solaris.print.nobanner au<hy>
thorization.
nofilebreak
Prints multiple files without inserting a form feed between them.
nolabels
On a system that is configured with Trusted Extensions, specifies suppression of page header and footer labels. Use
of this option requires the solaris.print.unlabeled authorization.
length=numberi | numberc | number
Prints the print request with pages of a specific length in inches, centimeters, or number of lines. Append the letter i
for inches or c for centimenters to number. Indicate the number of lines by specifying number alone. length=66 in<hy>
dicates a page length of 66 lines. length=11i indicates a page length of 11 inches. length=27.94c indicates a page
length of 27.94 centimeters.
This option can not be used with the -f option.
<beginning of page>
width=numberi | numberc | number
Prints the print request with pages of a specific width in inches, centimeters, or number of columns. Append the let<hy>
ter i for inches or c for centimeters to number. Indicate the number of columns by specifying number alone.
width=65 indicates a page width of 65 columns. width=6.5i indicates a page width of 6.5 inches. width=10c indi<hy>
cates a page width of 10 centimeters.
This option can not be used with the -f option.
lpi=number
Prints the print request with the line pitch set to number lines in an inch. Use number to specify the number of lines
in an inch.
This option can not be used with the -f option.
cpi=n|pica|elite|compressed
Prints the print request with the character pitch set to number characters in an inch. Use number to specify the num<hy>
ber of characters in an inch. Use pica to set character pitch to pica (10 characters per inch), or elite to set character
pitch to elite (12 characters per inch) Use compressed to set character pitch to as many characters as the printer can
handle. There is no standard number of characters per inch for all printers; see the terminfo database (see termin<hy>
fo(4)) for the default character pitch for your printer. This option can not be used with the -f option.
stty=stty-option-list
Prints the request using a list of options valid for the stty command (see stty(1). Enclose the list in single quotes (`')
if it contains blanks.
-P page-list Prints the pages specified in page-list in ascending order. Specify page-list as a of range of numbers, sin<hy>
gle page number, or a combination of both.
The -P option can only be used if there is a filter available to handle it; otherwise, the print request is rejected.
-p Enables notification on completion of the print request. Delivery of the notification is dependent on additional
software.
-q priority-level Assigns the print request a priority in the print queue. Specify priority-level as an integer between
from 0 and 39. Use 0 to indicate the highest priority; 39 to indicate the lowest priority. If no priority is specified, the
default priority for a print service is assigned by the LP administrator. The LP administrator can also assign a de<hy>
fault priority to individual users.
-s Suppresses the display of messages sent from lp.
-S character-set |
-S print-wheel Prints the request using the character-set or print-wheel. If a form was requested and requires a char<hy>
acter set or print wheel other than the one specified with the -S option, the request is rejected. Printers using mount<hy>
able print wheels or font cartridges use the print wheel or font cartridge mounted at the time of the print request, un<hy>
less the -S option is specified.
Printers Using Print Wheels: If print wheel is not one listed by the LP administrator as acceptable for the printer the
request is rejected unless the print wheel is already mounted on the printer.
Printers Using Selectable or Programmable Character Sets: If the -S option is not specified, lp uses the standard
character set. If character-set is not defined in the terminfo database for the printer (see terminfo(4)), or is not an
alias defined by the LP administrator, the request is rejected.
<beginning of page>
-t title Prints a title on the banner page of the output. Enclose title in quotes if it contains blanks. If title is not not
specified, the name of the file is printed on the banner page.
-Tcontent-type [-r] Prints the request on a printer that can support the specified content-type. If no printer accepts
this type directly, a filter is used to convert the content into an acceptable type. If the -r option is specified, a filter is
not used. If -r is specified, and no printer accepts the content-type directly, the request is rejected. If the content-type
is not acceptable to any printer, either directly or with a filter, the request is rejected.
-w Writes a message on the user's terminal after the files have been printed. If the user is not logged in, then mail is
sent instead.
-y mode-list Prints the request according to the printing modes listed in mode-list. The allowed values for mode-list
are locally defined.
This option can be used only if there is a filter available to handle it; otherwise, the print request is rejected.
The following operand is supported:
file The name of the file to be printed. Specify file as a pathname or as a hyphen (<mi>) to indicate the standard input. If
file is not specified, lp uses the standard input.
See largefile(5) for the description of the behavior of lp when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte (
2^31 bytes).
See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of lp: LANG,
LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, NLSPATH, and PATH.
LC_TIME Determine the format and contents of date and time strings displayed in the lp banner page, if any.
LPDEST Determine the destination. If the LPDEST environment variable is not set, the PRINTER environment
variable shall be used. The -d dest option takes precedence over LPDEST. Results are undefined when -d is not
specified and LPDEST contains a value that is not a valid destination name.
PRINTER Determine the output device or destination. If the LPDEST and PRINTER environment variables are
not set, an unspecified output device is used. The -d dest option and the LPDEST environment variable shall take
precedence over PRINTER. Results are undefined when -d is not specified, LPDEST is unset, and PRINTER con<hy>
tains a value that is not a valid device or destination name.
TZ Determine the timezone used to calculate date and time strings displayed in the lp banner page, if any. If TZ is
unset or null, an unspecified default timezone shall be used.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
non-zero An error occurred.

CSI-capability assumes that printer names are composed of ASCII characters.
Print jobs are assumed to contain one type of data. That type of data is either specified on the command line or au<hy>
todetected (simple, PostScript) based on the contents of the first file in the job.
When using the BSD printing protocol to send print requests to a remote print service, functionality is limited.
Printers that have a 4.x or BSD-based print server are not configured to handle BSD protocol extensions. lp handles
print requests sent to such printers in the following ways: 1. Print requests with more than 52 filenames are truncat<hy>
ed to 52 files. 2. The -f, -H, -o, -P, -p, -q, -S, -T, and -y options might require a protocol extension to pass to a print
server. If lp cannot handle the print request, it displays a warning message.
LP administrators enable protocol extensions by setting a printer's printer-uri-supported (or bsdaddr) entry in
/etc/printers.conf. Changing the printer-uri-supported entry in /etc/printers.conf to:
 printer-uri-supported=lpd\://server/printers/destination#Solaris
 bsdaddr=server,destination,Solaris
Adding Solaris to either of these values causes the lp command to generate a set of BSD print protocol extensions
that can be processed by a Solaris print server.
As a result of several limitations in the BSD print protocol, it is recommended that the IPP protocol be used for com<hy>
munication with print servers.
When IPP is in use, the user is prompted for a passphrase if the remote print service is configured to require authen<hy>
tication.
