usb_ah <-> USB audio HID STREAMS module
The usb_ah STREAMS module enables the USB input control device which is a member of the Human Interface
Device (HID) class and provides support for volume change and mute button. The usb_ah module is pushed on top
of a HID class driver instance (see hid(7D)) and below an Audio Control class driver instance (see usb_ac(7D)). It
translates the HID specific events to the events that are supported by the Solaris audio mixer framework.
