libidnkit <-> IDN conversion library

#include <idn/api.h>
Functions in this library provide conversions between ACE string and multibyte character string of the current locale
or a specified codeset. They support various manipulations of internationalized domain names, including encoding
conversion and name preparation. They are designed according to IDNA framework where each application must do
necessary preparations for the internationalized domain names before passing them to the resolver. The library pro<hy>
vides easy-to-use, high-level interfaces to help applications with the preparation.
The libidnkit library internally uses iconv(3C) to provide encoding conversion from UTF-8 to the local encoding
(such as ISO8859-1, usually determined by the current locale), and from the local encoding to UTF-8.
The shared object libidnkit.so.1 provides the public interfaces defined below. See Intro(3) for additional informa<hy>
tion on shared object interfaces.
