sys-unconfig <-> undo a system's configuration
/usr/sbin/sys-unconfig
The sys-unconfig command is used to restore a system's configuration to an "as-manufactured" state, ready to be re<hy>
configured again. The system's configuration consists of hostname, Network Information Service (NIS) domain
name, timezone, IP address, IP subnet mask, and root password. This operation is the inverse of those performed by
the sysidnet(1M), sysidns(1M), and sysidsys(1M) programs run at boot. See sysidtool(1M).
sys-unconfig does the following: <bu> Saves current /etc/inet/hosts file information in /etc/inet/hosts.saved. <bu> If the
current /etc/vfstab file contains NFS mount entries, saves the /etc/vfstab file to /etc/vfstab.orig. <bu> Restores the de<hy>
fault /etc/inet/hosts file. <bu> Removes the default hostname in /etc/hostname.interface files for all interfaces config<hy>
ured when this command is run. To determine which interfaces are configured, run the command 'ifconfig-a'. The
/etc/hostname.interface files corresponding to all of the interfaces listed in the resulting output, with the exception
of the loopback interface (lo0), will be removed. <bu> Removes the default domainname in /etc/defaultdomain. <bu> Re<hy>
stores the timezone to PST8PDT in /etc/TIMEZONE. <bu> Disables the Network Information Service (NIS) and Net<hy>
work Information Service Plus (NIS+) if either NIS or NIS+ was configured. <bu> Removes the file /etc/inet/netmasks.
<bu> Removes the file /etc/defaultrouter. <bu> Removes the password set for root in /etc/shadow. <bu> Removes the file
/etc/.rootkey. <bu> Executes all system configuration applications. These applications are defined by prior executions
of a sysidconfig -a application. (See sysidconfig(1M)). When sys-unconfig is run, all system configuration applica<hy>
tions are passed one argument, -u. <bu> Removes the file /etc/resolv.conf. <bu> Removes the file /etc/sysidcfg. <bu> Disables
LDAP by removing /var/ldap/ldap_client_cache, /var/ldap/ldap_client_file, /var/ldap/ldap_client_cred, and
/var/ldap/cachemgr.log. <bu> Regenerates keys for sshd(1M).
When sys-unconfig is finished, it performs a system shutdown. sys-unconfig is a potentially dangerous utility and
can only be run by the super user.
