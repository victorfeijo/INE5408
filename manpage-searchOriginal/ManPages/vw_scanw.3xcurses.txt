int vw_scanw(WINDOW *win, char *fmt, va_list varglist);
fmt Is a scanf() format string.
varglist Is a pointer to a list of parameters.
win Is a pointer to the window in which the character is to be read.
The vw_scanw() function achieves the same effect as wscanw(3XCURSES) using a variable argument list. The
third argument is a va_list, as defined in <stdarg.h>.
Upon successful completion, vw_scanw() returns OK. Otherwise, it returns ERR.
No errors are defined.
The vw_scanw() function is preferred over vwscanw(3XCURSES). The use of the vwscanw() and vw_scanw() in
the same file will not work, due to the requirements to include <varargs.h> and <stdarg.h>, which both contain
definitions of va_list.
