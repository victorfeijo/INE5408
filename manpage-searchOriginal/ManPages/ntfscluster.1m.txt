ntfscluster <-> identify files in a specified region of an NTFS volume
ntfscluster [options] device
The ntfscluster utility has three modes of operation: info, sector, and cluster, described as follows.
Info
The default mode, info is currently not implemented. It will display general information about the NTFS volume
when it is working.
Sector
The sector mode displays a list of files that have data in the specified range of sectors. This mode is put in effect by
the --sector option.
Cluster
The cluster mode displays a list of files that have data in the specified range of clusters. When the cluster size is one
sector, this is equivalent to the sector mode of operation. This mode is put in effect by the --cluster option.
Supported options are listed below. Most options have both single-letter and full-name forms. Multiple single-letter
options that do not take an argument can be combined. For example, -fv is the equivalent of -f -v. A full-name option
can be abbreviated to a unique prefix of its name.
-c, --cluster range
Any files whose data is in this range of clusters will be displayed.
-F, --filename filename
Display information about filename.
-f, --force
Overrides some sensible defaults, such as not working with a mounted volume. Use this option with caution.
-h, --help
Show a list of options with a brief description of each.
-I, --inode num
Show information about this inode.
-i, --info
This option is not yet implemented.
-q, --quiet
Suppress some debug, warning, and error messages.
-s, --sector range
Any files whose data is in this range of sectors will be displayed.
-V, --version
Show the version number, copyright, and license information.

-v, --verbose
Display more debug, warning, and error messages.
Example 1 Displaying Information About a Volume
The following command displays information about the volume /dev/dsk/c0d0p1.
 # ntfscluster /dev/dsk/c0d0p1
Example 2 Displaying List of Files in a Cluster Range
The following command looks for files in the first 500 clusters of /dev/dsk/c0d0p1.
 # ntfscluster -c 0-500 /dev/dsk/c0d0p1
