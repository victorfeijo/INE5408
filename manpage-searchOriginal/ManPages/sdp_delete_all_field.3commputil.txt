int sdp_delete_all_field(sdp_session_t *session,
 const char field);
int sdp_delete_all_media_field(sdp_media_t *media,
 const char field);
The sdp_delete_all_field() function deletes all the occurrences of the specified SDP field from the session structure.
For example, if the session structure has 3 bandwidth (b=) fields, then when this function is called with
SDP_BANDWIDTH_FIELD, all the three bandwidth fields are deleted from the session structure.
The sdp_delete_all_media_field() function deletes all the occurrences of the specified SDP field from the specified
media structure. For example, if the caller wants to delete all the attribute fields in a media structure, calling this
function with SDP_ATTRIBUTE_FIELD argument would delete all the attribute fields in the media structure.
Upon successful completion, these functions return 0. Otherwise, the appropriate error value is returned. The value
of errno is not changed by these calls in the event of an error.
These functions will fail if:
EINVAL The session or media argument is NULL or the field type is unknown.
