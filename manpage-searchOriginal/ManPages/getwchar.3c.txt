getwchar <-> get wide character from stdin stream
#include <wchar.h>
wint_t getwchar(void)
The getwchar() function is equivalent to getwc(stdin).
Refer to fgetwc(3C).
Refer to fgetwc(3C).
If the wint_t value returned by getwchar() is stored into a variable of type wchar_t and then compared against the
wint_t macro WEOF, the comparison may never succeed because wchar_t is defined as unsigned.
