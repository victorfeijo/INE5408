t_look <-> look at the current event on a transport endpoint
#include <xti.h>
int t_look(int fd);
This routine is part of the XTI interfaces which evolved from the TLI interfaces. XTI represents the future evolution
of these interfaces. However, TLI interfaces are supported for compatibility. When using a TLI routine that has the
same name as an XTI routine, the tiuser.h header file must be used. Refer to the TLI COMPATIBILITY section
for a description of differences between the two interfaces.
This function returns the current event on the transport endpoint specified by fd. This function enables a transport
provider to notify a transport user of an asynchronous event when the user is calling functions in synchronous mode.
Certain events require immediate notification of the user and are indicated by a specific error, TLOOK, on the cur<hy>
rent or next function to be executed.
This function also enables a transport user to poll a transport endpoint periodically for asynchronous events.
Upon success, t_look() returns a value that indicates which of the allowable events has occurred, or returns zero if
no event exists. One of the following events is returned:
T_LISTEN Connection indication received.
T_CONNECT Connect confirmation received.
T_DATA Normal data received.
T_EXDATA Expedited data received.
T_DISCONNECT Disconnection received.
T_UDERR Datagram error indication.
T_ORDREL Orderly release indication.
T_GODATA Flow control restrictions on normal data flow that led to a TFLOW error have been lifted. Normal data
may be sent again.
T_GOEXDATA Flow control restrictions on expedited data flow that led to a TFLOW error have been lifted. Expe<hy>
dited data may be sent again.
On failure, -1 is returned and t_errno is set to indicate the error.
ALL - apart from T_UNINIT.
On failure, t_errno is set to one of the following:
TBADF The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.
TPROTO This error indicates that a communication problem has been detected between XTI and the transport
provider for which there is no other suitable XTI error (t_errno).

TSYSERR A system error has occurred during execution of this function.
The XTI and TLI interface definitions have common names but use different header files. This, and other semantic
differences between the two interfaces are described in the subsections below.
The XTI interfaces use the header file, xti.h. TLI interfaces should not use this header. They should use the header:
 #include <tiuser.h>
The return values that are defined by the XTI interface and cannot be returned by the TLI interface are:
 T_GODATA
 T_GOEXDATA
The t_errno value that can be set by the XTI interface and cannot be set by the TLI interface is:
 TPROTO
