pam_list <-> PAM account management module for UNIX
 pam_list.so.1
The pam_list module implements pam_sm_acct_mgmt(3PAM), which provides functionality to the PAM account
management stack. The module provides functions to validate that the user's account is valid on this host based
on a list of users and/or netgroups in the given file. The users and netgroups are separated by newline character. Net<hy>
groups are specified with character '@' as prefix before name of netgroup in the list. The maximum line lenght is
1023 characters.
The username is the value of PAM_USER. The host is the value of PAM_RHOST or, if PAM_RHOST is not set,
the value of the localhost as returned by gethostname(3C) is used.
If neither of the allow, deny, or compat options are specified, the module will look for +/- entries in the local
/etc/passwd file. If this style is used, nsswitch.conf(4) must not be configured with compat for the passwd data<hy>
base. If no relevant +/- entry exists for the user, pam_list is not participating in result.
If compat option is specified then the module will look for +/- entries in the local /etc/passwd file. Other entries in
this file will be counted as + entries. If no relevant entry exits for the user, pam_list will deny the access.
The following options can be passed to the module:
allow= The full pathname to a file of allowed users and/or netgroups. Only one of allow= or deny= can be specified.
compat Activate compat mode.
deny= The full pathname to a file of denied users and/or netgroups. Only one of deny= or allow= can be specified.
debug Provide syslog(3C) debugging information at the LOG_AUTH | LOG_DEBUG level.
user The module should only perform netgroup matches on the username. This is the default option.
nouser The username should not be used in the netgroup match.
host Only the host should be used in netgroup matches.
nohost The hostname should not be used in netgroup matches.
user_host_exact The user and hostname must be in the same netgroup.
The following error values are returned:
PAM_SERVICE_ERR An invalid set of module options was given in the pam.conf(4) for this module, or the us<hy>
er/netgroup file could not be opened.
PAM_BUF_ERR A memory buffer error occurred.
PAM_IGNORE The module is ignored, as it is not participating in the result.
PAM_PERM_DENIED The user is not on the allow list or is on the deny list.
PAM_SUCCESS The account is valid for use at this time.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN No account is present for the user
Example 1 Using pam_list in default mode
/etc/pam.conf modification looks like:
 other account requisite pam_roles.so.1
 other account required pam_unix_account.so.1
 other account required pam_list.so.1
In the case of default mode or compat mode, the important lines in /etc/passwd appear as follows:
 +loginname - user is approved
 -loginname - user is disapproved
 +@netgroup - netgroup members are approved
 -@netgroup - netgroup members are disapproved
Example 2 Using pam_list with allow file
/etc/pam.conf modification looks like:
 other account requisite pam_roles.so.1
 other account required pam_unix_account.so.1
 other account required pam_list.so.1 allow=etc/user.allow
/etc/users.allow contains:
 root
 localloginname
 remoteloginname
 @netgroup
