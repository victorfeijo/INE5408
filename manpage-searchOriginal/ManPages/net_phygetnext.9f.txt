net_phygetnext <-> search through the current list of network interfaces
#include <sys/neti.h>
phy_if_t net_phygetnext(const net_data_t net, const phy_if_t ifp);
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
net value returned from a successful call to net_protocol_lookup(9F).
ifp value returned from a successful call to this function or net_phylookup(9F).
The net_phygetnext() function searches through all of the network interfaces that a network protocol "owns". To
start searching through all of the interfaces owned by a protocol, a value of 0 should be passed through as the value
of ifp. When 0 is returned by this function, the last of the interfaces owned by this protocol has been reached.
When called successfully, the value returned represents a network interface that exists, at the time of the call, within
the scope of the network interface. This value is only guaranteed to be unique for a name within the scope of the net<hy>
work protocol.
  net_data_t net;
  phy_if_t ifp;
  char buffer[32];
  net = net_protocol_lookup("inet");
  if (net != NULL) {
  for (ifp = net_phygetnext(net, 0); ifp != 0;
  ifp = net_phygetnext(net, ifp)) {
  /* Do something with ifp */
  if (net_getifname(net, ifp, buffer,
  sizeof(buffer) >= 0)
  printf("Interface %s0, buffer);
  }
  }
The net_phygetnext() function returns -1 if it is not supported by the network protocol or 0 if an attempt to go be<hy>
yond the last network interface is made. Otherwise, it returns a value representing a network interface.
The net_phygetnext() function may be called from user, kernel, or interrupt context.
