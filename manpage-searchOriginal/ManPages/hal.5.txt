hal <-> overview of hardware abstraction layer
The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) provides a view of the various hardware attached to a system. This view is
updated dynamically as hardware configuration changes by means of hotplug or other mechanisms. HAL represents
a piece of hardware as a device object. A device object is identified by a unique identifer and carries a set of key/val<hy>
ue pairs, referred to as device properties. Some properties are derived from the actual hardware, some are merged
from device information files (.fdi files), and some are related to the actual device configuration.
HAL provides an easy-to-use API through D-Bus. D-Bus is an IPC framework that, among other features, provides a
system-wide message-bus that allows applications to talk to one another. Specifically, D-Bus provides asynchronous
notification such that HAL can notify other peers on the message-bus when devices are added and removed, as well
as when properties on a device are changing.
In the Solaris operating system, HAL is supported by a daemon, hald(1M), and a set of utilities that enable the
adding and removing of devices and the modification of their properties.
