dtappsession <-> start a new Application Manager session
/usr/dt/bin/dtappsession [hostname]
dtappsession is a specialized version of the Xsession shell script. It is an alternative to using the CDE remote login
that allows you to access a remote host without logging out of your current CDE session. dtappsession starts a new
instance of the CDE Application Manager in its own ToolTalkTM session. It can be used to remotely display the Ap<hy>
plication Manager back to your local display after logging in to a remote host with the rlogin(1) command.
A new, independent instance of ttsession(1) starts a simple session management window. This window displays the
title
 remote_hostname: Remote Administration
where remote_hostname is the system that is being accessed. The window also displays an Exit button. Clicking Ex<hy>
it terminates the ToolTalk session and all windows that are part of the session.
The Application Manager that is displayed can be used to start remote CDE actions to run in this session. Exiting
the Application Manager does not terminate the session, and it is not recommended. Clicking Exit is the recom<hy>
mended way to end the session. To avoid confusing the remote CDE applications with local ones, it is recommended
that a new CDE workspace be created for clients in the remote session.
The hostname is not needed when the DISPLAY environment variable is set to the local hostname on the remote
host.
On a system that is configured with Trusted Extensions, dtappsession can be used for remote administration by ad<hy>
ministrative roles that have the ability to log in to the remote host.
dtappsession does not require any privilege, and it does not need to run on a system that is configured with Trusted
Extensions. When installed in /usr/dt/bin on a Solaris system, along with the startApp.ds file, dtappsession can be
used to administer the remote Solaris system from a local system that is configured with Trusted Extensions. Howev<hy>
er, in this case, the CDE workspace that is used for remote display must be a normal workspace, rather than a role
workspace. Example 1 Remote Login and dtappsession
After creating a new CDE workspace, type the following in a terminal window:
 # rlogin remote_hostname
 password: /*type the remote password*/
 # dtappsession local_hostname /* on the remote host */

X11/CDE applications that do not register with the ToolTalk session manager will not exit automatically when the
session is terminated. Such applications must be explicitly terminated.
