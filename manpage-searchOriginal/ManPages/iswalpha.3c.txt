These functions test whether wc is a wide-character code representing a character of a particular class defined in the
LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.
In all cases, wc is a wint_t, the value of which must be a wide-character code corresponding to a valid character in
the current locale or must equal the value of the macro WEOF. If the argument has any other values, the behavior is
undefined.
iswalpha(wc) Tests whether wc is a wide-character code representing a character of class "alpha" in the program's
current locale.
isenglish(wc) Tests whether wc is a wide-character code representing an English language character, excluding
ASCII characters.
isideogram(wc) Tests whether wc is a wide-character code representing an ideographic language character, exclud<hy>
ing ASCII characters.
isnumber(wc) Tests whether wc is a wide-character code representing digit [0<mi>9], excluding ASCII characters.
isphonogram(wc) Tests whether wc is a wide-character code representing a phonetic language character, excluding
ASCII characters.
<beginning of page>
isspecial(wc) Tests whether wc is a wide-character code representing a special language character, excluding ASCII
characters.
iswalnum(wc) Tests whether wc is a wide-character code representing a character of class "alpha" or "digit" in the
program's current locale.
iswascii(wc) Tests whether wc is a wide-character code representing an ASCII character.
iswblank(wc) Tests whether wc is a wide-character code representing a character of class "blank" in the program's
current locale. This function is not available to applications conforming to standards prior to SUSv3. See stan<hy>
dards(5).
iswlower(wc) Tests whether wc is a wide-character code representing a character of class "lower" in the program's
current locale.
iswcntrl(wc) Tests whether wc is a wide-character code representing a character of class "cntrl" in the program's
current locale.
iswdigit(wc) Tests whether wc is a wide-character code representing a character of class "digit" in the program's cur<hy>
rent locale.
iswgraph(wc) Tests whether wc is a wide-character code representing a character of class "graph" in the program's
current locale.
iswprint(wc) Tests whether wc is a wide-character code representing a character of class "print" in the program's
current locale.
iswpunct(wc) Tests whether wc is a wide-character code representing a character of class "punct" in the program's
current locale.
iswspace(wc) Tests whether wc is a wide-character code representing a character of class "space" in the program's
current locale.
iswupper(wc) Tests whether wc is a wide-character code representing a character of class "upper" in the program's
current locale.
iswxdigit(wc) Tests whether wc is a wide-character code representing a character of class "xdigit" in the program's
current locale.
