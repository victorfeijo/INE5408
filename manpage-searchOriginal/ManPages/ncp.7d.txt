ncp <-> UltraSPARC T1 server crypto provider device driver
The ncp device driver is a multi-threaded, loadable hardware driver supporting hardware assisted acceleration of
RSA and DSA cryptographic operations. This support is built into the UltraSPARC T1 processor.
The ncp driver requires the presence of the Solaris Cryptographic Framework to enable applications and kernel
clients to access the provided services.
You configure the ncp driver by defining properties in /platform/sun4v/kernel/drv/ncp.conf which override the de<hy>
fault settings. The following property is supported:
nostats Disables the generation of statistics. The nostats property may be used to help prevent traffic analysis, but
this may inhibit support personnel.
Solaris network drivers must implement statistics variables. The ncp driver maintains the following statistics:
mauXqfull Number of times the queue for MAU X was found full when attempting to submit jobs.
mauXupdate_failure Number of submit job failures on MAU X.
mauXsubmit Number of jobs submitted to MAU X since driver load (boot).
rsapublic Total number of jobs submitted to the device for RSA public key operations.
rsaprivate Total number of jobs submitted to the device for RSA private key operations.
dsasign Total number of jobs submitted to the device for DSA signing.
dsaverify Total number of jobs submitted to the device for DSA verification.
Additional statistics may be supplied for Sun support personnel, but are not useful to Solaris users and are not doc-
umented in this manpage.
