pullupmsg <-> concatenate bytes in a message
#include <sys/stream.h>
int pullupmsg(mblk_t *mp, ssize_t len);
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI).
mp Pointer to the message whose blocks are to be concatenated. mblk_t is an instance of the msgb(9S) structure.
len Number of bytes to concatenate.
The pullupmsg() function tries to combine multiple data blocks into a single block. pullupmsg() concatenates and
aligns the first len data bytes of the message pointed to by mp. If len equals -1, all data are concatenated. If len bytes
of the same message type cannot be found, pullupmsg() fails and returns 0.
On success, 1 is returned; on failure, 0 is returned.
The pullupmsg() function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context. Example 1 Using pullupmsg()
This is a driver write srv(9E) (service) routine for a device that does not support scatter/gather DMA. For all
M_DATA messages, the data will be transferred to the device with DMA. First, try to pull up the message into one
message block with the pullupmsg() function (line 12). If successful, the transfer can be accomplished in one DMA
job. Otherwise, it must be done one message block at a time (lines 19-22). After the data has been transferred to the
device, free the message and continue processing messages on the queue.

STREAMS Programming Guide
The pullupmsg() function is not included in the DKI and will be removed from the system in a future release. De<hy>
vice driver writers are strongly encouraged to use msgpullup(9F) instead of pullupmsg().
