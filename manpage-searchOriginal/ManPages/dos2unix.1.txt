dos2unix <-> convert text file from DOS format to ISO format
dos2unix [-ascii] [-iso] [-7]
 [-437 | -850 | -860 | -863 | -865] originalfile convertedfile
The dos2unix utility converts characters in the DOS extended character set to the corresponding ISO standard char<hy>
acters.
This command can be invoked from either DOS or SunOS. However, the filenames must conform to the conventions
of the environment in which the command is invoked.
If the original file and the converted file are the same, dos2unix will rewrite the original file after converting it.
The following options are supported:
-ascii Removes extra carriage returns and converts end of file characters in DOS format text files to conform to
SunOS requirements.
-iso This is the default. It converts characters in the DOS extended character set to the corresponding ISO standard
characters.
-7 Converts 8 bit DOS graphics characters to 7 bit space characters so that SunOS can read the file.
On non-i386 systems, dos2unix will attempt to obtain the keyboard type to determine which code page to use. Oth<hy>
erwise, the default is US. The user may override the code page with one of the following options:
-437 Use US code page
-850 Use multilingual code page
-860 Use Portuguese code page
-863 Use French Canadian code page
-865 Use Danish code page
The following operands are required:
originalfile The original file in DOS format that is being converted to ISO format.
convertedfile The new file in ISO format that has been converted from the original DOS file format.

File filename not found, or no read permission
The input file you specified does not exist, or you do not have read permission. Check with the SunOS command, ls
-l (see ls(1)).
<beginning of page>
Bad output filename filename, or no write permission
The output file you specified is either invalid, or you do not have write permission for that file or the directory that
contains it. Check also that the drive or diskette is not write-protected.
Error while writing to temporary file
An error occurred while converting your file, possibly because there is not enough space on the current drive. Check
the amount of space on the current drive using the DIR command. Also be certain that the default diskette or drive is
write-enabled (not write-protected). Notice that when this error occurs, the original file remains intact.
Translated temporary file name = filename.
Could not rename temporary file to filename.
The program could not perform the final step in converting your file. Your converted file is stored under the name in<hy>
dicated on the second line of this message.
