scsa1394 <-> SCSI to 1394 bridge driver
unit@GUID
The scsa1394 driver is a 1394 target and an SCSA HBA driver that supports 1394 mass storage devices compliant
with the Serial Bus Protocol 2 (SBP-2) specification. It supports both bus-powered and self-powered 1394 mass stor<hy>
age devices.
The scsa1394 nexus driver maps SCSA target driver requests to SBP-2 Operation Request Blocks (ORB's).
The scsa1394 driver creates a child device info node for each logical unit (LUN) on the mass storage device. The
standard Solaris SCSI disk driver is attached to those nodes. Refer to sd(7D).
This driver supports multiple LUN devices and creates a separate child device info node for each LUN. All child
LUN nodes attach to sd(7D).
In previous releases, all 1394 mass storage devices were treated as removable media devices and managed by rmfor<hy>
mat(1) and volume management software. In the current release, however, only mass storage devices with a remov<hy>
able bit (RMB) value of 1 are removable. (The RMB is part of the device's SCSI INQUIRY data.) See SCSI specifi<hy>
cations T10/995D Revision 11a, T10/1236-D Revision 20 or T10/1416-D Revision 23 for more information. How<hy>
ever, for backward compatibility, all 1394 mass storage devices can still be managed by rmformat(1). With or with<hy>
out a volume manager, you can mount, eject, hot remove and hot insert a 1394 mass storage device as the follow<hy>
ing sections explain.
Mass storage devices are managed by a volume manager. Software that manages removable media creates a device
nickname that can be listed with eject(1) or rmmount(1). A device that is not mounted automatically can be mount<hy>
ed using rmmount(1) under /rmdisk/label. Note that the mount(1M) and mount(1M) commands do not accept
nicknames; you must use explicit device names with these commands.
See rmmount(1) to unmount the device and eject(1) to eject the media. If the device is ejected while it is mounted,
volume management software unmounts the device before ejecting it. It also might kill any active applications that
are accessing the device.
Volume management software is hotplug-aware and normally mounts file systems on USB mass storage devices if
the file system is recognized. Before hot removing the USB device, use eject(1) to unmount the file system.
You can disable the automatic mounting and unmounting of removable devices by inserting a entry for a removable
device in /etc/vfstab. In this entry, you must set the mount at boot field to no. See vfstab(4). See the System Admin<hy>
istration Guide, Volume I and Solaris Common Desktop Environment: User's Guide for details on how to manage a
removable device with CDE and Removable Media Manager. See dtfile.1X under CDE for information on how to
use Removable Media Manager.
Use mount(1M) to explicitly mount the device and umount(1M) to unmount the device. Use eject(1) to eject the
media. After you have explicitly mounted a removable device, you cannot use a nickname as an argument to eject.
Removing the storage device while it is being accessed or mounted fails with a console warning. To hot remove the
storage device from the system, unmount the file system, then kill all applications accessing the device. Next, hot re<hy>
move the device. A storage device can be hot inserted at any time.
For a comprehensive listing of (non-bootable) 1394 mass-storage devices that are compatible with this driver, see
www.sun.com/io.
Block special file names are located in /dev/dsk. Raw file names are located in /dev/rdsk. Input/output requests to
the devices must follow the same restrictions as those for SCSI disks. Refer to sd(7D).
Refer to cdio(7I) and dkio(7I).
Refer to sd(7D).
The device special files for the 1394 mass storage device are created like those for a SCSI disk. Refer to sd(7D).
