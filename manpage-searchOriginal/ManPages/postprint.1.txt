The postprint filter translates text files into PostScript and writes the results on the standard output. If no files are
specified, or if <mi> is one of the input files, the standard input is read.
-c num Print num copies of each page. By default, only one copy is printed.
-f name Print files using font name. Any PostScript font can be used, although the best results will be obtained only
with constant width fonts. The default font is Courier.
-l num Set the length of a page to num lines. By default, num is 66. Setting num to 0 is allowed, and will cause post<hy>
print to guess a value, based on the point size that's being used.
-m num Magnify each logical page by the factor num. Pages are scaled uniformly about the origin, which is located
near the upper left corner of each page. The default magnification is 1.0.
-n num Print num logical pages on each piece of paper, where num can be any positive integer. By default, num is set
to 1.
-o list Print pages whose numbers are given in the comma-separated list. The list contains single numbers N and
ranges N1 <mi> N2. A missing N1 means the lowest numbered page, a missing N2 means the highest. The page range is
an expression of logical pages rather than physical sheets of paper. For example, if you are printing two logical
pages to a sheet, and you specified a range of 4, then two sheets of paper would print, containing four page lay<hy>
outs. If you specified a page range of 3-4, when requesting two logical pages to a sheet; then only page 3 and page
4 layouts would print, and they would appear on one physical sheet of paper.
-p mode Print files in either portrait or landscape mode. Only the first character of mode is significant. The default
mode is portrait.
-r num Selects carriage return behavior. Carriage returns are ignored if num is 0, cause a return to column 1 if num
is 1, and generate a newline if num is 2. The default num is 0.
-s num Print files using point size num. When printing in landscape mode num is scaled by a factor that depends on
the imaging area of the device. The default size for portrait mode is 10. Note that increasing point size increases vir<hy>
tual image size, so you either need to load larger paper, or use the <mi>l0 option to scale the number of lines per page.
-t num Assume tabs are set every num columns, starting with the first column. By default, tabs are set every 8 col<hy>
umns.
-x num Translate the origin num inches along the positive x axis. The default coordinate system has the origin fixed
near the upper left corner of the page, with positive x to the right and positive y down the page. Positive num moves
everything to the right. The default offset is 0.25 inches.
-y num Translate the origin num inches along the positive y axis. Positive num moves text up the page. The default
offset is <mi>0.25 inches.
A new logical page is started after 66 lines have been printed on the current page, or whenever an ASCII form feed
character is read. The number of lines per page can be changed using the -l option. Unprintable ASCII characters are
<beginning of page>
ignored, and lines that are too long are silently truncated by the printer. Example 1 Examples of postprint.
To print file1 and file2 in landscape mode, issue the following command:
 example% postprint -pland file1 file2
To print three logical pages on each physical page in portrait mode:
 example% postprint -n3 file
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
non-zero An error occurred.
