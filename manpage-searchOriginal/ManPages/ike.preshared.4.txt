ike.preshared <-> pre-shared keys file for IKE
/etc/inet/secret/ike.preshared
 The /etc/inet/secret/ike.preshared file contains secret keying material that two IKE instances can use to authenti<hy>
cate each other. Because of the sensitive nature of this data, it is kept in the /etc/inet/secret directory, which is only
accessible by root.
Pre-shared keys are delimited by open-curly-brace ({) and close-curly-brace (}) characters. There are five name-val<hy>
ue pairs required inside a pre-shared key:
tab(); cw(1.83i) cw(1.83i) cw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) lw(1.83i) NameValueExample localidtypeIPlocalidtype IP

Comment lines with # appearing in the first column are also legal.
Files in this format can also be used by the ikeadm(1M) command to load additional pre-shared keys into a running
an in.iked(1M) process. Example 1 A Sample ike.preshared File
The following is an example of an ike.preshared file:
 #
 # Two pre-shared keys between myself, 10.1.1.2, and two remote
 # hosts. Note that names are not allowed for IP addresses.
 #
 # A decent hex string can be obtained by performing:
 # od -x </dev/random | head
 #

 }
If this file is compromised, all IPsec security associations derived from secrets in this file will be compromised as
well. The default permissions on ike.preshared are 0600. They should stay this way.
