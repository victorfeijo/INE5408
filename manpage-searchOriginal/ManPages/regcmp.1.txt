regcmp <-> regular expression compile
regcmp [-] filename...
The regcmp command performs a function similar to regcmp and, in most cases, precludes the need for calling
regcmp from C programs. Bypassing regcmp saves on both execution time and program size. The command
regcmp compiles the regular expressions in filename and places the output in filename.i.
<mi> If the <mi> option is used, the output is placed in filename.c. The format of entries in filename is a name (C variable)
followed by one or more blanks followed by one or more regular expressions enclosed in double quotes. The output
of regcmp is C source code. Compiled regular expressions are represented as extern char vectors. filename.i files
may thus be #included in C programs, or filename.c files may be compiled and later loaded. In the C program that
uses the regcmp output, regex(abc,line) applies the regular expression named abc to line. Diagnostics are self-ex<hy>
planatory.
Example 1 Examples of the regcmp command.
name "([A<mi>Za<mi>z][A<mi>Za<mi>z0<mi>9_]*)$0"
telno "\({0,1}([2<mi>9][01][1<mi>9])$0\){0,1} *"
"([2<mi>9][0<mi>9]{2})$1[ <mi>]{0,1}"
"([0<mi>9]{4})$2"
The three arguments to telno shown above must all be entered on one line.
In the C program that uses the regcmp output,
  regex(telno, line, area, exch, rest)
applies the regular expression named telno to line.
A general description of the usage of the LC_* environmental variables can be found in environ(5).
LC_CTYPE Determines how regcmp handles characters. When LC_CTYPE is set to a valid value, regcmp can
display and handle text and filenames containing valid characters for that locale.
LC_MESSAGES Determines how diagnostic and informative messages are presented. This includes the language
and style of the messages, and the correct form of affirmative and negative responses. In the "C" locale, the mes<hy>
sages are presented in the default form found in the program itself (in most cases, U.S. English).
