int ptree_get_prop_by_name(picl_nodehdl_t nodeh, char *name,
 picl_prophdl_t *proph);
The ptree_get_prop_by_name() function gets the handle of the property, whose name is specified in name, of the
node specified by the handle nodeh. The property handle is copied into the location specified by proph.
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. On failure, a non-negative integer is returned to indicate an error.
PICL_RESERVEDNAME is returned if the name specified is a PICL reserved name property. Reserved name
properties do not have an associated property handle. Use ptree_get_propval_by_name(3PICLTREE) to get the
value of a reserved property.
PICL_STALEHANDLE is returned if the handle is no longer valid. This occurs if the PICL tree was refreshed or
reinitialized.
PICL_INVALIDHANDLE is returned if the specified handle never existed.
PICL_NOTNODE Not a node
PICL_RESERVEDNAME Property name is reserved
PICL_INVALIDHANDLE Invalid handle
PICL_STALEHANDLE Stale handle
PICL_PROPNOTFOUND Property not found
PICL_FAILURE General system failure
