lgrp_view_t lgrp_view(lgrp_cookie_t cookie);
The lgrp_view() function takes a cookie representing the snapshot of the lgroup hierarchy obtained from
lgrp_init(3LGRP) and returns the snapshot's view of the lgroup hierarchy.
If the given view is LGRP_VIEW_CALLER, the snapshot contains only the resources that are available to the call<hy>
er (such as those with respect to processor sets). When the view is LGRP_VIEW_OS, the snapshot contains what
is available to the operating system.
Upon succesful completion, lgrp_view() returns the view for the snapshot of the lgroup hierarchy represented by the
given cookie. Otherwise, <mi>1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
The lgrp_view() function will fail if:
EINVAL The cookie is not valid.
