double tan(double x);
float tanf(float x);
long double tanl(long double x);
These functions compute the tangent of their argument x, measured in radians.
Upon successful completion, these functions return the tangent of x.
If x is NaN, a NaN is returned.
If x is <+->0, x is returned.
If x is <+->Inf, a domain error occurs and a NaN is returned.
These functions will fail if:
Domain Error The value of x is <+->Inf.
If the integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, the invalid floating-point ex<hy>
ception is raised.
There are no known floating-point representations such that for a normal argument, tan(x) is either overflow or un<hy>
derflow.
An application wanting to check for exceptions should call feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these
functions. On return, if fetestexcept(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDER<hy>
FLOW) is non-zero, an exception has been raised. An application should either examine the return value or check
the floating point exception flags to detect exceptions.
