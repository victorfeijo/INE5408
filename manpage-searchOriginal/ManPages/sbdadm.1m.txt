The sbdadm command creates and manages SCSI-block-device-based logical units that are registered with the SCSI
Target Mode Framework (STMF).
The sbdadm command supports the subcommands listed below. Note that if you enter a question mark as an argu<hy>
ment to the command (sbdadm ?), sbdadm responds with a help display.
create-lu [-s, --size size] filename
Create a logical unit that can be registered with the STMF. For the -s option, size is an integer followed by one of the
following letters, to indicate a unit of size:
k kilobyte
m megabyte
g gigabyte
t terabyte
p petabyte
e exabyte
If you do not specify size, the size defaults to the size of filename.
The size specified can exceed the size of the file or device.
delete-lu lu_name
Deletes an existing logical unit that was created using sbdadm create-lu. This effectively unloads the logical unit
from the STMF framework. Any existing data on the logical unit remains intact.
import-lu lu_name
Imports and loads a logical unit into the STMF that was previously created using sbdadm create-lu and was since
deleted from the STMF using sbdadm delete-lu. On success, the logical unit is again made available to the STMF.
filename is the filename used in the sbdadm create-lu command for this logical unit.
list-lu
List all logical units that were created using the sbdadm create-lu command.
modify-lu [-s, --size size] lu_name | filename
Modifies attributes of an logical unit created using the sbdadm create-lu command. For the -s option, size is an inte<hy>
ger value followed by a unit specifier. The unit specifiers are as described above under create-lu. When this option is
specified, the existing size of the logical unit is changed to the new size.
<beginning of page>
The size specified can exceed the size of the file or device represented by lu_name.
sbdadm use the following operands:
filename
Name of an existing file or a fully qualified path to a raw block device.
lu_name
The 32-byte hexadecimal representation of the logical unit.
Example 1 Creating a Logical Unit
The following series of commands creates a 10-gigabyte logical unit.
 # touch /export/lun/0
 # sbdadm create-lu -s 10g /export/lun/0
 # sbdadm create-lu /dev/rdsk/c1t1d0s0
Example 2 Listing Logical Units
The following command lists all logical units.
 # sbdadm list-lu
