net_inject_t <-> structure for describing how to transmit a packet
#include <sys/neti.h>
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
The net_inject_t data structure passes information in to net_inject about how to transmit a packet. Transmit in<hy>
cludes sending the packet up into the system as well as out of it.
  mblk_t *ni_packet; /* start of the packet */
  struct sockaddr_storage ni_addr; /* address of next hop */
  phy_if_t ni_physical; /* network interface to use */
ni_packet Pointer to the first the mblk_t data structure that makes up this packet.
ni_addr This field is only required to be initialized if NI_DIRECT_OUT is being used to transmit the packet. The
sockaddr_storage field must be set to indicate whether the destination address contained in the structure is IPv4
(cast ni_addr to struct sockaddr_in) or IPv6 (cast ni_addr to struct sockaddr_in6).
ni_physical The physical interface where the packet will be injected.
