 const mlib_s16 *coeffs);
The mlib_VideoIDCT8x8_S16_S16_DC() function can be used only when F(0,0) is nonzero. It computes the in<hy>
verse DCT (called IDCT) for the output IDCT block of data type mlib_s16 and input DCT coefficients of data type
mlib_s16. This function is not guaranteed to be IEEE-1180-compliant. The output of the IDCT routine is the differ<hy>
ence between the current block and the reference block. The difference pixel can occupy nine bits and is represented
as a 16-bit datum. The output must be added to the motion-compensated reference block in order to reconstruct the
current block.
The function takes the following arguments:
block Pointer to the current block. block must be 8-byte aligned.
coeffs Pointer to the source DCT coefficients. coeffs must be 8-byte aligned.
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
