fpsd <-> Fp-scrubber daemon
/usr/lib/fps/fpsd
fpsd is a user-level daemon that periodically runs non-intrusive tests to validate proper functioning of FPU (Floating
Point Unit) hardware in the system. A fault management action is initiated by means of fmd(1M), in case an error is
detected by the test.
The following exit values are returned:
0
Successful completion.
non-zero
An error occurred.
See attributes(5) for descriptions of the following attributes:

The fpsd service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/system/fpsd:default
You can use svccfg(1M) to change the default fpsd behavior:

 config/exclude_cpus astring comma delimited list of
  CPU IDs to be excluded
  from proactive testing.
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). The service's status can be queried using the svcs(1) command.
Disabling the service can increase system's vulnerability to silent data corruption, if a fault were to develop in an
FPU within the system.
