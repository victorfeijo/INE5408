killpg <-> send signal to a process group
#include <signal.h>
int killpg(pid_t pgrp, int sig);
The killpg() function sends the signal sig to the process group pgrp. See signal.h(3HEAD) for a list of signals.
The real or effective user ID of the sending process must match the real or saved set-user ID of the receiving
process, unless the effective user ID of the sending process is the privileged user. A single exception is the signal
SIGCONT, which may always be sent to any descendant of the current process.
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. Otherwise, <mi>1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
The killpg() function will fail and no signal will be sent if:
EINVAL The sig argument is not a valid signal number.
EPERM The effective user ID of the sending process is not privileged user, and neither its real nor effective user ID
matches the real or saved set-user ID of one or more of the target processes.
ESRCH No processes were found in the specified process group.
