gsscred [-n user [-o oid] [-u uid]] [-c comment] -m mech -a
gsscred [-n user [-o oid]] [-u uid] [-m mech] -r
gsscred [-n user [-o oid]] [-u uid] [-m mech] -l
The gsscred utility is used to create and maintain a mapping between a security principal name and a local UNIX
uid. The format of the user name is assumed to be GSS_C_NT_USER_NAME. You can use the -o option to specify
the object identifier of the name type. The OID must be specified in dot-separated notation, for example:
1.2.3.45464.3.1
The gsscred table is used on server machines to lookup the uid of incoming clients connected using RPCSEC_GSS.
When adding users, if no user name is specified, an entry is created in the table for each user from the passwd table.
If no comment is specified, the gsscred utility inserts a comment that specifies the user name as an ASCII string and
the GSS-APIsecurity mechanism that applies to it. The security mechanism will be in string representation as de<hy>
fined in the /etc/gss/mech file.
The parameters are interpreted the same way by the gsscred utility to delete users as they are to create users. At least
one of the following options must be specified: -n, -u, or -m. If no security mechanism is specified, then all entries
will be deleted for the user identified by either the uid or user name. If only the security mechanism is specified, then
all user entries for that security mechanism will be deleted.
Again, the parameters are interpreted the same way by the gsscred utility to search for users as they are to create
users. If no options are specified, then the entire table is returned. If the user name or uid is specified, then all entries
for that user are returned. If a security mechanism is specified, then all user entries for that security mechanism are
returned.
-a Add a table entry.
-c comment Insert comment about this table entry.
-l Search table for entry.
-m mech Specify the mechanism for which this name is to be translated.
-n user Specify the optional principal name.
-o oid Specify the OID indicating the name type of the user.
-r Remove the entry from the table.
-u uid Specify the uid for the user if the user is not local.
Example 1 Creating a gsscred Table for the Kerberos v5 Security Mechanism
The following shows how to create a gsscred table for the kerberos v5 security mechanism. gsscred obtains user
names and uid's from the passwd table to populate the table.
 example% gsscred -m kerberos_v5 -a
Example 2 Adding an Entry for root/host1 for the Kerberos v5 Security Mechanism
The following shows how to add an entry for root/host1 with a specified uid of 0 for the kerberos v5 security mech<hy>
anism.
<beginning of page>
 example% gsscred -m kerberos_v5 -n root/host1 -u 0 -a
Example 3 Listing All User Mappings for the Kerberos v5 Security Mechanism
The following lists all user mappings for the kerberos v5 security mechanism.
 example% gsscred -m kerberos_v5 -l
Example 4 Listing All Mappings for All Security Mechanism for a Specified User
The following lists all mappings for all security mechanisms for the user bsimpson.
 example% gsscred -n bsimpson -l
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred.

Some GSS mechanisms, such as kerberos_v5, provide their own authenticated-name-to-local-name (uid) mapping
and thus do not usually have to be mapped using gsscred. See gsscred.conf(4) for more information.
