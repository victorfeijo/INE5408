ftpgroups <-> FTP Server enhanced group access file
/etc/ftpd/ftpgroups
The ftpgroups file contains the enhanced group access information.
After login, if the ftpaccess(4) file includes private yes, the user may use the SITE GROUP and SITE GPASS
commands to specify an enhanced access group and a password for that group. If the access group name and pass<hy>
word are valid, the FTP Server executes setuid(2) to make the user a member of the real group listed in the ftp<hy>
groups file.
The format for the ftpgroups file is:
 accessgroup:encrypted_password:real_group_name
The fields are defined as follows:
accessgroup An arbitrary string of alphanumeric and punctuation characters.
encrypted_password The group password encrypted exactly like in /etc/shadow.
real_group_name The name of a valid group returned by getgrnam(3C).
The privatepw utility is an administrative tool to add, delete and list enhanced access group information in the ftp<hy>
groups file. See privatepw(1M). Lines that begin with a # sign are treated as comment lines and are ignored.
