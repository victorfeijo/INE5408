str Is a pointer to an object that can hold the retrieved multibyte character string.
n Is the number of characters not to exceed when retrieving str.
y Is the y (row) coordinate of the starting position of the string to be retrieved.
x Is the x (column) coordinate of the starting position of the string to be retrieved.
win Is a pointer to the window in which the string is to be retrieved.
The instr() and winstr() functions retrieve a multibyte character string (without attributes) starting at the current cur<hy>
sor position of the stdscr window and window win, respectively, and ending at the right margin. The mvinstr() and
mvwinstr() functions retrieve a multibyte character string located at the position indicated by the x (column) and y
(row) parameters (the former in the stdscr window; the latter in window win).
The innstr(), winnstr(), mvinnstr(), and mvwinnstr() functions retrieve at most n characters from the window
stdscr and win, respectively. The former two functions retrieve the string starting at the current cursor position; the
latter two commands return the string, starting at the position specified by the x and y parameters.
All these functions store the retrieved string in the object pointed to by str. They only store complete multibyte char<hy>
acters. If the area pointed to by str is not large enough to hold at least one character, these functions fail.
Only the character portion of the character/rendition pair is returned. To return the complete character/rendition
pair, use winchstr().
OK Successful completion.
ERR An error occurred.
All functions except winnstr() may be macros.
