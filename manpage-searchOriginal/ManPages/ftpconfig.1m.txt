ftpconfig <-> set up anonymous FTP
ftpconfig [ftpdir]
ftpconfig -d ftpdir
The ftpconfig script is executed by the super user to set up anonymous FTP. Anonymous FTP allows users to re<hy>
motely log on to the FTP server by specifying the user name ftp or anonymous and the user's email address as
password. The anonymous users are logged on to the FTP Server and given access to a restricted file area with its
own file system root. See chroot(2). The FTP area has its own minimal system files.
This command will copy and set up all the components needed to operate an anonymous FTP server, including cre<hy>
ating the ftp user account, creating device nodes, copying /usr/lib files, and copying timezone data. The passwd and
group files set up have been stripped down to prevent malicious users from finding login names on the server. The
anonymous file area will be placed under ftpdir. If the ftp user account already exists, then the current FTP area is
used, and the system files in it are updated. All other files are left untouched. This command should be run to update
the anonymous FTP area's configuration whenever a system patch is installed, or the system is upgraded.
-d Create a new or update an existing ftpdir without creating or updating the ftp user account. Use this option when
creating guest FTP user accounts.
The following operands are supported:
ftpdir The absolute pathname of the directory under which the anonymous FTP area is set up.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion
1 Improper usage of the command
2 Command failed
