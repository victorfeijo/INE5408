mount [-F tmpfs] [-o specific_options] [-O] special mount_point
tmpfs is a memory based file system which uses kernel resources relating to the VM system and page cache as a file
system.
mount attaches a tmpfs file system to the file system hierarchy at the pathname location mount_point, which must
already exist. If mount_point has any contents prior to the mount operation, these remain hidden until the file system
is once again unmounted. The attributes (mode, owner, and group) of the root of the tmpfs filesystem are inherited
from the underlying mount_point, provided that those attributes are determinable. If not, the root's attributes are set
to their default values.
The special argument is usually specified as swap but is in fact disregarded and assumed to be the virtual memory
resources within the system.
-o specific_options Specify tmpfs file system specific options in a comma-separated list with no intervening spaces.
If invalid options are specified, a warning message is printed and the invalid options are ignored. The following op<hy>
tions are available:
size=sz The sz argument controls the size of this particular tmpfs file system. If the argument is has a `k' suffix, the
number will be interpreted as a number of kilobytes. An `m' suffix will be interpreted as a number of megabytes. No
suffix is interpreted as bytes. In all cases, the actual size of the file system is the number of bytes specified, rounded
up to the physical pagesize of the system.
xattr | noxattr Allow or disallow the creation and manipulation of extended attributes. The default is xattr. See
fsattr(5) for a description of extended attributes.
-O Overlay mount. Allow the file system to be mounted over an existing mount point, making the underlying file
system inaccessible. If a mount is attempted on a pre-existing mount point without setting this flag, the mount will
fail, producing the errordevice busy.

If the directory on which a file system is to be mounted is a symbolic link, the file system is mounted on the directo<hy>
ry to which the symbolic link refers, rather than on top of the symbolic link itself.
