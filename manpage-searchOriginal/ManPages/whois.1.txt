whois [-h host] identifier
whois searches for an Internet directory entry for an identifier which is either a name (such as ``Smith'') or a handle
(such as ``SRI-NIC''). To force a name-only search, precede the name with a period; to force a handle-only search,
precede the handle with an exclamation point.
To search for a group or organization entry, precede the argument with * (an asterisk). The entire membership list of
the group will be displayed with the record.
You may of course use an exclamation point and asterisk, or a period and asterisk together. Example 1 Using The
whois Command
The command:
 example% whois Smith
looks for the name or handle SMITH.
The command:
 example% whois !SRI-NIC
looks for the handle SRI-NIC only.
The command:
 example% whois .Smith, John
looks for the name JOHN SMITH only.
Adding ... to the name or handle argument will match anything from that point; that is, ZU ... will match ZUL,
ZUM, and so on.
