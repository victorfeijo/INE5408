dscpmk <-> Differentiated Services Code Point Marker
The dscpmk marker is an action module that is executed as a result of classifying or metering packets. It sets a code<hy>
point in the IP header as defined in RFC-2474: Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4
and IPv6 Headers.
The dscpmk module exports the following statistics available through kstat:
Global statistics:
 module: dscpmk instance: <action id>
  name: dscpmk stats class <action name>
  crtime
  snaptime
  npackets <number of packets>
  epackets <number of packets in error>
  ipackets <number of packets not processed>
  dscp_unchanged <number of packets with DSCP unchanged>
  dscp_changed <number of packets with DSCP changed>
 Also, for each DSCP the following is exported:
  module: dscpmk instance: <action id>
  name: dscpmk_dscp0x<DSCP> value class: <action name>
  dscp <DSCP value>
  npackets <number of packets for this DSCP>
/kernel/ipp/sparcv9/dscpmk 64-bit module (SPARC only.)
