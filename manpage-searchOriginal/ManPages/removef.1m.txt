removef <-> remove a file from software database
removef [ [-M] -R root_path] [-V fs_file] pkginst path...
removef [ [-M] -R root_path] [-V fs_file] -f pkginst
removef informs the system that the user, or software, intends to remove a pathname. Output from removef is the
list of input pathnames that may be safely removed (no other packages have a dependency on them).
The following options are supported:
-f
After all files have been processed, removef should be invoked with the -f option to indicate that the removal phase
is complete.
-M
Instruct removef not to use the $root_path/etc/vfstab file for determining the client's mount points. This option as<hy>
sumes the mount points are correct on the server and it behaves consistently with Solaris 2.5 and earlier releases.
-R root_path
Define the full path name of a directory to use as the root_path. All files, including package system information files,
are relocated to a directory tree starting in the specified root_path. The root_path may be specified when installing to
a client from a server (for example, /export/root/client1).
removef inherits the value of the PKG_INSTALL_ROOT environment variable. (See ENVIRONMENT VARI<hy>
ABLES, below.) If PKG_INSTALL_ROOT is set, such as when the -R option is used with pkgadd(1M) or
pkgrm(1M), there is no need to use the removef -R option. Note -
The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced with the -R option. Doing so might damage the
global zone's file system, might compromise the security of the global zone, and might damage the non-global
zone's file system. See zones(5).
-V fs_file
Specify an alternative fs_file to map the client's file systems. For example, used in situations where the
$root_path/etc/vfstab file is non-existent or unreliable.
The following operands are supported:
path
The pathname to be removed.
pkginst
The package instance from which the pathname is being removed.
Example 1 Using removef
The following example uses the removef command in an optional pre-install script:
 echo "The following files are no longer part of this package
  and are being removed."
 removef $PKGINST /myapp/file1 /myapp/file2 |
 while read pathname
 do
  echo "$pathname"
  rm -f $pathname
 done
 removef -f $PKGINST || exit 2
<beginning of page>
removef inherits the value of the following environment variable. This variable is set when pkgadd(1M) or
pkgrm(1M) is invoked with the -R option.
PKG_INSTALL_ROOT
If present, defines the full path name of a directory to use as the system's PKG_INSTALL_ROOT path. All product
and package information files are then looked for in the directory tree, starting with the specified PKG_IN<hy>
STALL_ROOT path. If not present, the default system path of / is used.
0
Successful completion.
>0
An error occurred.

Package commands are largefile(5)-aware. They handle files larger than 2 GB in the same way they handle smaller
files. In their current implementations, pkgadd(1M), pkgtrans(1) and other package commands can process a datas<hy>
tream of up to 4 GB.
