krb5kdc <-> KDC daemon
/usr/lib/krb5/krb5kdc [-d dbpath] [-r realm] [-m]
 [-k masterenctype] [-M masterkeyname]
 [-p port] [-n] [-x db_args]...
krb5kdc is the daemon that runs on the master and slave KDCs to process the Kerberos tickets. For Kerberos to
function properly, krb5kdc must be running on at least one KDC that the Kerberos clients can access. Prior to run<hy>
ning krb5kdc, you must initialize the Kerberos database using kdb5_util(1M). See the for information regarding
how to set up KDCs and initialize the Kerberos database.
The following options are supported:
-d dbpath
Specify the path to the database; default value is /var/krb5.
-k masterenctype
Specify the encryption type for encrypting the database. The default value is des-cbc-crc. des3-cbc-sha1, arcfour-
hmac-md5, arcfour-hmac-md5-exp, aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96, and aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 are also valid.
-m
Specify that the master key for the database is to be entered manually.
-M masterkeyname
Specify the principal to retrieve the master Key for the database.
-n
Specify that krb5kdc should not detach from the terminal.
-p port
Specify the port that will be used by the KDC to listen for incoming requests.
-r realm
Specify the realm name; default is the local realm name.
-x db_args
Pass database-specific arguments to kadmin. Supported arguments are for the LDAP plug-in. These arguments are:
binddn=binddn
Specifies the DN of the object used by the KDC server to bind to the LDAP server. This object should have the
rights to read the realm container, principal container and the subtree that is referenced by the realm. Overrides the
ldap_kdc_dn parameter setting in krb5.conf(4).
bindpwd=bindpwd
Specifies the password for the above-mentioned binddn. It is recommended not to use this option. Instead, the pass<hy>
word can be stashed using the stashsrvpw command of kdb5_ldap_util(1M).
nconns=num
Specifies the number of connections to be maintained per LDAP server.
<beginning of page>
host=ldapuri
Specifies, by an LDAP URI, the LDAP server to which to connect.
/var/krb5/principal.db
Kerberos principal database.
/var/krb5/principal.kadm5
Kerberos administrative database. This file contains policy information.
/var/krb5/principal.kadm5.lock
Kerberos administrative database lock file. This file works backwards from most other lock files (that is, kadmin
will exit with an error if this file does not exist).
/etc/krb5/kdc.conf
KDC configuration file. This file is read at startup.
/etc/krb5/kpropd.acl
File that defines the access control list for propagating the Kerberos database using kprop.

SIGHUP
krb5kdc closes and re-opens log files that it directly opens. This can be useful for external log-rotation utilities such
as logadm(1M). If this method is used for log file rotation, set the krb5.conf(4) kdc_rotate period relation to never.
