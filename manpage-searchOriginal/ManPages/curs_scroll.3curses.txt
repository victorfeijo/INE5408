With the scroll() routine, the window is scrolled up one line. This involves moving the lines in the window data
structure. As an optimization, if the scrolling region of the window is the entire screen, the physical screen is
scrolled at the same time.
With the scrl() and wscrl() routines, for positive n scroll the window up n lines (line i+n becomes i); otherwise
scroll the window down n lines. This involves moving the lines in the window character image structure. The current
cursor position is not changed.
For these functions to work, scrolling must be enabled via scrollok().
All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.
