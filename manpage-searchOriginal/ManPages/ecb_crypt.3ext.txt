ecb_crypt() and cbc_crypt() implement the NBS DES (Data Encryption Standard). These routines are faster and
more general purpose than crypt(3C). They also are able to utilize DES hardware if it is available. ecb_crypt() en<hy>
crypts in ECB (Electronic Code Book) mode, which encrypts blocks of data independently. cbc_crypt() encrypts in
CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode, which chains together successive blocks. CBC mode protects against inser<hy>
tions, deletions, and substitutions of blocks. Also, regularities in the clear text will not appear in the cipher text.
The first parameter, key, is the 8-byte encryption key with parity. To set the key's parity, which for DES is in the low
bit of each byte, use des_setparity(). The second parameter, data, contains the data to be encrypted or decrypted.
The third parameter, datalen, is the length in bytes of data, which must be a multiple of 8. The fourth parameter,
mode, is formed by OR'ing together the DES_ENCRYPT or DES_DECRYPT to specify the encryption direction
and DES_HW or DES_SW to specify software or hardware encryption. If DES_HW is specified, and there is no
hardware, then the encryption is performed in software and the routine returns DESERR_NOHWDEVICE.
For cbc_crypt(), the parameter ivec is the 8-byte initialization vector for the chaining. It is updated to the next ini<hy>
tialization vector upon successful return.
Given a result status stat, the macro DES_FAILED is false only for the first two statuses.
DESERR_NONE No error.
DESERR_NOHWDEVICE Encryption succeeded, but done in software instead of the requested hardware.
DESERR_HWERROR An error occurred in the hardware or driver.
DESERR_BADPARAM Bad parameter to routine.

When compiling multi-thread applications, the _REENTRANT flag must be defined on the compile line. This flag
should only be used in multi-thread applications.
