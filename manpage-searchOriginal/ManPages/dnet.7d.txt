dnet <-> Ethernet driver for DEC 21040, 21041, 21140 Ethernet cards
/kernel/drv/dnet
The dnet Ethernet driver is a multithreaded, loadable, clonable, STREAMS GLD driver. Multiple controllers in<hy>
stalled within the system are supported by the driver. The dnet driver functions include controller initialization,
frame transmit and receive, functional addresses, promiscuous and multicast support, and error recovery and report<hy>
ing.
The cloning character-special device, /dev/dnet, is used to access all DEC 21040/21041/21140 devices installed in
the system.
The dnet driver is dependent on /kernel/misc/gld, a loadable kernel module that provides the dnet driver with the
DLPI and STREAMS functionality required of a LAN driver. See gld(7D) for more details on the primitives sup<hy>
ported by the driver.
The device is initialized on the first attach and de-initialized (stopped) on the last detach.
The values returned by the driver in the DL_INFO_ACK primitive in response to a DL_INFO_REQ from the user
are as follows: <bu> The maximum SDU is 1500 (ETHERMTU - defined in <sys/ethernet.h>). <bu> The minimum SDU
is 0. <bu> The DLSAP address length is 8. <bu> The MAC type is DL_ETHER. <bu> The sap length value is <mi>2, meaning
the physical address component is followed immediately by a 2-byte sap component within the DLSAP address. <bu>
The broadcast address value is the Ethernet/IEEE broadcast address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF).
Once in the DL_ATTACHED state, the user must send a DL_BIND_REQ to associate a particular Service Access
Point (SAP) with the stream.
The PCI configuration process varies from system to system. Follow the instructions provided by the vendor. <bu> On
multiport cards (exception: Osicom (Rockwell) RNS2340), the first port is the top port. (On the Osicom RNS2340,
the first port is the bottom port.) <bu> If the dnet driver fails to determine the correct speed and duplex mode resulting
in a corresponding drop in performance, set the speed and duplex mode using the dnet.conf file. <bu> The dnet driver
incorrectly counts carrier lost or no carrier errors while in full-duplex mode. There is no carrier signal present when
in full-duplex mode and it should not be counted as an error. <bu> Version 4 SROM formats are not supported.
The /kernel/drv/dnet.conf file supports the following options:
full-duplex For full duplex operation use full-duplex=1, for half duplex use full-duplex=0. Half-duplex operation
gives better results on older 10mbit networks.
speed For 10mbit operation use speed=10, for 100mbit operation use speed=100. Certain 21140 based cards will
operate at either speed. Use the speed property to override the 100mbit default in this case.
