rctladm <-> display or modify global state of system resource controls
rctladm [-lu] [-e action] [-d action] [name...]
The rctladm command allows the examination and modification of active resource controls on the running system.
An instance of a resource control is referred to as an rctl. See setrctl(2) for a description of an rctl; see re<hy>
source_controls(5) for a list of the rctls supported in the current release of the Solaris operating system. Logging of
rctl violations can be activated or deactivated system-wide and active rctls (and their state) can be listed.
An rctladm command without options is the equivalent of an rctladm with the -l option. See the description of -l
below.
The following options are supported:
-d action
-e action
Disable (-d) or enable (-e) the global action on the specified rctls. If no rctl is specified, no action is taken and an er<hy>
ror status is returned. You can use the special token all with the disable option to deactivate all global actions on a
resource control.
You can set the syslog action to a specific degree by assigning a severity level. To do this, specify syslog=level,
where level is one of the string tokens given as valid severity levels in syslog(3C). You can omit the common LOG_
prefix on the severity level. Note that not all rctls support the syslog action. See resource_controls(5).
-l
List information about rctls. The name, global event actions and statuses, and global flags are displayed. If one or
more name operands are specified, only those rctls matching the names are displayed.
-u
Configure resource controls based on the contents of /etc/rctladm.conf. Any name operands are ignored.
The following operands are supported:
name
The name of the rctl to operate on. Multiple rctl names can be specified. If no names are specified, and the list ac<hy>
tion has been specified, then all rctls are listed. If the enable or disable action is specified, one or more rctl names
must be specified.
Example 1 Activating System Logging for Specific Violations
The following command activates system logging of all violations of task.max-lwps.
 # rctladm -e syslog task.max-lwps
 #
Example 2 Examining the Current Status of a Specific Resource
The following command examines the current status of the task.max-lwps resource.
 $ rctladm -l task.max-lwps
 task.max-lwps syslog=DEBUG
 $
The following exit values are returned:
<beginning of page>
0
Successful completion.
1
A fatal error occurred. A message is written to standard error to indicate each resource control for which the opera<hy>
tion failed. The operation was successful for any other resource controls specified as operands.
2
Invalid command line options were specified.
/etc/rctladm.conf
Each time rctladm is executed, it updates the contents of rctladm.conf with the current configuration.
