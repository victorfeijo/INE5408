uname <-> print name of current system
uname [-aimnprsvX]
uname [-S system_name]
The uname utility prints information about the current system on the standard output. When options are specified,
symbols representing one or more system characteristics will be written to the standard output. If no options are
specified, uname prints the current operating system's name. The options print selected information returned by un<hy>
ame(2), sysinfo(2), or both.
The following options are supported:
-a Prints basic information currently available from the system.
-i Prints the name of the platform.
-m Prints the machine hardware name (class). Use of this option is discouraged. Use uname -p instead. See NOTES
section below.
-n Prints the nodename (the nodename is the name by which the system is known to a communications network).
-p Prints the current host's ISA or processor type.
-r Prints the operating system release level.
-s Prints the name of the operating system. This is the default.
-S system_name The nodename may be changed by specifying a system name argument. The system name argument
is restricted to SYS_NMLN characters. SYS_NMLN is an implementation specific value defined in <sys/ut<hy>
sname.h>. Only the super-user is allowed this capability. This change does not persist across reboots of the system.
Use sys-unconfig(1M) to change a host's name permanently.
-v Prints the operating system version.
-X Prints expanded system information, one information element per line, as expected by SCO UNIX. The displayed
information includes: <bu> system name, node, release, version, machine, and number of CPUs. <bu> BusType, Serial, and
Users (set to "unknown" in Solaris) <bu> OEM# and Origin# (set to 0 and 1, respectively)
Example 1 Printing the OS name and release level
The following command:
 example% uname <mi>sr
prints the operating system name and release level, separated by one SPACE character.
See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of uname: LANG,
LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.
SYSV3 This variable is used to override the default behavior of uname. This is necessary to make it possible for
some INTERACTIVE UNIX Systems and SCO UNIX programs and scripts to work properly. Many scripts use un<hy>
ame to determine the SYSV3 type or the version of the OS to ensure software is compatible with that OS. Setting
<beginning of page>
SYSV3 to an empty string will make uname print the following default values:
 nodename nodename 3.2 2 i386
The individual elements that uname displays can also be modified by setting SYSV3 in the following format:
 os,sysname,node,rel,ver,mach
os Operating system (IUS or SCO).
sysname System name.
node Nodename as displayed by the -n option.
rel Release level as displayed by the -r option.
ver Version number as displayed by the -v option.
mach Machine name as displayed by -m option.
Do not put spaces between the elements. If an element is omitted, the current system value will be used.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred.

Independent software vendors (ISVs) and others who need to determine detailed characteristics of the platform on
which their software is either being installed or executed should use the uname command.
To determine the operating system name and release level, use uname -sr. To determine only the operating system
release level, use uname -r. Notice that operating system release levels are not guaranteed to be in x.y format (such
as 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, and so forth); future releases could be in the x.y.z format (such as 5.3.1, 5.3.2, 5.4.1, and so forth).
In SunOS 4.x releases, the arch(1) command was often used to obtain information similar to that obtained by using
the uname command. The arch(1) command output "sun4" was often incorrectly interpreted to signify a SunOS
SPARC system. If hardware platform information is desired, use uname -sp.
The arch -k and uname -m commands return equivalent values; however, the use of either of these commands by
third party programs is discouraged, as is the use of the arch command in general. To determine the machine's In<hy>
struction Set Architecture (ISA or processor type), use uname with the -p option.
