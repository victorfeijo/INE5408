hook_nic_event <-> data structure describing events related to network interfaces

Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
The hook_nic_event structure contains fields that relate to an event that has occurred and belongs to a network inter<hy>
face. This structure is passed through to callbacks for NE_PLUMB, NE_UNPLUMB, NE_UP, NE_DOWN and
NE_ADDRESS_CHANGE events.
A callback may not alter any of the fields in this structure.
 net_data_t hne_family;
 phy_if_t pkt_private;
 lif_if_t hne_lif;
 nic_event_t hne_event;
 nic_event_data_t hne_data;
 size_t hne_datalen;
The following fields are set for each event:
hne_family A valid reference for the network protocol that owns this network interface and can be in calls to other
netinfo(9F) functions.
hne_nic The physical interface to which an event belongs.
hne_event A value that indicates the respective event. The current list of available events is:
NE_PLUMB an interface has just been created.
NE_UNPLUMB an interface has just been destroyed and no more events should be received for it.
NE_UP an interface has changed the state to "up" and may now generate packet events.
NE_DOWN an interface has changed the state to "down" and will no longer generate packet events.
NE_ADDRESS_CHANGE an address on an interface has changed. hne_lif refers to the logical interface for which
the change is occurring, hne_data is a pointer to a sockaddr structure that is hne_datalen bytes long and contains
the new network address.
