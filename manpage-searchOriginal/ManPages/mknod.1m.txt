mknod <-> make a special file
mknod name b major minor
mknod name c major minor
mknod name p
mknod makes a directory entry for a special file.
The following options are supported:
b Create a block-type special file.
c Create a character-type special file.
p Create a FIFO (named pipe).
The following operands are supported:
major The major device number.
minor The minor device number; can be either decimal or octal. The assignment of major device numbers is specific
to each system. You must be the super-user to use this form of the command.
name A special file to be created.
See largefile(5) for the description of the behavior of mknod when encountering files greater than or equal to 2
Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes).
See attributes(5) for descriptions of the following attributes:

ftp(1), in.ftpd(1M), mknod(2), symlink(2), attributes(5), largefile(5)
If mknod(2) is used to create a device, the major and minor device numbers are always interpreted by the kernel
running on that machine.
With the advent of physical device naming, it would be preferable to create a symbolic link to the physical name of
the device (in the /devices subtree) rather than using mknod.
