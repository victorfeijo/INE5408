idsconfig <-> prepare an iPlanet Directory Server (iDS) to be populated with data and serve LDAP clients
 /usr/lib/ldap/idsconfig [-v] [-i input_configfile]
 [-o output_configfile]
Use the idsconfig tool to set up an iPlanet Directory Server (iDS). You can specify the input configuration file with
the -i option on the command line. Alternatively, the tool will prompt the user for configuration information. The in<hy>
put configuration file is created by idsconfig with the -o option on a previous run.
The first time a server is set up, the user is prompted for all the required information. Future installations on that
machine can use the configuration file previously generated by idsconfig using the -o option.
The output configuration file contains the directory administrator's password in clear text. Thus, if you are creating
an output configuration file, take appropriate security precautions.
You should back up the directory server's configuration and data prior to running this command.
The following options are supported:
-i input_configfile Specify the file name for idsconfig to use as a configuration file. This file will be read by idscon<hy>
fig, and the values in the file will be used to configure the server. Do not manually edit input_configfile. The in<hy>
put_configfile is only partially validated, as idsconfig assumes that the file was created by a previous invocation of
the command.
-o output_configfile Create a configuration file.
-v Verbose output.
The following operands are supported:
input_configfile Name of configuration file for idsconfig to use.
output_configfile Configuration file created by idsconfig.
Example 1 Prompting the User for Input
In the following example, the user is prompted for information to set up iDS.
 example# idsconfig
Example 2 Creating an Output Configuration File
In the following example, the user is prompted for information to set up iDS, and an output configuration file, con<hy>
fig.1, is created when completed.
 example# idsconfig -o config.1
Example 3 Setting up iDS Using the Specified Configuration File
In the following example, iDS is set up by using the values specified in the configuration file, config.1. The verbose
mode is specified, so detailed information will print to the screen.
 example# idsconfig -v -i config.1
The following exit values are returned:
