stty <-> set the options for a terminal
/usr/ucb/stty [-a] [-g] [-h] [modes]
stty sets certain terminal I/O options for the device that is the current standard output. Without arguments, stty re<hy>
ports the settings of certain options.
In this report, if a character is preceded by a caret (^), then the value of that option is the corresponding CTRL char<hy>
acter (for example, ^h is CTRL-h. In this case, recall that CTRL-h is the same as the BACKSPACE key.) The se<hy>
quence ^@ means that an option has a null value.
-a Reports all of the option settings.
-g Reports current settings in a form that can be used as an argument to another stty command.
-h Reports all the option settings with the control characters in an easy to read column format.
Options in the last group are implemented using options in the previous groups. Many combinations of options make
no sense, but no sanity checking is performed. Hardware flow control and clock modes options might not be sup<hy>
ported by all hardware interfaces. The options are selected from the following:
all Reports the same option settings as stty without arguments, but with the control characters in column format.
everything Everything stty knows about is printed. Same as -h option.
speed The terminal speed alone is reported on the standard output.
size The terminal (window) sizes are printed on the standard output, first rows and then columns. This option is only
appropriate if currently running a window system.
size and speed always report on the settings of /dev/tty, and always report the settings to the standard output.

Solaris does not support any of the actions implied by swtch, which was used by the sxt driver on System V release
4. Solaris allows the swtch value to be set, and prints it out if set, but it does not perform the swtch action.
The job switch functionality on Solaris is actually handled by job control. susp is the correct setting for this.
