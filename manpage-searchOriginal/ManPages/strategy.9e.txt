int prefixstrategy(struct buf *bp);
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI). This entry point is required for block devices.
bp Pointer to the buf(9S) structure.
The strategy() routine is called indirectly (through cb_ops(9S)) by the kernel to read and write blocks of data on the
block device. strategy() may also be called directly or indirectly to support the raw character interface of a block de<hy>
vice (read(9E), write(9E) and ioctl(9E)). The strategy() routine's responsibility is to set up and initiate the transfer.
In general, strategy() should not block. It can, however, perform a kmem_cache_create(9F) with both the
KM_PUSHPAGE and KM_SLEEP flags set, which might block, without causing deadlock in low memory situa<hy>
tions.
The strategy() function must return 0. On an error condition, it should call bioerror(9F) to set b_flags to the proper
error code, and call biodone(9F). Note that a partial transfer is not considered to be an error.
