ipc.h, ipc <-> XSI interprocess communication access structure
#include <sys/ipc.h>
The <sys/ipc.h> header is used by three mechanisms for interprocess communication (IPC): messages, semaphores,
and shared memory. All use a common structure type, ipc_perm, to pass information used in determining permis<hy>
sion to perform an IPC operation.
The ipc_perm structure contains the following members:
 uid_t uid /* owner's user ID */
 gid_t gid /* owner's group ID */
 uid_t cuid /* creator's user ID */
 gid_t cgid /* creator's group ID */
 mode_t mode /* read/write permission
The uid_t, gid_t, mode_t, and key_t types are defined as described in <sys/types.h>. See types.h(3HEAD).
Definitions are provided for the constants listed below.
Mode bits:
IPC_CREAT Create entry if key does not exist.
IPC_EXCL Fail if key exists.
IPC_NOWAIT Error if request must wait.
Keys:
IPC_PRIVATE Private key.
Control commands:
IPC_RMID Remove identifier.
IPC_SET Set options.
IPC_STAT Get options.
