The /usr/sbin/sndradm command is the administrative command line interface for the Sun StorageTek Availability
Suite Remote Mirror software. Remote Mirror enables you to replicate disks between different physically-separate
Sun servers in real time. Remote Mirror is conceptually similar to the local disk mirroring scheme of RAID 1 but it
performs its replication operations over longer distances.
If you do not specify a Remote Mirror set (sndr_set) on the command line, sndradm operates on all configured Re<hy>
mote Mirror sets.
The sndradm command generates an entry in the Availability Suite log file, /var/adm/ds.log (see ds.log(4)), for all
operations except print (-p, -P and -i), help (-h), and version (-v).
The sndradm utility supports the following options:
-f volset-file
Specifies a file containing the sndr_set information for one or more Remote Mirror sets in the same format as the
fully specified command line sndr_set documented below.
-g io_groupname
Limits operations to only those Remote Mirror sets belonging to io_groupname.
The io_groupname for a given set must be consistent across both the primary and the secondary hosts.
-C tag
On a clustered node, limits operations to only those Remote Mirror sets belonging to the cluster resource group or
disk group name specified by tag. This option is not valid on a system that is not clustered.
-n
Does not prompt the user after starting a Remote Mirror operation using sndradm. For all but the printing, help, and
version options, the default behavior is to prompt for a response. For example, after starting a full synchronization
from the primary to the secondary volume, Remote Mirror prompts: "Overwrite secondary with primary? (Y/N)
[N]".
sndr_set
Specifies the Remote Mirror set. For a set that has already been enabled, this can be a set_name in the format
shost:sdev. You can supply a fully specified Remote Mirror set in the same format as a configuration file:
 phost pdev pbitmap shost sdev sbitmap ip {sync | async} \
 [g io_groupname] [C tag]
These parameters are described as follows:
phost
Specifies the server on which the primary volume resides.
pdev
Specifies the primary volume partition to be replicated. Specify full pathnames only (for example, /dev/rd<hy>
sk/c0t1d0s2).
<beginning of page>
pbitmap
Specifies the volume partition on which the bitmap (scoreboard log) of the primary partition is stored. Specify full
pathnames only (for example, /dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s3).
shost
Specifies the server on which the secondary volume resides.
sdev
Specifies the secondary volume partition. Specify full path names only (for example, /dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s4).
sbitmap
Specifies the volume partition on which the bitmap (scoreboard log) of the secondary partition is stored. Specify full
path names only (for example, /dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s5).
ip
Specifies the network transfer protocol.
sync | async
Specifies the Remote Mirror operating mode. sync is the Remote Mirror mode where the I/O operation is not con<hy>
firmed as complete until the remote volume has been updated. async is the Remote Mirror mode where the primary
host I/O operation is confirmed as complete before updating the remote volume.
io_groupname
Specifies the name of the Remote Mirror consistency group to which the Remote Mirror set belongs. In asynchro<hy>
nous mode, write ordering must be preserved across all replicating volumes in a Remote Mirror consistency group.
This ensures that the secondary volumes belonging to the group contains a valid point-in-time copy of the corre<hy>
sponding primary volumes.
When adding an existing set to a consistency group or when enabling a set to be in a group, the set must be config<hy>
ured with the same group name on both the primary and the secondary hosts.
tag
For operation within a cluster, this specifies the disk group name or resource tag of the local data and bitmap vol<hy>
umes in cases where this is not implied by the name of the volume (for example, /dev/rdsk/md/dg/vol and
/dev/vx/rdsk/dg/vol both indicate a disk group name of dg). It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the
cluster tag specified to the Remote Mirror matches the appropriate cluster resource group tag, and to keep all the
Availability Suite services up to date in the event of cluster resource group reconfigurations. It is illegal to specify
the cluster resource tag on a system that is not clustered.
A valid sndradm command must specify one of the parameters listed below.
-I a master shadow bitmap
Add an ndr_ii entry with the specified master, shadow, and bitmap to the Availability Suite configuration file. See
sndrsyncd(1M). If the corresponding Point-in-Time Copy set does not exist, it is enabled when the next sync com<hy>
mand is issued on the related volume(s). When no longer required, this Point-in-Time Copy set can be disabled by
iiadm -d. See iiadm(1M)
-I d master shadow bitmap
Delete the ndr_ii entry with the specified master, shadow, and bitmap from the Availability Suite configuration file.
Use the dscfg command to list ndr_ii configuration entries.
<beginning of page>
-a value
Specifies the value, on or off, of the automatic sync variable for the set. Once autosync has been requested for a set,
the functionality is active from the time a sync operation is requested until the set is manually put into logging mode.
Once the set is manually put into logging mode, the autosync functionality is not active and remains inactive until
the next time a sync request is made. To check whether autosync is active, use sndradm -P. To check whether au<hy>
tosync has been requested for a set, look for the"auto=on;" tag for the set in the output of dscfg -l. See
sndrsyncd(1M).
-A value
Specifies the maximum number of threads that can be created to process the asynchronous queue when a set is repli<hy>
cating in asynchronous mode. The default is 2.
-W value
Specifies the maximum number of writes that can be queued to a set replicating in asynchronous mode. The default
is 4096. For example, set this value to 1 to ensure that the secondary volume is never more than one write operation
behind the primary volume.
Tuning the maximum number of writes is only valid for sets using memory-based async I/O queues. This value is ig<hy>
nored when disk based I/O queues are used.
-D {block | noblock}
Toggles the block|noblock attribute of a disk-based queue. The default setting is block. If the I/O fill rate is larger
than the drain rate for enough time for the queue to fill, incoming I/O is blocked until there is adequate space on the
queue for it. This is to preserve write ordering whether it is one volume or across many volumes in the same consis<hy>
tency group. If noblock is set, and incoming I/O fills the queue, the I/O is not blocked. Instead, the set is put into
logging and the disk queue contents are disregarded. An ensuing update sync synchronizes the latest data to the sec<hy>
ondary site.
-F value
Specifies the maximum number of 512-byte FBAs that can be queued in kernel memory to a set replicating in asyn<hy>
chronous mode. The default is 16384.
Tuning the maximum number of FBAs is valid only for sets using memory-based async I/O queues. This value isig<hy>
nored when disk-based I/O queues are used.
-h
Prints the sndradm usage summary.
-v
Prints the Remote Mirror version number.
-e
Enables Remote Mirror for the set and enables scoreboard logging. The scoreboard is set to indicate that a full syn<hy>
chronization is required. Details of the set are saved in the current configuration. See dscfg(1M). The local volume
and the bitmap volume are enabled for the Storage Volume driver (see sv(7D)).
-E
Enables Remote Mirror for the set and enables scoreboard logging. The scoreboard is cleared to indicate that the pri<hy>
mary and secondary volumes are already guaranteed to be fully synchronized. Details of the set are saved in the cur<hy>
rent configuration. See dscfg(1M). The local volume and the bitmap volume are enabled for the Storage Volume
driver (see sv(7D)).
<beginning of page>
-d
Disables Remote Mirror for the set and halts any current synchronization operations. sndradm -d also discards any
active scoreboards that track temporary differences between primary and secondary volumes.
-l
Stops Remote Mirror replication and copy operations between primary and secondary volumes and starts indepen<hy>
dent Remote Mirror scoreboard logging on these volumes. When all the sets in a consistency group are replicating, it
means that the secondary volumes contain a valid point-in-time copy of the corresponding primary volumes. Under
this condition, as soon as one Remote Mirror set drops into logging mode, the rdc kernel module drops all the other
sets in the group into logging mode automatically. This ensures that the secondary volumes still contains a valid
point-in-time copy. To resume the Remote Mirror after using the -l parameter, use the -m parameter to perform a full
resynchronization or the -u parameter to perform an update resynchronization (based on the scoreboard).
This option does not work on the secondary for any volumes that are currently synchronizing.
-w
Waits for a synchronization copy to complete or abort, or returns immediately if invoked on the secondary system.
-H
Reports on the health of the network link used by the specified volume set. The health of the link is reported as ac<hy>
tive or inactive. Active means that the network link is actively being used for replicating or resynchronizing data,
and is therefore in good health. Inactive means that the network link is not actively being used for replicating or
resynchronizing data, which might indicate a problem with the link.
-p
Displays a list of configured Remote Mirror volumes or sets.
-P
Displays a list of configured Remote Mirror volumes or sets with extra details. (See state descriptions, below.)
-q a volume
Add a disk queue to a set or group. This operation is valid when the set or group is in logging mode.
-q d
Remove a disk queue from a set or group. This operation is valid when the set or group is in logging mode.
-q r volume
Replace a disk queue for a group or set. The queue is removed from the set or group as in the queue-disable opera<hy>
tion and the new disk queue is added as in the queue-add operation. This operation is valid when the set or group is
in logging mode.
-i
Displays a list of configured Remote Mirror volumes or sets in the same format as the volset-file.
-R
Attempt to reset a Remote Mirror set's error condition such as failed bitmaps.
<beginning of page>
-R b p bitmap
Reconfigure a Remote Mirror set's primary bitmap. This command should be entered on both primary and secondary
servers. It is only possible to reconfigure the primary bitmap for one set at a time.
-R b s bitmap
Reconfigure a Remote Mirror set's secondary bitmap. This command should be entered on both primary and sec<hy>
ondary servers. It is only possible to reconfigure the secondary bitmap for one set at a time.
-R C tag
Reconfigure the cluster tag, or disk group name, of a Remote Mirror set's local volumes, in those cases where this is
not indicated by the pathname. This does not affect the remote volumes. This parameter cannot be used on a system
that is not clustered.
-R m {sync | async}
Reconfigure the replication mode of a Remote Mirror set. The sets belonging to a consistency group must be either
all synchronous or all asynchronous. It is not possible to mix modes within a group.
-R g group
Reconfigure the consistency group of a Remote Mirror set. This command should be entered with the same group
name on both primary and secondary servers.
To remove a set from a consistency group, specify the null string (" ") when reconfiguring the consistency group.
The following parameters can be issued only from the primary server:
-m
Starts a full volume copy from the primary volume to the secondary volume, and concurrently enables Remote Mir<hy>
ror replication of new updates from the primary volume to the secondary volume. Use this parameter when the pri<hy>
mary and secondary volumes might be different and no logging information exists to incrementally resynchronize
the volumes. See EXIT STATUS.
-r
Reverses the direction of the synchronization so the primary volume is synchronized from the secondary volume.
Use this parameter with the -m or -u parameter. -m -r starts a full volume copy from the secondary (source) volume
to the primary (target) volume but concurrently enables Remote Mirror replication of new updates from the primary
(source) volume to the secondary (target) volume, ensuring the volume sets remain synchronized. Use -m -r when
the primary and secondary volume content might differ and the secondary has the desired contents, yet no logging
information exists to incrementally resynchronize the volumes (using -u). -u -r resynchronizes the primary (target)
volume from the secondary (source) volume, using the Remote Mirror scoreboard logs maintained while replication
was suspended. It then resumes Remote Mirror replication of new updates from the primary volume to the secondary
volume so that the volume sets remain synchronized. Quiesce the workload to the volume sets during the restore/re<hy>
fresh operation. This action ensures that the primary and secondary volumes match before replication of new up<hy>
dates resumes.
-u
Updates a Remote Mirror volume set. This parameter resynchronizes a Remote Mirror volume set. Only the blocks
logged as changed in the Remote Mirror scoreboards are updated. Enables Remote Mirror replication for the prima<hy>
ry volume and also uses the Remote Mirror scoreboard logs to start the resynchronization process so that the corre<hy>
sponding secondary volume matches the primary volume.
The following are the states that can be returned from sndradm -P.
<beginning of page>
volume failed
An I/O operation to the local data volume has failed
bitmap failed
An I/O operation to the local bitmap volume has failed
disk queue failed
An I/O operation to disk queue volume has failed
need sync
A sync to this volume has been interrupted. It needs to be completed (or restored via Point-in-Time Copy). The di<hy>
rection of the data flow must not be changed until one or the other is done.
need reverse sync
A reverse sync to this volume has been interrupted. It needs to be completed (or restored via Point-in-Time Copy).
The direction of the data flow must not be changed until one or the other is done.
logging
Incoming writes are logged in the bitmap only. Data is not replicated to the remote site. need sync, need reverse
sync, and queuing are all substates of logging such that writes are logged in the bitmap, but not replicated. Queuing
mode (described below) logs the writes to the bitmap, and queues the request for later replication by the async flush<hy>
ers.
reverse syncing
A secondary to primary copy is in progress.
syncing
A primary to secondary copy is in progress.
queuing
During normal async replication using disk queues, i/o is placed on the disk queue to be replicated by the async
flusher threads. In the event of a temporary link failure, the set transitions to queuing mode. The queue is not dis<hy>
carded, as it would be with memory based queues. Instead, data is logged in the bitmap and placed on the queue.
When the link comes up, and sndradm -u is issued, (automated by turning autosync on for the set) the flushers
restarts. This preserves write ordering through a temporary link outage. If write ordering is not necessary, and only
the latest data is needed, the set can be put into logging manually (sndradm -l) and an update sync issued (sndradm
-u). This action discards the data on the queue, and fast resyncs using the bitmap. If the queue fills before the link
comes back and the update sync is issued, the queue is discarded and the set put into logging mode to avoid applica<hy>
tion hangs.
Example 1 Enabling a Remote Mirror Set
The following command enables a Remote Mirror asynchronous set on host example, where example is the primary
host and example-remote is the secondary host.
 example% sndradm -e example /dev/rdsk/c1t0d0s1 /dev/rdsk/c1t1d0s3 \
 example-remote /dev/rdsk/c2t3d0s5 /dev/rdsk/c2t4d0s5 ip async
Example 2 Adding a Disk Queue to an Asynchronous Set
The following command adds a disk queue volume to an asynchronous set.
<beginning of page>
 example% sndradm -q a /dev/rdsk/c1t2d0s3 \
 example-remote:/dev/rdsk/c2t3d0s5
Example 3 Removing a Disk Queue from an Asynchronous Set
The following command removes the disk queue volume from a set with a disk queue volume attatched to it.
 example% sndradm -q d example-remote:/dev/rdsk/c2t3d0s5
Example 4 Disabling a Remote Mirror Set
The following command disables a Remote Mirror set enabled on host example.
 example% sndradm -d example-remote:/dev/rdsk/c2t3d0s5
0 Command completed successfully.
>0 An error occurred.
When the -m or -u option is executed in a script, the exit status following one of these options always returns suc<hy>
cess, regardless of the current status of the Remote Mirror set.
