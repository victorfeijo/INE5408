putdev <-> edits device table
putdev -a alias [attribute=value [...]]
putdev -m device attribute=value [attribute = value [...]]
putdev -d device [attribute [...]]
putdev adds a new device to the device table, modifies an existing device description or removes a device entry from
the table. The first synopsis is used to add a device. The second synopsis is used to modify existing entries by adding
or changing attributes. If a specified attribute is not defined, this option adds that attribute to the device definition. If
a specified attribute is already defined, it modifies the attribute definition. The third synopsis is used to delete either
an entire device entry or, if the attribute argument is used, to delete an attribute assignment for a device.
The following options are supported:
-a Add a device to the device table using the specified attributes. The device must be referenced by its alias.
-d Remove a device from the device table, when executed without the attributes argument. Used with the attribute
argument, it deletes the given attribute specification for device from the table.
-m Modify a device entry in the device table. If an entry already exists, it adds any specified attributes that are not
defined. It also modifies any attributes which already have a value with the value specified by this command.
The following operands are supported:
alias Designates the alias of the device to be added.
attribute Designates a device attribute to be added, modified, or deleted. Can be any of the device attributes de<hy>
scribed under DEVICE ATTRIBUTES except alias. This prevents an accidental modification or deletion of a de<hy>
vice's alias from the table.
device Designates the pathname or alias of the device whose attribute is to be added, modified, or removed.
value Designates the value to be assigned to a device's attribute.
The following list shows the standard device attributes, used by applications such as ufsdump(1M) and ufsre<hy>
store(1M), which can be defined for a device. You are not limited to this list, you can define any attribute you like.
alias The unique name by which a device is known. No two devices in the database may share the same alias name.
The name is limited in length to 14 characters and should contain only alphanumeric characters and the following
special characters if they are escaped with a backslash: underscore ( _ ), dollar sign ($), hyphen (<mi>), and period (.).
bdevice The pathname to the block special device node associated with the device, if any. The associated major/mi<hy>
nor combination should be unique within the database and should match that associated with the cdevice field, if
any. (It is the administrator's responsibility to ensure that these major/minor numbers are unique in the database.)
capacity The capacity of the device or of the typical volume, if removable.
cdevice The pathname to the character special device node associated with the device, if any. The associated ma<hy>
jor/minor combination should be unique within the database and should match that associated with the bdevice field,
if any. (It is the administrator's responsibility to ensure that these major/minor numbers are unique in the database.)
cyl Used by the command specified in the mkfscmd attribute.
<beginning of page>
desc A description of any instance of a volume associated with this device (such as floppy diskette).
dpartlist The list of disk partitions associated with this device. Used only if type=disk. The list should contain de<hy>
vice aliases, each of which must have type=dpart.
dparttype The type of disk partition represented by this device. Used only if type=dpart. It should be either fs (for
file system) or dp (for data partition).
erasecmd The command string that, when executed, erases the device.
fmtcmd The command string that, when executed, formats the device.
fsname The file system name on the file system administered on this partition, as supplied to the /usr/sbin/labelit
command. This attribute is specified only if type=dpart and dparttype=fs.
gap Used by the command specified in the mkfscmd attribute.
mkfscmd The command string that, when executed, places a file system on a previously formatted device.
mountpt The default mount point to use for the device. Used only if the device is mountable. For disk partitions
where type=dpart and dparttype=fs, this attribute should specify the location where the partition is normally
mounted.
nblocks The number of blocks in the file system administered on this partition. Used only if type=dpart and dpart<hy>
type=fs.
ninodes The number of inodes in the file system administered on this partition. Used only if type=dpart and dpart<hy>
type=fs.
norewind The name of the character special device node that allows access to the serial device without rewinding
when the device is closed.
pathname Defines the pathname to an i-node describing the device (used for non-block or character device path<hy>
names, such as directories).
type A token that represents inherent qualities of the device. Standard types include: 9-track, ctape, disk, directory,
diskette, dpart, and qtape.
volname The volume name on the file system administered on this partition, as supplied to the /usr/sbin/labelit
command. Used only if type=dpart and dparttype=fs.
volume A text string used to describe any instance of a volume associated with this device. This attribute should not
be defined for devices which are not removable.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.

1 Command syntax was incorrect, an invalid option was used, or an internal error occurred.
2 The device table could not be opened for reading, or a new device table could not be created.
3 If executed with the -a option, indicates that an entry in the device table with the alias alias already exits. If ex<hy>
ecuted with the -m or -d options, indicates that no entry exists for device device.
4 Indicates that -d was requested and one or more of the specified attributes were not defined for the device.
