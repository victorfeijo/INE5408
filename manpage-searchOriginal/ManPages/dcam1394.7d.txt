dcam1394 <-> 1394-based digital camera (IIDC) driver
#include <sys/dcam/dcam1394_io.h>
The dcam1394 driver supports devices implementing the 1394 Trade Association Digital Camera Specification (also
referred to as the IIDC specification). Only a subset of the specification is supported.
Isochronous data is read from the driver frame-by-frame and is maintained within the driver in a ring buffer.
Video frames are read from the isochronous input device using read(2).
The dcam1394_frame_t structure describes the frame layout and is defined as follows:
  struct {
  unsigned int vid_mode;
  unsigned int seq_num;
  hrtime_t timestamp;
  unsigned char *buff;
  };
The size to allocate for the structure is determined by the video mode for which the camera is configured. Possible
values for the vid_mode field are listed under DCAM1394_PARAM_VID_MODE below.
The following ioctl requests are supported:
DCAM1394_CMD_CAM_RESET
Reset the device.
DCAM1394_CMD_REG_READ
Read the indicated dcam/IIDC register. The argument is a pointer to a dcam1394_reg_io_t structure, which is de<hy>
fined as follows:
  struct {
  unsigned int offs;
  unsigned int val;
  };
The offs field should be set to the offset of the register from which to read. Register offset values are defined in the
1394 Trade Association Digital Camera Specification.
After the operation is completed, the camera register value is put in the val field.
DCAM1394_CMD_REG_WRITE
Write the indicated dcam/IIDC register. The argument is a pointer to a dcam1394_reg_io_t structure (described
above).
The offs field should be set to the offset of the register from which to read. The register offset values are defined in
the 1394 Trade Association Digital Camera Specification.
The val field should be set to the value to be written to the camera register.
DCAM1394_CMD_PARAM_GET
Gets a list of parameters associated with a camera. The argument is a pointer to a dcam1394_param_list_t structure
(described below). The parameter list is accessed through macros defined below.
The paramter list only supports Format 1 video formats.
<beginning of page>
DCAM1394_CMD_PARAM_SET
Sets a list of parameters associated with a camera. The argument is a pointer to a dcam1394_param_list_t struc<hy>
ture (described below). The parameter list is accessed through macros defined below.
The paramter list only supports Format 1 video formats.
DCAM1394_CMD_FRAME_RCV_START
Start receiving video frames from the camera.
The contents of the ring buffer may be accessed by reading the isochronous stream device.
DCAM1394_CMD_FRAME_RCV_STOP
Stop receiving frames from the camera.
DCAM1394_CMD_RING_BUFF_FLUSH
Flush the frames in the ring buffer.
DCAM1394_CMD_FRAME_SEQ_NUM_COUNT_RESET
Reset frame sequence number.
The parameter list is initialized and access through macros. The data type for the parameter list is
dcam1394_param_list_t.
The following macros are used to access the parameter list:
PARAM_LIST_INIT(param_list)
Initialize the parameter list.
PARAM_LIST_ADD(param_list, param, subparam)
Add a parameter to the list.
PARAM_LIST_REMOVE(param_list, param, subparam)
Remove a parameter from the list.
PARAM_LIST_IS_ENTRY(param_list, param, subparam)
Indicates if a specific parameter is in the list.
PARAM_VAL(param_list, param, subparam)
Value of a specified parameter.
PARAM_ERR(param_list, param, subparam)
Indicates if a specific parameter is successfully set.
When no subparam value is required, the value DCAM1394_SUBPARAM_NONE may be used.
The following parameters may appear in the list:
