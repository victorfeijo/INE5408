getdtablesize <-> get the file descriptor table size
#include <unistd.h>
int getdtablesize(void);
The getdtablesize() function is equivalent to getrlimit(2) with the RLIMIT_NOFILE option.
The getdtablesize() function returns the current soft limit as if obtained from a call to getrlimit() with the RLIM<hy>
IT_NOFILE option.
No errors are defined.
There is no direct relationship between the value returned by getdtablesize() and OPEN_MAX defined in <lim<hy>
its.h>.
Each process has a file descriptor table which is guaranteed to have at least 20 slots. The entries in the descriptor ta<hy>
ble are numbered with small integers starting at 0. The getdtablesize() function returns the current maximum size of
this table by calling the getrlimit() function.
