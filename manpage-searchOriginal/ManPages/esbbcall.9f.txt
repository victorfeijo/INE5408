esbbcall <-> call function when buffer is available
#include <sys/stream.h>
bufcall_id_t esbbcall(uint_t pri, void (*func)(void *arg),
 void(arg));
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI).
pri Priority of allocation request (to be used by allocb(9F) function, called by esbbcall()).
func Function to be called when buffer becomes available.
arg Argument to func.
The esbbcall() function, like bufcall(9F), serves as a timeout(9F) call of indeterminate length. If esballoc(9F) is un<hy>
able to allocate a message and data block header to go with its externally supplied data buffer, esbbcall() can be used
to schedule the routine func, to be called with the argument arg when a buffer becomes available. The func argument
can be a routine that calls esballoc(9F) or it may be another kernel function.
On success, a bufcall IDis returned. On failure, 0 is returned. The value returned from a successful call should be
saved for possible future use with unbufcall() should it become necessary to cancel the esbbcall() request (as at
driver close time).
The esbbcall() function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context.
