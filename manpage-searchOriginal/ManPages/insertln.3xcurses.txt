win Is a pointer to the window in which to insert the line.
The insertln() and winsertln() functions insert a blank line before the current line in stdscr or win, respectively.
The new line becomes the current line. The current line and all lines after it in the window are moved down one
line. The bottom line in the window is discarded.
On success, these functions return OK. Otherwise, they return ERR.
None.
