fwflash <-> firmware query and update utility
/usr/sbin/fwflash [-l [-c device_class | ALL ]]
 | [-v] | [-h]
fwflash [-f file1,file2,file3,... | -r file]
 [-y] [-d device_path]
The fwflash command writes a binary image file to supported flashable devices attached to a Solaris host. It also
provides the ability to read firmware to a file if supported by the device. Because changing the firmware in a device
can have significant impact on the stability of a system, only users with the privilege All are allowed to execute this
command. Users authorized to run fwflash can be granted the "Firmware Flash Update" Rights Profile.
The first form of the command, above, provides information about devices. It lists all devices currently available on
the system that are supported by fwflash for firmware upgrade. You can filter the list operation, to display only spec<hy>
ified classes of devices. The second form of the command provides the operations to read or write the firmware im<hy>
ages to specific devices.
The following options are supported:
-c device_class
An optional parameter, valid only when used with the -l option. This option causes the command to list only devices
of a specific class type. Currently supported classes are IB, ses, sesgen, or ALL. If -c is not specified for the -lop<hy>
tion, the class defaults to ALL.
-d dev_path
The dev_path is absolute path name of the device that the user wants to modify with the -for -r operation. If the de<hy>
vice cannot be found, the command fails. If the -d option is specified, then either -f or -r must also be specified.
-f file1,file2,file3,...
Specify the path to one or more binary firmware image files you want to write to the device. fwflash will verify that
each file is a valid firmware image for the specified device. If it is not, the command fails with an appropriate error
message.
If multiple firmware image files are specified, each image is verified and flashed to the device in the order given on
the command line. If any of the specified files cannot be successfully flashed, then an appropriate message is dis<hy>
played.
After a new firmware image is flashed to a device, a reboot is required to correctly activate the new firmware.
-h
Display the command line usage message for fwflash.
-l
List the devices on a system available for firmware upgrade and display information specific to each device or device
class.
For InfiniBand (IB) devices, the list operation displays the guids (Globally Unique Identifier) currently set for the
HCA, as well as the current firmware revision installed. There are four separate guids on the HCA; two of them can
be set with the same value.
For SCSI Enclosure Services (ses or sgen) devices, an identifying target-port worldwide name is displayed, if avail<hy>
able.
-r file
Specify the path to a file to create when reading the firmware from the device. The -f and -r options are mutually ex<hy>
clusive.
<beginning of page>
Not all flashable devices support reading firmware images back from the device. At present, only InfiniBand (IB)
devices are supported for this operation. A message will be displayed if the selected device does not support this op<hy>
eration.
-v
Display fwflash version information and exit.
-y
Valid only when a flash read (-r) or write (-f) operation is specified. This option causes fwflash not to prompt for
confirmation during operation and operate non-interactively. Note that there is no option that allows you to forcibly
flash an incompatible firmware image onto a device.
Example 1 Entering Command Without Arguments
The following command shows fwflash when the command is entered without arguments.
 example# fwflash
 Usage:
 Usage:
  fwflash [-l [-c device_class | ALL]] | [-v] | [-h]
  fwflash [-f file1,file2,file3,... | -r file] [-y] -d device_path
  -l list flashable devices in this system
  -c device_class limit search to a specific class
  eg IB for InfiniBand, ses for SCSI Enclosures
  -v print version number of fwflash utility
  -h print this usage message
  -f file1,file2,file3,...
  firmware image file list to flash
  -r file file to dump device firmware to
  -y answer Yes/Y/y to prompts
  -d device_path pathname of device to be flashed
  If -d device_path is specified, then one of -f <files>
  or -r <file> must also be specified
  If multiple firmware images are required to be flashed
  they must be listed together, separated by commas. The
  images will be flashed in the order specified.
Example 2 Listing Devices Available to Flash
The following command lists the devices available to be flashed.
 example# fwflash -l
 List of available devices:

Example 3 Flash Upgrading an IB HCA Device
The following command flash upgrades an IB HCA device.
 example# fwflash -f ./version.3.2.0000 \
  -d /devices/pci@0,0/pci8086,3597@4/pci15b3,6278@0:devctl
 About to update firmware on:
  /devices/pci@0,0/pci8086,3597@4/pci15b3,6278@0:devctl
 Continue (Y/N): Y
 Updating . . . . . . . . . . . .
 Done. New image will be active after the system is rebooted.
Note that you are prompted before the upgrading proceeds and that it is mandatory that you reboot your host to acti<hy>
vate the new firmware image.
The following command adds the -y option to the command.
 example# fwflash -y -f ./version.3.2.0000 \
  -d /devices/pci@0,0/pci8086,3597@4/pci15b3,6278@0:devctl
 About to update firmware on:
  /devices/pci@0,0/pci8086,3597@4/pci15b3,6278@0:devctl
 Updating . . . . . . . . . . . .
 Done. New image will be active after the system is rebooted.
Example 4 Reading Device Firmware to File
The command shown below reads the device firmware to a file. The command uses the -y option so that read occurs
without prompting.
 example# fwflash -y -r /firmware.bin \
  -d /devices/pci@1d,700000/pci@1/pci15b3,5a44@0:devctl
 About to read firmware on:
  /devices/pci@1d,700000/pci@1/pci15b3,5a44@0:devctl
 to filename: /firmware.bin
<beginning of page>
 Reading . . .
 Done.
Example 5 When No Flashable Devices Are Found
The command output shown below informs the user that there are no supported flashable devices found in the sys<hy>
tem:
 example# fwflash -l
 fwflash: No flashable devices attached with the ses driver in this system
 fwflash: No flashable devices attached with the sgen driver in this system
 fwflash: No flashable devices attached with the tavor driver in this system
 fwflash: No flashable devices in this system
Each plugin found in /usr/lib/fwflash/identify is loaded in turn, and walks the system device tree, determining
whether any currently-attached devices can be flashed. For the list of device types and drivers that are currently sup<hy>
ported, please see the NOTES section below.
The fwflash command returns the following values:
0
