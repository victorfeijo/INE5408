lp <-> driver for parallel port
include <sys/bpp_io.h>
fd = open("/dev/lpn", flags);
The lp driver provides the interface to the parallel ports used by printers for x86 based systems. The lp driver is im<hy>
plemented as a STREAMS device.
BPPIOC_TESTIO Test transfer readiness. This command checks to see if a read or write transfer would succeed
based on pin status. If a transfer would succeed, 0 is returned. If a transfer would fail, <mi>1 is returned, and errno is
set to EIO. The error status can be retrieved using the BPPIOC_GETERR ioctl() call.
BPPIOC_GETERR Get last error status. The argument is a pointer to a struct bpp_error_status. See below for a
description of the elements of this structure. This structure indicates the status of all the appropriate status bits at the
time of the most recent error condition during a read(2) or write(2) call, or the status of the bits at the most recent
BPPIOC_TESTIO ioctl(2) call. The application can check transfer readiness without attempting another transfer
using the BPPIOC_TESTIO ioctl().
This structure and symbols are defined in the include file <sys/bpp_io.h>:
 struct bpp_error_status {
   char timeout_occurred; /* Not use */
   char bus_error; /* Not use */
   uchar_t pin_status; /* Status of pins which could cause an error */
 };
 /* Values for pin_status field */
 #define BPP_ERR_ERR 0x01 /* Error pin active */
 #define BPP_SLCT_ERR 0x02 /* Select pin active */
 #define BPP_PE_ERR 0x04 /* Paper empty pin active */
Note: Other pin statuses are defined in <sys/bpp_io.h>, but BPP_ERR_ERR, BPP_SLCT_ERR and
BPP_PE_ERR are the only ones valid for the x86 lp driver.
EIO A BPPIOC_TESTIO ioctl() call is attempted while a condition exists that would prevent a transfer (such as a
peripheral error).
EINVAL An ioctl() is attempted with an invalid value in the command argument.
