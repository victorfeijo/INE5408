fmadm <-> fault management configuration tool
fmadm [-q] [subcommand [arguments]]
The fmadm utility can be used by administrators and service personnel to view and modify system configuration pa<hy>
rameters maintained by the Solaris Fault Manager, fmd(1M). fmd receives telemetry information relating to prob<hy>
lems detected by the system software, diagnoses these problems, and initiates proactive self-healing activities such
as disabling faulty components.
fmadm can be used to: <bu> view the set of diagnosis engines and agents that are currently participating in fault man<hy>
agement, <bu> view the list of system components that have been diagnosed as faulty, and <bu> perform administrative tasks
related to these entities.
The Fault Manager attempts to automate as many activities as possible, so use of fmadm is typically not required.
When the Fault Manager needs help from a human administrator, service repair technician, or Sun, it produces a
message indicating its needs. It also refers you to a knowledge article on Sun's web site, http://www.sun.com/msg/.
The web site might ask you to use fmadm or one of the other fault management utilities to gather more information
or perform additional tasks. The documentation for fmd(1M), fmdump(1M), and fmstat(1M) describe more about
tools to observe fault management activities.
The fmadm utility requires the user to possess the SYS_CONFIG privilege. Refer to the for more information
about how to configure Solaris privileges. The fmadm load subcommand requires that the user possess all privi<hy>
leges.
fmadm accepts the following subcommands. Some of the subcommands accept or require additional options and
operands:
fmadm acquit fmri | label [uuid]
Notify the Fault Manager that the specified resource is not to be considered to be a suspect in the fault event identi<hy>
fied by uuid, or if no UUID is specified, then in any fault or faults that have been detected. The fmadm acquit sub<hy>
command should be used only at the direction of a documented Sun repair procedure. Administrators might need to
apply additional commands to re-enable a previously faulted resource.
fmadm acquit uuid
Notify the Fault Manager that the fault event identified by uuid can be safely ignored. The fmadm acquit subcom<hy>
mand should be used only at the direction of a documented Sun repair procedure. Administrators might need to ap<hy>
ply additional commands to re-enable any previously faulted resources.
fmadm config
Display the configuration of the Fault Manager itself, including the module name, version, and description of each
component module. Fault Manager modules provide services such as automated diagnosis, self-healing, and messag<hy>
ing for hardware and software present on the system.
fmadm faulty [-afgiprsv] [-n max] [-u uid]
Display status information for resources that the Fault Manager currently believes to be faulty.
The following options are supported:
-a Display all faults. By default, the fmadm faulty command only lists output for resources that are currently
present and faulty. If you specify the -a option, all resource information cached by the Fault Manager is listed, in<hy>
cluding faults which have been automatically corrected or where no recovery action is needed. The listing includes
information for resources that might no longer be present in the system.
-f Display faulty fru's (Field replaceable units).
-g Group together faults which have the same fru, class and fault message.
<beginning of page>
-i Display persistent cache identifier for each resource in the Fault Manager.
-n max If faults or resources are grouped together with the -a or -g options, limit the output to max entries.
-p Pipe output through pager with form feed between each fault.
-r Display Fault Management Resource with their Identifier (FMRI) and their fault management state.
-s Display 1 line fault summary for each fault event.
-u uid Only display fault with given uid.
-v Display full output.
The percentage certainty is displayed if a fault has multiple suspects, either of different classes or on different fru's.
If more than one resource is on the same fru and it is not 100% certain that the fault is associated with the fru, the
maximum percentage certainty of the possible suspects on the fru is displayed.
The Fault Manager associates the following states with every resource for which telemetry information has been re<hy>
ceived:
ok
The resource is present and in use and has no known problems so far as the Fault Manager is concerned.
unknown
The resource is not present or not usable but has no known problems. This might indicate the resource has been dis<hy>
abled or deconfigured by an administrator. Consult appropriate management tools for more information.
faulted
The resource is present but is not usable because one or more problems have been diagnosed by the Fault Manager.
The resource has been disabled to prevent further damage to the system.
degraded
The resource is present and usable, but one or more problems have been diagnosed in the resource by the Fault Man<hy>
ager.
If all affected resources are in the same state, this is reflected in the message at the end of the list. Otherwise the state
is given after each affected resource.
fmadm flush fmri
Flush the information cached by the Fault Manager for the specified resource, named by its FMRI. This subcom<hy>
mand should only be used when indicated by a documented Sun repair procedure. Typically, the use of this com<hy>
mand is not necessary as the Fault Manager keeps its cache up-to-date automatically. If a faulty resource is flushed
from the cache, administrators might need to apply additional commands to enable the specified resource.
fmadm load path
Load the specified Fault Manager module. path must be an absolute path and must refer to a module present in one
of the defined directories for modules. Typically, the use of this command is not necessary as the Fault Manager
loads modules automatically when Solaris initially boots or as needed.
<beginning of page>
fmadm unload module
Unload the specified Fault Manager module. Specify module using the basename listed in the fmadm config output.
Typically, the use of this command is not necessary as the Fault Manager loads and unloads modules automatically
based on the system configuration
fmadm repaired fmri | label
Notify the Fault Manager that a repair procedure has been carried out on the specified resource. The fmadm re<hy>
paired subcommand should be used only at the direction of a documented Sun repair procedure. Administrators
might need to apply additional commands to re-enable a previously faulted resource.
fmadm replaced fmri | label
Notify the Fault Manager that the specified resource has been replaced. This command should be used in those cases
where the Fault Manager is unable to automatically detect the replacement. The fmadm replaced subcommand
should be used only at the direction of a documented Sun repair procedure. Administrators might need to apply addi<hy>
tional commands to re-enable a previously faulted resource.
fmadm reset [-s serd] module
Reset the specified Fault Manager module or module subcomponent. If the -s option is present, the specified Soft Er<hy>
ror Rate Discrimination (SERD) engine is reset within the module. If the -s option is not present, the entire module
is reset and all persistent state associated with the module is deleted. The fmadm reset subcommand should only be
used at the direction of a documented Sun repair procedure. The use of this command is typically not necessary as
the Fault Manager manages its modules automatically.
fmadm rotate errlog | fltlog
The rotate subcommand is a helper command for logadm(1M), so that logadm can rotate live log files correctly. It
is not intended to be invoked directly. Use one of the following commands to cause the appropriate logfile to be ro<hy>
tated, if the current one is not zero in size:
 # logadm -p now -s 1b /var/fm/fmd/errlog
 # logadm -p now -s 1b /var/fm/fmd/fltlog
The following options are supported:
-q Set quiet mode. fmadm does not produce messages indicating the result of successful operations to standard out<hy>
put.
The following operands are supported:
cmd The name of a subcommand listed in SUBCOMMANDS.
args One or more options or arguments appropriate for the selected subcommand, as described in SUBCOM<hy>
MANDS.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
1 An error occurred. Errors include a failure to communicate with fmd or insufficient privileges to perform the re<hy>
quested operation.
