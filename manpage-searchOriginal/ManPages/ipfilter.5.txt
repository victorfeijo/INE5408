ipfilter <-> IP packet filtering software
IP Filter is software that provides packet filtering capabilities on a Solaris system. On a properly setup system, it can
be used to build a firewall.
Solaris IP Filter is installed with the Solaris operating system. However, packet filtering is not enabled by default.
See ipf(1M) for a procedure to enable and activate the IP Filter feature.
To simplify IP Filter configuration management, a firewall framework is created to allow users to configure IP Filter
by expressing firewall policy at system and service level. Given the user-defined firewall policy, the framework gen<hy>
erates a set of IP Filter rules to enforce the desired system behavior. Users specify system and service firewall poli<hy>
cies that allow or deny network traffic from certain hosts, subnets, and interface(s). The policies are translated into a
set of active IPF rules to enforce the specified firewall policies. Note -
Users can still specify their own ipf rule file if they choose not to take advantage of the framework. See ipf(1M) and
ipf(4).
This section describes the host-based firewall framework. See svc.ipfd(1M) for details on how to configure firewall
policies.
A three-layer approach with different precedence levels helps the user achieve the desired behaviors.
Global Default
Global Default - Default system-wide firewall policy. This policy is automatically inherited by all services unless
services modify their firewall policy.
Network Services
Higher precedence than Global Default. A service's policy allows/disallows traffic to its specific ports, regardless of
Global Default policy.
Global Override
Another system-wide policy that takes precedence over the needs of specific services in Network Services layer.

 Global Default
A firewall policy includes a firewall mode and an optional set of network sources. Network sources are IP addresses,
subnets, and local network interfaces, from all of which a system can receive incoming traffic. The basic set of fire<hy>
wall modes are:
None
No firewall, allow all incoming traffic.
Deny
Allow all incoming traffic but deny from specified source(s).
Allow
Deny all incoming traffic but allow from specified source(s).
The first system-wide layer, Global Default, defines a firewall policy that applies to any incoming traffic, for exam<hy>
<beginning of page>
ple, allowing or blocking all traffic from an IP address. This makes it simple to have a policy that blocks all incom<hy>
ing traffic or all incoming traffic from unwanted source(s).
The Network Services layer contains firewall policies for local programs that provide service to remote clients, for
example, telnetd, sshd, and httpd. Each of these programs, a network service, has its own firewall policy that con<hy>
trols access to its service. Initially, a service's policy is set to inherit Global Default policy, a "Use Global Default"
mode. This makes it simple to set a single policy, at the Global Default layer, that can be inherited by all services.
When a service's policy is different from Global Default policy, the service's policy has higher precedence. If Global
Default policy is set to block all traffic from a subnet, the SSH service could be configured to allow access from cer<hy>
tain hosts in that subnet. The set of all policies for all network services comprises the Network Service layer.
The second system-wide layer, Global Override, has a firewall policy that also applies to any incoming network traf<hy>
fic. This policy has highest precedence and overrides policies in the other layers, specifically overriding the needs of
network services. The example is when it is desirable to block known malicious source(s) regardless of services'
policies.
This framework leverages IP Filter functionality and is active only when svc:/network/ipfilter is enabled and inac<hy>
tive when network/ipfilter is disabled. Similarly, a network service's firewall policy is only active when that service
is enabled and inactive when the service is disabled. A system with an active firewall has IP Filter rules for each run<hy>
ning/enabled network service and system-wide policy(s) whose firewall mode is not None.
A user configures a firewall by setting the system-wide policies and policy for each network service. See
svc.ipfd(1M) on how to configure a firewall policy.
The firewall framework composes of policy configuration and a mechanism to generate IP Filter rules from the poli<hy>
cy and applying those rules to get the desired IP Filter configuration. A quick summary of the design and user inter<hy>

System Administration Guide: IP Services
The ipfilter service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/network/ipfilter:default
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). The service's status can be queried using the svcs(1) command.
IP Filter startup configuration files are stored in /etc/ipf.
