The metaclear command deletes the specified metadevice or hot_spare_pool, or purges all soft partitions from the
designated component. Once a metadevice or hot spare pool is deleted, it must be re-created using metainit before it
can be used again.
Any metadevice currently in use (open) cannot be deleted.
Root privileges are required for all of the following options except -h.
-a Deletes all metadevices and configured hot spare pools in the set named by -s, or the local set by default.
-f Deletes (forcibly) a metadevice that contains a subcomponent in an error state.
-h Displays usage message.
-p Deletes (purges) all soft partitions from the specified metadevice or component.
-r Recursively deletes specified metadevices and hot spare pools, but does not delete metadevices on which others
depend.
-s setname Specifies the name of the diskset on which metaclear will work. Using the -s option causes the command
to perform its administrative function within the specified diskset. Without this option, the command performs its
function on local metadevices and/or hot spare pools.
metadevice ... Specifies the name(s) of the metadevice(s) to be deleted.
component Specifies the c*d*t*s* name(s) of the components containing soft partitions to be deleted.
hot_spare_pool ... Specifies the name(s) of the hot spare pools to be deleted. Names for hot spare pools can be any
legal file name that is composed of alphanumeric characters, a dash ("-"), an underscore ("_"), or a period (".").
Names must begin with a letter. The words "all" and "none" are reserved and cannot be used.
Example 1 Deleting Various Devices
The following example deletes a metadevice named d10.
 # metaclear /dev/md/dsk/d10
The following example deletes all local metadevices and hot spare pools on the system.
<beginning of page>
 # metaclear -a
The following example deletes a mirror, mymirror, with a submirror in an error state.
 # metaclear -f mymirror
The following example deletes a hot spare pool, hsp001.
 # metaclear hsp001
The following example deletes a soft partition, d23.
 # metaclear d23
The following example purges all soft partitions on the slice c2t3d5s2 if those partitions are not being used by other
metadevices or are not open.
 # metaclear -p c2t3d5s2
The following example purges soft partitions from a metadevice.
 # metaclear -p d2
 d3: Soft Partition is cleared
 d4: Soft Partition is cleared
 d5: Soft Partition is cleared
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred.
