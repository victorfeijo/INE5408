rtquery <-> query routing daemons for their routing tables
rtquery [-np1] [-w timeout] [-r addr] [-a secret] host...
rtquery [-t operation] host...
The rtquery command is used to query a RIP network routing daemon, in.routed(1M) or GateD, for its routing ta<hy>
ble by sending a request or poll command. The routing information in any routing response packets returned is dis<hy>
played numerically and symbolically.
By default, rtquery uses the request command. When the -p option is specified, rtquery uses the poll command, an
undocumented extension to the RIP protocol supported by GateD. When querying GateD, the poll command is pre<hy>
ferred over the request command because the response is not subject to Split Horizon and/or Poisoned Reverse, and
because some versions of GateD do not answer the request command. in.routed does not answer the poll command,
but recognizes requests coming from rtquery and so answers completely.
The rtquery command is also used to turn tracing on or off in in.routed.
The following options are supported:
-a passwd=XXX
-a md5_passwd=XXX|KeyID Causes the query to be sent with the indicated cleartext or MD5 password.
-n Displays only the numeric network and host addresses instead of both numeric and symbolic names.
-p Uses the poll command to request full routing information from GateD. This is an undocumented extension RIP
protocol supported only by GateD.
-r addr Asks about the route to destination addr.
-t operation Changes tracing, where operation is one of the actions listed below. Requests from processes not run<hy>
ning with UID 0 or on distant networks are generally ignored by the daemon except for a message in the system log.
GateD is likely to ignore these debugging requests.
on=tracefile Turns tracing on, directing tracing into the specified file. That file must have been specified when the
daemon was started or have the name, /var/log/in.routed.trace.
more Increases the debugging level.
off Turns off tracing.
dump Dumps the daemon's routing table to the current trace file.
-w timeout Changes the delay for an answer from each host. By default, each host is given 15 seconds to respond.
-1 Queries using RIP version 1 instead of RIP version 2.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred.
