rpc.rexd, rexd <-> RPC-based remote execution server
/usr/sbin/rpc.rexd [-s]
rpc.rexd is the Sun RPC server for remote program execution. This daemon is started by inetd(1M) whenever a re<hy>
mote execution request is made.
For non-interactive programs, the standard file descriptors are connected directly to TCP connections. Interactive
programs involve pseudo-terminals, in a fashion that is similar to the login sessions provided by rlogin(1). This dae<hy>
mon may use NFS to mount file systems specified in the remote execution request.
There is a 10240 byte limit for arguments to be encoded and passed from the sending to the receiving system.
The following option is supported:
-s Secure. When specified, requests must have valid DES credentials. If the request does not have a DES credential
it is rejected. The default publickey credential is rejected. Only newer on(1) commands send DES credentials.
If access is denied with an authentication error, you may have to set your publickey with the chkey(1) command.
Specifying the -s option without presenting secure credentials will result in an error message: Unix too weak auth
(DesONly)!
rpc.rexd uses pam(3PAM) for account and session management. The PAM configuration policy, listed through
/etc/pam.conf, specifies the modules to be used for rpc.rexd. Here is a partial pam.conf file with rpc.rexd entries
for account and session management using the UNIX module.
 rpc.rexd account requisite pam_roles.so.1
 rpc.rexd account required pam_projects.so.1
 rpc.rexd account required pam_unix_account.so.1
 rpc.rexd session required pam_unix_session.so.1
If there are no entries for the rpc.rexd service, the entries for the "other" service will be used. rpc.rexd uses the get<hy>
pwuid() call to determine whether the given user is a legal user.
/dev/ptsn Pseudo-terminals used for interactive mode
/etc/passwd Authorized users
/tmp_rex/rexd?????? Temporary mount points for remote file systems

Diagnostic messages are normally printed on the console, and returned to the requestor.
Root cannot execute commands using rexd client programs such as on(1).
The pam_unix(5) module is no longer supported. Similar functionality is provided by pam_authtok_check(5),
pam_authtok_get(5), pam_authtok_store(5), pam_dhkeys(5), pam_passwd_auth(5), pam_unix_account(5),
pam_unix_auth(5), and pam_unix_session(5).

The rpc.rexd service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/network/rpc/rex:default
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). Responsibility for initiating and restarting this service is delegated to inetd(1M). Use inetadm(1M) to
make configuration changes and to view configuration information for this service. The service's status can be
queried using the svcs(1) command.
