The Zilog 8530 provides two serial input/output channels capable of supporting a variety of communication proto<hy>
cols. A typical system uses two or more of these devices to implement essential functions, including RS-423 ports
(which also support most RS-232 equipment), and the console keyboard and mouse devices.
The zs module is a loadable STREAMS driver that provides basic support for the Zilog 8530 hardware and basic
asynchronous communication support. The driver supports the termio(7I) device control functions specified by flags
in the c_cflag word of the termios structure and by the IGNBRK, IGNPAR, PARMRK, or INPCK flags in the
c_iflag word. All other termio(7I) functions must be performed by STREAMS modules pushed atop the driver.
When a device is opened, the ldterm(7M) and ttcompat(7M) STREAMS modules are automatically pushed on top
of the stream, providing the standard termio(7I) interface.
The character-special devices /dev/term/a and /dev/term/b are used to access the two serial ports on the CPU
board.
Valid name space entries are /dev/cua/[a-z], /dev/term/[a-z] and /dev/tty[a-z]. The number of entries used in a name
space are machine dependent.
To allow a single tty line to be connected to a modem and used for both incoming and outgoing calls, a special fea<hy>
ture is available that is controlled by the minor device number. By accessing character-special devices with names of
the form /dev/cua/[n], it is possible to open a port without the Carrier Detect signal being asserted, either through
hardware or an equivalent software mechanism. These devices are commonly known as dial-out lines.
Once a /dev/cua/[n] line is opened, the corresponding tty line cannot be opened until the /dev/cua/n line is closed. A
blocking open will wait until the /dev/cua/[n] line is closed (which will drop Data Terminal Ready, and Carrier
Detect) and carrier is detected again. A non-blocking open will return an error. If the tty line has been opened suc<hy>
cessfully (usually only when carrier is recognized on the modem) , the corresponding /dev/cua/[n] line cannot be
opened. This allows a modem to be attached to /dev/term/[n] (renamed from /dev/tty[n]) and used for dial-in (by
enabling the line for login in /etc/inittab) and also used for dial-out (by tip(1) or uucp(1C)) as /dev/cua/[n] when no
one is logged in on the line. Note -
This module is affected by the setting of specific eeprom variables. For information on parameters that are persistent
across reboots, see the eeprom(1M) man page.
The zs module supports the standard set of termio ioctl() calls.
If the CRTSCTS flag in the c_cflag field is set, output will be generated only if CTS is high; if CTS is low, output
will be frozen. If the CRTSCTS flag is clear, the state of CTS has no effect.
If the CRTSXOFF flag in the c_cflag field is set, input will be received only if RTS is high; if RTS is low, input
will be frozen. If the CRTSXOFF flag is clear, the state of RTS has no effect.
The termios CRTSCTS (respectively CRTSXOFF) flag and termiox CTSXON (respectively RTSXOFF) can be
used interchangeably.
Breaks can be generated by the TCSBRK, TIOCSBRK, and TIOCCBRK ioctl() calls.
The state of the DCD, CTS, RTS, and DTR interface signals may be queried through the use of the TIOCM_CAR,
TIOCM_CTS, TIOCM_RTS, and TIOCM_DTR arguments to the TIOCMGET ioctl command, respectively.
Due to hardware limitations, only the RTS and DTR signals may be set through their respective arguments to the
TIOCMSET, TIOCMBIS, and TIOCMBIC ioctl commands.
The input and output line speeds may be set to any of the speeds supported by termio. The input and output line
speeds cannot be set independently; for example, when you set the the output speed, the input speed is automatically
set to the same speed.

When the driver is used to service the serial console port, it supports a BREAK condition that allows the system to
enter the debugger or the monitor. The BREAK condition is generated by hardware and it is usually enabled by de<hy>
fault. A BREAK condition originating from erroneous electrical signals cannot be distinguished from one deliberate<hy>
ly sent by remote DCE. The Alternate Break sequence can be used to remedy this.
Due to a risk of incorrect sequence interpretation, SLIP and certain other binary protocols should not be run over the
serial console port when Alternate Break sequence is in effect. Although PPP is a binary protocol, it is able to avoid
these sequences using the ACCM feature in RFC 1662. For Solaris PPP 4.0, you do this by adding the following line
to the /etc/ppp/options file (or other configuration files used for the connection; see pppd(1M) for details):
 asyncmap 0x00002000
By default, the Alternate Break sequence is three characters: carriage return, tilde and control-B (CR ~ CTRL-B), but
may be changed by the driver. For more information on breaking (entering the debugger or monitor), see kbd(1) and
kb(7M).
An open will fail under the following conditions:
ENXIO The unit being opened does not exist.
EBUSY The dial-out device is being opened and the dial-in device is already open, or the dial-in device is being
opened with a no-delay open and the dial-out device is already open.
EBUSY The port is in use by another serial protocol.
EBUSY The unit has been marked as exclusive-use by another process with a TIOCEXCL ioctl() call.
EINTR The open was interrupted by the delivery of a signal.
