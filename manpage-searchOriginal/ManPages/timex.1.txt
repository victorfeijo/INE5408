timex <-> time a command; report process data and system activity
timex [-o] [-p [-fhkmrt]] [-s] command
The given command is executed; the elapsed time, user time and system time spent in execution are reported in sec<hy>
onds. Optionally, process accounting data for the command and all its children can be listed or summarized, and to<hy>
tal system activity during the execution interval can be reported.
The output of timex is written on standard error.
The following options are supported:
-o Report the total number of blocks read or written and total characters transferred by command and all its chil<hy>
dren. This option works only if the process accounting software is installed.
-p List process accounting records for command and all its children. This option works only if the process account<hy>
ing software is installed. Suboptions f, h, k, m, r, and t modify the data items reported. The options are as follows:
-f Print the fork(2)/ exec(2) flag and system exit status columns in the output.
-h Instead of mean memory size, show the fraction of total available CPU time consumed by the process during its
execution. This ``hog factor'' is computed as (total CPU time)/(elapsed time).
-k Instead of memory size, show total kcore-minutes.
-m Show mean core size (the default).
-r Show CPU factor (user time/(system-time + user-time)).
-t Show separate system and user CPU times. The number of blocks read or written and the number of characters
transferred are always reported.
-s Report total system activity (not just that due to command) that occurred during the execution interval of com<hy>
mand. All the data items listed in sar(1) are reported.
Example 1 Examples of timex.
A simple example:
 example% timex -ops sleep 60
A terminal session of arbitrary complexity can be measured by timing a sub-shell:
 example% timex -opskmt sh

Process records associated with command are selected from the accounting file /var/adm/pacct by inference, since
process genealogy is not available. Background processes having the same user ID, terminal ID, and execution time
window will be spuriously included.
