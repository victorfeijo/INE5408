munmap <-> unmap pages of memory
#include <sys/mman.h>
int munmap(void *addr, size_t len);
The munmap() function removes the mappings for pages in the range [addr, addr + len), rounding the len argument
up to the next multiple of the page size as returned by sysconf(3C). If addr is not the address of a mapping estab<hy>
lished by a prior call to mmap(2), the behavior is undefined. After a successful call to munmap() and before any
subsequent mapping of the unmapped pages, further references to these pages will result in the delivery of a SIG<hy>
BUS or SIGSEGV signal to the process.
The mmap(2) function often performs an implicit munmap().
Upon successful completion, munmap() returns 0; otherwise, it returns <mi>1 and sets errno to indicate an error.
The munmap() function will fail if:
EINVAL The addr argument is not a multiple of the page size as returned by sysconf(3C); addresses in the range
[addr, addr + len) are outside the valid range for the address space of a process; or the len argument has a value less
than or equal to 0.
