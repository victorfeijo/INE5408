puts, fputs <-> put a string on a stream
#include <stdio.h>
int puts(const char *s);
int fputs(const char *s, FILE *stream);
The puts() function writes the string pointed to by s, followed by a NEWLINE character, to the standard output
stream stdout (see Intro(3)). The terminating null byte is not written.
The fputs() function writes the null-terminated string pointed to by s to the named output stream. The terminating
null byte is not written.
The st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the file will be marked for update between the successful execution of fputs()
and the next successful completion of a call to fflush(3C) or fclose(3C) on the same stream or a call to exit(2) or
abort(3C).
On successful completion, both functions return the number of bytes written; otherwise they return EOF and set er<hy>
rno to indicate the error.
Refer to fputc(3C).
Unlike puts(), the fputs() function does not write a NEWLINE character at the end of the string.
