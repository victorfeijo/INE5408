wmemmove <-> copy wide-characters in memory with overlapping areas
#include <wchar.h>
wchar_t *wmemmove(wchar_t *ws1, const wchar_t *ws2, size_t n);
The wmemmove() function copies n wide-characters from the object pointed to by ws2 to the object pointed to by
ws1. Copying takes place as if the n wide-characters from the object pointed to by ws2 are first copied into a tempo<hy>
rary array of n wide-characters that does not overlap the objects pointed to by ws1 or ws2, and then the n wide-char<hy>
acters from the temporary array are copied into the object pointed to by ws1.
This function is not affected by locale and all wchar_t values are treated identically. The null wide-character and
wchar_t values not corresponding to valid characters are not treated specially.
If n is 0, ws1 and ws2 must be a valid pointers, and the function copies zero wide-characters.
The wmemmove() function returns the value of ws1.
No errors are defined.
