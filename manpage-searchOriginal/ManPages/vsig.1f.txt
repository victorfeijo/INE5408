vsig <-> synchronize a co-process with the controlling FMLI application
vsig
The vsig executable sends a SIGUSR2 signal to the controlling FMLI process. This signal/alarm causes FMLI to
execute the FMLI built-in command checkworld which causes all posted objects with a reread descriptor evaluat<hy>
ing to TRUE to be reread. vsig takes no arguments. Example 1 A sample output of vsig command.
The following is a segment of a shell program:
 echo "Sending this string to an FMLI process"
 vsig
The vsig executable will flush the output buffer before it sends the SIGUSR2 signal to make sure the string is actual<hy>
ly in the pipe created by the cocreate function.

Because vsig synchronize with FMLI, it should be used rather than kill to send a SIGUSR2 signal to FMLI.
