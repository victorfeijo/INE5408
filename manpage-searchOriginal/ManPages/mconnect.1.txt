mconnect <-> connect to SMTP mail server socket
mconnect [-p port] [-r] [hostname]
The mconnect utility opens a connection to the mail server on a given host, so that it can be tested independently of
all other mail software. If no host is given, the connection is made to the local host. Servers expect to speak the Sim<hy>
ple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) on this connection. Exit by typing the quit command. Typing EOF sends an end
of file to the server. An interrupt closes the connection immediately and exits.
The following options are supported:
-pport Specify the port number instead of the default SMTP port (number 25) as the next argument.
-r Raw mode: disable the default line buffering and input handling. This produces an effect similar to telnet(1) to
port number 25.
The following operand is supported:
hostname The name of a given host.
The mconnect command is IPv6-enabled. See ip6(7P).
