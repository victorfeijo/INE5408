_lwp_info <-> return the time-accounting information of a single LWP
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <sys/lwp.h>
int _lwp_info(struct lwpinfo *buffer);
The _lwp_info() function fills the lwpinfo structure pointed to by buffer with time-accounting information pertain<hy>
ing to the calling LWP. This call may be extended in the future to return other information to the lwpinfo structure
as needed. The lwpinfo structure in <sys/lwp.h> includes the following members:
 timestruc_t lwp_utime;
 timestruc_t lwp_stime;
The lwp_utime member is the CPU time used while executing instructions in the user space of the calling LWP.
The lwp_stime member is the CPU time used by the system on behalf of the calling LWP.
Upon successful completion, _lwp_info() returns 0 and fills in the lwpinfo structure pointed to by buffer.
If the following condition is detected, _lwp_info() returns the corresponding value:
EFAULT The buffer argument points to an illegal address.
Additionally, the _lwp_info() function will fail for 32-bit interfaces if:
EOVERFLOW The size of the tv_sec member of the timestruc_t type pointed to by lwp_utime and lwp_stime is
too small to contain the correct number of seconds.
