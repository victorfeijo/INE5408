ipw <-> Intel Pro. Wireless 802.11b IPW2100B driver
The ipw 802.11b wireless NIC driver is a multi-threaded, loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based STREAMS driver sup<hy>
porting the Data Link Provider Interface, dlpi(7P), on Intel Pro Wireless 2100B chipset-based wireless NIC's. Driv<hy>
er functions include controller initialization, wireless 802.11b infrastructure network connection, WEP, frame
transmit and receive and promiscuous support.
The ipw driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rate and mode. Supported 802.11b data rates are 1,
2, 5.5 and 11 Mbits/sec.
The ipw driver supports only BSS networks (also known as "ap" or "infrastructure" networks) and the "open"
("open-system") or "shared system" authentication. Only WEP encryption is currently supported. You perform con<hy>
figuration and administration tasks using the dladm(1M) and wificonfig(1M) utilities.
/dev/ipw* Special character device.
/kernel/drv/ipw 32-bit ELF kernel module (x86).
/kernel/drv/amd64/ipw 64-bit ELF kernel module (x86).
