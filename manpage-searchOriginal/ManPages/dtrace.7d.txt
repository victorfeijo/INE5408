dtrace <-> DTrace dynamic tracing facility
The dtrace driver provides the dynamic instrumentation and tracing facilities for the DTrace software, as well as the
built-in dtrace provider. The dtrace driver is not a public interface and you access the instrumentation offered by
this provider through DTrace tools such as dtrace(1M). Refer to the Solaris Dynamic Tracing Guide for a descrip<hy>
tion of the public documented interfaces available for the DTrace facility and dtrace provider probes.
