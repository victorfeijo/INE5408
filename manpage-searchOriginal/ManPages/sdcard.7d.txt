sdcard <-> SD/MMC memory card driver
The sdcard memory card driver supports MultiMediaCard (MMC), Secure Digital (SD), and Secure Digital High
Capacity (SDHC) memory cards. It uses the blk2scsa(7D) service to present these cards to the system as SCSI disks
on a virtual SCSI bus, creating a child device to be serviced with sd(7D). Each card appears as its own SCSI LUN.
Cards are hot-pluggable and removable.
Disk block special file names are located in /dev/dsk. Raw file names are located in /dev/rdsk. See sd(7D).
See dkio(7I)
See sd(7D) and blk2scsa(7D). Additionally, sdcard may issue the following warnings, which indicate a failure to
identify the card as a supported type:
 "Unknown SD CSD version (%d)"
 "Unknown MMC CSD version (%d)"
 "Unknown MMCA version (%d)"
 "Card type unknown"
Device special files for the storage device are created in the same way as those for a SCSI disk. See sd(7D) for more
information.
/dev/dsk/cntndnsn Block files for disks.
/dev/rdsk/cntndnsn Raw files for disks.
