Intro, intro <-> introduction to file formats
This section outlines the formats of various files. The C structure declarations for the file formats are given where
applicable. Usually, the headers containing these structure declarations can be found in the directories /usr/include
or /usr/include/sys. For inclusion in C language programs, however, the syntax #include <filename.h> or #include
<sys/filename.h> should be used.
