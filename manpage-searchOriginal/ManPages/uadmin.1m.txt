uadmin <-> administrative control
/usr/sbin/uadmin cmd fcn [mdep]
/sbin/uadmin cmd fcn [mdep]
The uadmin command provides control for basic administrative functions. This command is tightly coupled to the
system administration procedures and is not intended for general use. It may be invoked only by the super-user.
Both the cmd (command) and fcn (function) arguments are converted to integers and passed to the uadmin system
call. The optional mdep (machine dependent) argument is only available for the cmd values of 1 (A_REBOOT), 2
(A_SHUTDOWN), or 5 (A_DUMP). For any other cmd value, no mdep command-line argument is allowed.
When passing an mdep value that contains whitespaces, the string must be grouped together as a single argument en<hy>
closed within quotes, for example:
 uadmin 1 1 "-s kernel/unix"

Shutting down or halting the system by means of uadmin does not update the boot archive. Avoid using this
command after <bu> editing of files such as /etc/system <bu> installing new driver binaries or kernel binaries <bu> updating ex<hy>
isting driver binaries or kernel binaries.
Use reboot(1M) or halt(1M) instead.
