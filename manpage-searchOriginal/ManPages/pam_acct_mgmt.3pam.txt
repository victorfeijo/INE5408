int pam_acct_mgmt(pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags);
The pam_acct_mgmt() function is called to determine if the current user's account is valid. It checks for password
and account expiration, and verifies access hour restrictions. This function is typically called after the user has been
authenticated with pam_authenticate(3PAM).
The pamh argument is an authentication handle obtained by a prior call to pam_start(). The following flags may be
set in the flags field:
PAM_SILENT The account management service should not generate any messages.
PAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK The account management service should return PAM_NEW_AUTH<hy>
TOK_REQD if the user has a null authentication token.
Upon successful completion, PAM_SUCCESS is returned. In addition to the error return values described in
pam(3PAM), the following values may be returned:
PAM_USER_UNKNOWN User not known to underlying account management module.
PAM_AUTH_ERR Authentication failure.
PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD New authentication token required. This is normally returned if the machine se<hy>
curity policies require that the password should be changed because the password is NULL or has aged.
PAM_ACCT_EXPIRED User account has expired.
