targetGroupList A pointer to a pointer to an stmfGroupList structure. On successful return, this will contain a list of
target port group object identifiers.

FreeMemory(3STMF) when this list is no longer needed.
The following values are returned:
STMF_ERROR_NOMEM The library was unable to allocate sufficient memory for targetGroupList.
STMF_STATUS_SUCCESS The API call was successful.
