These functions evaluate the function log(x) for an entire vector of values at once. The first parameter specifies the
number of values to compute. Subsequent parameters specify the argument and result vectors. Each vector is de<hy>
scribed by a pointer to the first element and a stride, which is the increment between successive elements.
Specifically, vlog_(n, x, sx, y, sy) computes y[i * *sy] = log(x[i * *sx]) for each i = 0, 1, ..., *n - 1. The vlogf_() func<hy>
tion performs the same computation for single precision data.
These functions are not guaranteed to deliver results that are identical to the results of the log(3M) functions given
the same arguments. Non-exceptional results, however, are accurate to within a unit in the last place.
The element count *n must be greater than zero. The strides for the argument and result arrays can be arbitrary inte<hy>
gers, but the arrays themselves must not be the same or overlap. A zero stride effectively collapses an entire vector
into a single element. A negative stride causes a vector to be accessed in descending memory order, but note that the
corresponding pointer must still point to the first element of the vector to be used; if the stride is negative, this will
be the highest-addressed element in memory. This convention differs from the Level 1 BLAS, in which array param<hy>
eters always refer to the lowest-addressed element in memory even when negative increments are used.
These functions assume that the default round-to-nearest rounding direction mode is in effect. On x86, these func<hy>
tions also assume that the default round-to-64-bit rounding precision mode is in effect. The result of calling a vector
function with a non-default rounding mode in effect is undefined.
These functions handle special cases and exceptions in the same way as the log() functions when c99 MATHER<hy>
REXCEPT conventions are in effect. See log(3M) for the results for special cases.
An application wanting to check for exceptions should call feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these
functions. On return, if fetestexcept(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDER<hy>
FLOW) is non-zero, an exception has been raised. The application can then examine the result or argument vectors
for exceptional values. Some vector functions can raise the inexact exception even if all elements of the argument ar<hy>
ray are such that the numerical results are exact.
