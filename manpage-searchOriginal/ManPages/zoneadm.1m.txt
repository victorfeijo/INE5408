 [list_options]
zoneadm [-R root] -z zonename [-u uuid-match] mark incomplete
The zoneadm utility is used to administer system zones. A zone is an application container that is maintained by the
operating system runtime.
Once a process has been placed in a zone other than zone 0, the process or any of its children cannot change zones.
The following options are supported:
-R root
Specify an alternate root (boot environment). This option can only be used in conjunction with the "list" and "mark"
subcommands.
-u uuid-match
Unique identifier for a zone, as assigned by libuuid(3LIB). If this option is present and the argument is a non-empty
string, then the zone matching the UUID is selected instead of the one named by the -z option, if such a zone is
present.
-z zonename
String identifier for a zone.
Subcommands which can result in destructive actions or loss of work have a -F flag to force the action. If input is
from a terminal device, the user is prompted if such a command is given without the -F flag; otherwise, if such a
command is given without the -F flag, the action is disallowed, with a diagnostic message written to standard error.
If a zone installation or uninstallation is interrupted, the zone is left in the incomplete state. Use uninstall to reset
such a zone back to the configured state.
The following subcommands are supported:
attach [-F] [-n path] [brand-specific options]
The attach subcommand takes a zone that has been detached from one system and attaches the zone onto a new sys<hy>
tem. Therefore, it is advised (though not required) that the detach subcommand should be run before the "attach"
takes place. Once you have the new zone in the configured state, use the attach subcommand to set up the zone root
instead of installing the zone as a new zone.
The -F option can be used to force the zone into the "installed" state with no validation. This option should be used
with care since it can leave the zone in an unsupportable state if it was moved from a source system to a target sys<hy>
tem that is unable to properly host the zone. The -n option can be used to run the attach subcommand, without ex<hy>
ecuting the command. It uses the output of the "detach -n" subcommand as input and is useful to identify any con<hy>
flicting issues, such as the network device being incompatible, and can also determine whether the host is capable of
supporting the zone. The path can be "-", to read the input from standard input.
The zone's brand may include additional options that govern how the zone will be attached. See brands(5) for spe<hy>
cific brand information.
The zone being attached must first be configured using the zonecfg (see zonecfg(1M)) command. This does not ap<hy>
ply when running "attach -n".
Use the following command to attach a zone:
 # zoneadm -z my-zone attach
<beginning of page>
boot [-- boot_options]
Boot (or activate) the specified zones.
The following boot_options are supported:
-i altinit
Select an alternative executable to be the primordial Process. altinit is a valid path to an executable. The default pri<hy>
mordial process is init(1M).
-m smf_options
The smf_options include two categories of options to control booting behavior of the service management facility:
recovery options and messages options.
Message options determine the type and amount of messages that smf(5) displays during boot. Service options de<hy>
termine the services which are used to boot the system. See kernel(1M) for a listing of the -m suboptions.
-s
Boots only to milestone svc:/milestone/single-user:default. This milestone is equivalent to init level s. See
svc.startd(1M) and init(1M).
clone [-m copy] [-s zfs_snapshot] source_zone
Install a zone by copying an existing installed zone. This subcommand is an alternative way to install the zone.
-m copy
Force the clone to be a copy, even if a "ZFS clone" is possible.
-s zfs_snapshot
Specify the name of a ZFS snapshot to use as the source of the clone. The snapshot must be a snapshot of the source
zone taken from a previous "zoneadm clone" installation.
The source zone must be halted before this subcommand can be used.
detach [-n]
Detach the specified zone. Detaching a zone is the first step in moving a zone from one system to another. The full
procedure to migrate a zone is that the zone is detached, the zonepath directory is moved to the new host, and then
the zone is attached on the new host. Once the zone is detached, it is left in the configured state. If you try to install
or clone to a configured zone that has been detached, you will receive an error message and the install or clone sub<hy>
command will not be allowed to proceed. The -n option can be used to run the detach subcommand, without execut<hy>
ing the command. This generates the information needed for running the "attach -n" subcommand, which is useful
to identify any conflicting issues, such as the network device being incompatible or if the host is capable of support<hy>
ing the zone. The information is sent to standard output and can be saved to a file or piped to the "attach -n" sub<hy>
command.
Use the following command to detach a zone:
 # zoneadm -z my-zone detach
The source zone must be halted before this subcommand can be used.
halt
Halt the specified zones. halt bypasses running the shutdown scripts inside the zone. It also removes run time re<hy>
<beginning of page>
sources of the zone.
Use:
 zlogin zone shutdown
to cleanly shutdown the zone by running the shutdown scripts.
help [subcommand]
Display general help. If you specify subcommand, displays help on subcommand.
install [-x nodataset] [brand-specific options]
Install the specified zone on the system. This subcommand automatically attempts to verify first. It refuses to install
if the verify step fails. See the verify subcommand.
-x nodataset
Do not create a ZFS file system.
The zone's brand may include additional options that govern how the software will be installed in the zone. See
brands(5) for specific brand information.
list [list_options]
Display the name of the current zones, or the specified zone if indicated.
By default, all running zones are listed. If you use this subcommand with the zoneadm -z zonename option, it lists
only the specified zone, regardless of its state. In this case, the -i and -c options are disallowed.
If neither the -i or -c options are given, all running zones are listed.
The following list_options are supported:
-c
Display all configured zones. This option overides the -i option.
-i
Expand the display to all installed zones.
-p
Request machine parsable output. The output format is a list of lines, one per zone, with colon- delimited fields.
These fields are:
 zoneid:zonename:state:zonepath:uuid:brand:ip-type
If the zonepath contains embedded colons, they can be escaped by a backslash (""), which is parsable by using the
shell read(1) function with the environmental variable IFS. The uuid value is assigned by libuuid(3LIB) when the
zone is installed, and is useful for identifying the same zone when present (or renamed) on alternate boot environ<hy>
ments. Any software that parses the output of the "zoneadm list -p" command must be able to handle any fields that
may be added in the future.
The -v and -p options are mutually exclusive. If neither -v nor -p is used, just the zone name is listed.
-v
Display verbose information, including zone name, id, current state, root directory, brand type, ip-type, and options.
<beginning of page>
The -v and -p options are mutually exclusive. If neither -v nor -p is used, just the zone name is listed.
mark incomplete
Change the state of an installed zone to "incomplete." This command may be useful in cases where administrative
changes on the system have rendered a zone unusable or inconsistent. This change cannot be undone (except by
uninstalling the zone).
move new_zonepath
Move the zonepath to new_zonepath. The zone must be halted before this subcommand can be used. The
new_zonepath must be a local file system and normal restrictions for zonepath apply.
ready
Prepares a zone for running applications but does not start any user processes in the zone.
reboot
Restart the zones. This is equivalent to a halt boot sequence. This subcommand fails if the specified zones are not
active.
uninstall [-F]
Uninstall the specified zone from the system. Use this subcommand with caution. It removes all of the files under the
zonepath of the zone in question. You can use the -F flag to force the action.
verify
Check to make sure the configuration of the specified zone can safely be installed on the machine. Following is a
break-down of the checks by resource/property type:
zonepath
zonepath and its parent directory exist and are owned by root with appropriate modes . The appropriate modes are
that zonepath is 700, its parent is not group or world-writable and so forth. zonepath is not over an NFS mount. A
sub-directory of the zonepath named "root" does not exist.
If zonepath does not exist, the verify does not fail, but merely warns that a subsequent install will attempt to create
it with proper permissions. A verify subsequent to that might fail should anything go wrong.
zonepath cannot be a symbolic link.
fs
Any fs resources have their type value checked. An error is reported if the value is one of proc, mntfs, autofs,
cachefs, or nfs or the filesystem does not have an associated mount binary at /usr/lib/fs/<fstype>/mount.
It is an error for the directory to be a relative path.
It is an error for the path specified by raw to be a relative path or if there is no fsck binary for a given filesystem type
at /usr/lib/fs/<fstype>/fsck. It is also an error if a corresponding fsck binary exists but a raw path is not specified.
net
All physical network interfaces exist. All network address resources are one of: <bu> a valid IPv4 address, optionally
followed by "/" and a prefix length; <bu> a valid IPv6 address, which must be followed by "/" and a prefix length; <bu> a
host name which resolves to an IPv4 address. Note that hostnames that resolve to IPv6 addresses are not supported.
The physical interface name is the network interface name.
<beginning of page>
A zone can be configured to be either exclusive-IP or shared-IP. For a shared-IP zone, both the physical and address
properties must be set. For an exclusive-IP zone, the physical property must be set and the address property cannot
be set.
rctl
It also verifies that any defined resource control values are valid on the current machine. This means that the privi<hy>
lege level is privileged, the limit is lower than the currently defined system value, and that the defined action agrees
with the actions that are valid for the given resource control.
Example 1 Using the -m Option
The following command illustrates the use of the -m option.
 # zoneadm boot -- -m verbose
Example 2 Using the -i Option
The following command illustrates the use of the -i option.
 # zoneadm boot -- -i /sbin/init
Example 3 Using the -s Option
The following command illustrates the use of the -s option.
 # zoneadm boot -- -s
The following exit values are returned:
0
Successful completion.
1
An error occurred.
2
Invalid usage.

The act of installing a new non-global zone is a fresh installation of the Solaris operating system. A new installation
of Solaris must not require interaction with the user (that is, it must be "hands off"). Because of this, packages in<hy>
stalled in the global zone and all non-global zones cannot contain request scripts (see pkgask(1M)). If a package did
have a request script, then the creation of a non-global zone could not be done without user intervention. Any pack<hy>
age that contains a request script is added to the global zone only. See pkgadd(1M).
