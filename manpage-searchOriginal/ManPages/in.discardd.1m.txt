in.discardd <-> UDP or TCP discard protocol service
in.discardd
FMRI svc:/internet/discard:default
FMRI stands for Fault Management Resource Identifier. It is used to identify resources managed by the Fault Man<hy>
ager. See fmd(1M) and smf(5).
The in.discardd service provides the server-side of the discard protocol. This protocol is used for debugging and
bandwidth measurement and is available on both TCP and UDP transports through port 9.
The in.discardd service is an inetd(1M) smf(5) delegated service. The in.discardd detects which transport is re<hy>
quested by examining the socket it is passed by the inetd daemon.
The discard service simply throws away any data it receives from the client.
TCP-based service Once a connection is established, the in.discardd discards any data received. No response is
generated. The connection remains open until the client terminates it.
UDP-based service The in.discardd listens for UDP datagrams. When a datagram is received, the server discards it.
No response is sent.
