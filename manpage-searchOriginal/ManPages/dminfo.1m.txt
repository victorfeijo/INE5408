dminfo reports and updates information about the device_maps(4) file.
The following options are supported
-a Succeed if any of the requested entries are found. If used with -v, all entries that match the requested case(s) are
printed.
-d dev<mi>path Search by dev<mi>path. Search device_maps(4) for a device special pathname in the device_list field
matching the dev<mi>path argument. This option cannot be used with -n, -t or -u.
-f pathname Use a device_maps file with pathname instead of /etc/security/device_maps.
-n dev<mi>name Search by dev<mi>name. Search device_maps(4) for a device_name field matching dev<mi>name. This op<hy>
tion cannot be used with -d, -t or -u.
-t dev<mi>type Search by dev<mi>type. Search device_maps(4) for a device_type field matching the given dev<mi>type. This
option cannot be used with -d, -n or -u.
-u dm<mi>entry Update the device_maps(4) file. This option is provided to add entries to the device_maps(4) file. The
dm<mi>entry must be a complete device_maps(4) file entry. The dm<mi>entry has fields, as in the device_maps file. It uses
the colon (:) as a field separator, and white space as the device_list subfield separators. The dm<mi>entry is not made if
any fields are missing, or if the dm<mi>entry would be a duplicate. The default device maps file can be updated only by
the super user.
-v Verbose. Print the requested entry or entries, one line per entry, on the standard output. If no entries are specified,
all are printed.
0 Successful completion.
