uname <-> get name of current operating system
#include <sys/utsname.h>
int uname(struct utsname *name);
The uname() function stores information identifying the current operating system in the structure pointed to by
name.
The uname() function uses the utsname structure, defined in <sys/utsname.h>, whose members include:
 char sysname[SYS_NMLN];
 char nodename[SYS_NMLN];
 char release[SYS_NMLN];
 char version[SYS_NMLN];
 char machine[SYS_NMLN];
The uname() function returns a null-terminated character string naming the current operating system in the character
array sysname. Similarly, the nodename member contains the name by which the system is known on a communi<hy>
cations network. The release and version members further identify the operating system. The machine member
contains a standard name that identifies the hardware on which the operating system is running.
Upon successful completion, a non-negative value is returned. Otherwise, <mi>1 is returned and errno is set to indicate
the error.
The uname() function will fail if:
EFAULT The name argument points to an illegal address.
