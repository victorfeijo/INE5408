The kvm_kread() function transfers data from the kernel address space to the address space of the process. nbytes
bytes of data are copied from the kernel virtual address given by addr to the buffer pointed to by buf.
The kvm_kwrite() function is like kvm_kread(), except that the direction of the transfer is reversed. To use this
function, the kvm_open(3KVM) call that returned kd must have specified write access.
The kvm_uread() function transfers data from the address space of the processes specified in the most recent
kvm_getu(3KVM) call. nbytes bytes of data are copied from the user virtual address given by addr to the buffer
pointed to by buf.
The kvm_uwrite() function is like kvm_uread(), except that the direction of the transfer is reversed. To use this
function, the kvm_open(3KVM) call that returned kd must have specified write access. The address is resolved in
the address space of the process specified in the most recent kvm_getu(3KVM) call.
On success, these functions return the number of bytes actually transferred. On failure, they return <mi>1.
