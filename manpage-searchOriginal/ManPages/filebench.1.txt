filebench <-> framework of workloads to measure and compare filesystem performance
/usr/benchmarks/filebench/bin/filebench profile
/usr/benchmarks/filebench/bin/filebench -c stats_dir...
filebench runs workloads to measure and compare filesystem performance.
Full documentation can be found at the performance community at: http://www.opensolaris.org
The following options are supported:
-c stats_dir... Generates a HTML file (index.html) that is a comparison of the specified directories. stats_dir speci<hy>
fies the directory or directories in which the results are stored.
The following operands are supported:
profile Specifies the name of the configuration file ending in .prof. The configuration file specifies: <bu> what workloads
to run, <bu> what parameters to run, <bu> the directory path on which to operate, and <bu> the directory path in which to store
the results.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
1 An error occurred.
2 Invalid command line options were specified.
Example 1 Running the Multi-stream Sequential Read Workload
The following example runs the workloads described in the configuration file named sqread.prof:
 # filebench sqread
Example 2 Comparing Multiple Runs
The following example compares the results of two previous runs.
This example assumes that the results from the two previous filebench runs were located in the directories:
/stats/wombat-zfs-noel-Jun_27_2007-15h_45m_33s and /stats/wombat-ufs-noel-Jun_27_2007-15h_52m_11s.
This example generates a HTML file named index.html in your current working directory.
 # filebench -c /stats/wombat-zfs-noel-Jun_27_2007-15h_45m_33s \
  /stats/wombat-ufs-noel-Jun_27_2007-15h_52m_11s
