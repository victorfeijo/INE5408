usb_ac <-> USB audio control driver
sound-control@unit-address
The usb_ac driver is a USBA (Solaris USB Architecture) compliant client driver that supports the USB Audio Class
1.0 specification.
The audio control driver is a USB class driver and offers functionality similar to the audiocs (sun4u) and audiots
(Sun Blade 100) drivers which use the Solaris audio mixer framework (mixer(7I)). Unlike the audiocs and audiots
drivers, the USB audio device can have play-only or record-only capability.
Drivers corresponding to other USB audio interfaces on the device, including the usb_as(7D) audio streaming driver
or the hid(7D) driver, are plumbed under the USB audio control driver and do not directly interface with user appli<hy>
cations.
The usb_ac driver supports USB audio class compliant devices with a feature unit.
If a device is hot-removed while it is active, all subsequent opens returns EIO. All other errors are defined in the au<hy>
dio(7I) man page.
