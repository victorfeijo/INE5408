for SCSI devices
These are optional properties, typically created by the system, for SCSI target devices. References to these proper<hy>
ties should use their sys/scsi/impl/inquiry.h defined names.
inquiry-device-type is an integer property. When present, the least significant byte of the value indicates the device
type as defined by the SCSI standard. Consumers of this property should compare the property values with
DTYPE_* values defined in sys/scsi/generic/inquiry.h.
inquiry-vendor-id is a string property. When present, it contains the vendor information. This information typically
comes from the scsi_inquiry(9S) "inq_vid" field.
inquiry-product-id is a string property. When present, it contains the product identification. This information typi<hy>
cally comes from the scsi_inquiry(9S) "inq_pid" field.

comes from the scsi_inquiry(9S) "inq_rev" field.
inquiry-serial-no is a string property. When present, it contains the serial number. The serial number is typically ob<hy>
tained from the EVPD "Unit Serial Number" SCSI INQUIRY data (page 0x80).
