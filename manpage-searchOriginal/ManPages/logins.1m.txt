/usr/bin/logins [-admopstux] [-g group...]
 [-l login_name...]
This command displays information on user and system logins known to the system. Contents of the output is con<hy>
trolled by the command options and can include the following: user or system login, user id number, passwd ac<hy>
count field value (user name or other information), primary group name, primary group id, multiple group names,
multiple group ids, home directory, login shell, and four password aging parameters. The default information is the
following: login id, user id, primary group name, primary group id and the account field value. Output is sorted by
user id, system logins, followed by user logins.
Options may be used together. If so, any login that matches any criteria are displayed.
The following options are supported:
-a Add two password expiration fields to the display. The fields show how many days a password can remain unused
before it automatically becomes inactive, and the date that the password expires.
-d Selects logins with duplicate uids.
-g group Selects all users belonging to group, sorted by login. Multiple groups can be specified as a comma-separat<hy>
ed list. When the -l and -g options are combined, a user is only listed once, even if the user belongs to more than one
of the selected groups.
-l login_name... Selects the requested login. Multiple logins can be specified as a comma-separated list. Depending
on the nameservice lookup types set in /etc/nsswitch.conf, the information can come from the /etc/passwd and
/etc/shadow files and other nameservices. When the -l and -g options are combined, a user is only listed once, even
if the user belongs to more than one of the selected groups.
-m Displays multiple group membership information.
-o Formats output into one line of colon-separated fields.
-p Selects logins with no passwords.
-s Selects all system logins.
-t Sorts output by login instead of by uid.
-u Selects all user logins.
-x Prints an extended set of information about each selected user. The extended information includes home directory,
login shell and password aging information, each displayed on a separate line. The password information currently
consists of password status:
NP Account has no password
LK Account is locked for UNIX authentication
NL Account is a no login account
<beginning of page>
PS Account probably has a valid password
UN Account password status is unknown. That is, it is not a recognizable hashed password or any of the above en<hy>
tries. See crypt(3C) for valid password hashes.
If the login is passworded, status is followed by the date the password was last changed, the number of days required
between changes, and the number of days allowed before a change is required. The password aging information
shows the time interval that the user receives a password expiration warning message (when logging on) before the
password expires.
