sigqueue <-> queue a signal to a process
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <signal.h>
int sigqueue(pid_t pid, int signo, const union sigval value);
The sigqueue() function causes the signal specified by signo to be sent with the value specified by value to the
process specified by pid. If signo is 0 (the null signal), error checking is performed but no signal is actually sent. The
null signal can be used to check the validity of pid.
The conditions required for a process to have permission to queue a signal to another process are the same as for the
kill(2) function.
The sigqueue() function returns immediately. If SA_SIGINFO is set for signo and if the resources were available to
queue the signal, the signal is queued and sent to the receiving process. If SA_SIGINFO is not set for signo, then
signo is sent at least once to the receiving process; it is unspecified whether value will be sent to the receiving
process as a result of this call.
If the value of pid causes signo to be generated for the sending process, and if signo is not blocked for the calling
thread and if no other thread has signo unblocked or is waiting in a sigwait(2) function for signo, either signo or at
least the pending, unblocked signal will be delivered to the calling thread before the sigqueue() function returns.
Should any of multiple pending signals in the range SIGRTMIN to SIGRTMAX be selected for delivery, it will be
the lowest numbered one. The selection order between realtime and non-realtime signals, or between multiple pend<hy>
ing non-realtime signals, is unspecified.
Upon successful completion, the specified signal will have been queued, and the sigqueue() function returns 0. Oth<hy>
erwise, the function returns <mi>1 and sets errno to indicate the error.
The sigqueue() function will fail if:
EAGAIN No resources are available to queue the signal. The process has already queued SIGQUEUE_MAX sig<hy>
nals that are still pending at the receiver(s), or a system wide resource limit has been exceeded.
EINVAL The value of signo is an invalid or unsupported signal number.
ENOSYS The sigqueue() function is not supported by the system.
EPERM The process does not have the appropriate privilege to send the signal to the receiving process.
ESRCH The process pid does not exist.
