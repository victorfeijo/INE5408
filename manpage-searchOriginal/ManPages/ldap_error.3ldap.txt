These functions interpret the error codes that are returned by the LDAP API routines. The ldap_perror() and
ldap_result2error() functions are deprecated for all new development. Use ldap_err2string() instead.
You can also use ldap_parse_sasl_bind_result(3LDAP), ldap_parse_extended_result(3LDAP), and
ldap_parse_result(3LDAP) to provide error handling and interpret error codes returned by LDAP API functions.
The ldap_err2string() function takes err, a numeric LDAP error code, returned either by ldap_parse_re<hy>
sult(3LDAP) or another LDAP API call. It returns an informative, null-terminated, character string that describes the
error.
The ldap_result2error() function takes res, a result produced by ldap_result(3LDAP) or other synchronous LDAP
calls, and returns the corresponding error code. If the freeit parameter is non-zero, it indicates that the res parameter
should be freed by a call to ldap_result(3LDAP) after the error code has been extracted.
Similar to the way perror(3C) works, the ldap_perror() function can be called to print an indication of the error to
standard error.
The possible values for an LDAP error code are:
LDAP_SUCCESS
The request was successful.
LDAP_OPERATIONS_ERROR
An operations error occurred.
LDAP_PROTOCOL_ERROR
A protocol violation was detected.
LDAP_TIMELIMIT_EXCEEDED
An LDAP time limit was exceeded.
LDAP_SIZELIMIT_EXCEEDED
An LDAP size limit was exceeded.
LDAP_COMPARE_FALSE
A compare operation returned false.
LDAP_COMPARE_TRUE
A compare operation returned true.
LDAP_STRONG_AUTH_NOT_SUPPORTED
The LDAP server does not support strong authentication.
<beginning of page>
LDAP_STRONG_AUTH_REQUIRED
Strong authentication is required for the operation.
LDAP_PARTIAL_RESULTS
Only partial results are returned.
LDAP_NO_SUCH_ATTRIBUTE
The attribute type specified does not exist in the entry.
LDAP_UNDEFINED_TYPE
The attribute type specified is invalid.
LDAP_INAPPROPRIATE_MATCHING
The filter type is not supported for the specified attribute.
LDAP_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION
An attribute value specified violates some constraint. For example, a postalAddress has too many lines, or a line
that is too long.
LDAP_TYPE_OR_VALUE_EXISTS
An attribute type or attribute value specified already exists in the entry.
LDAP_INVALID_SYNTAX
An invalid attribute value was specified.
LDAP_NO_SUCH_OBJECT
The specified object does not exist in the directory.
LDAP_ALIAS_PROBLEM
An alias in the directory points to a nonexistent entry.
LDAP_INVALID_DN_SYNTAX
A syntactically invalid DN was specified.
LDAP_IS_LEAF
The object specified is a leaf.
LDAP_ALIAS_DEREF_PROBLEM
A problem was encountered when dereferencing an alias.
LDAP_INAPPROPRIATE_AUTH
Inappropriate authentication was specified. For example, LDAP_AUTH_SIMPLE was specified and the entry does
not have a userPassword attribute.
<beginning of page>
LDAP_INVALID_CREDENTIALS
Invalid credentials were presented, for example, the wrong password.
LDAP_INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS
The user has insufficient access to perform the operation.
LDAP_BUSY
The DSA is busy.
LDAP_UNAVAILABLE
The DSA is unavailable.
LDAP_UNWILLING_TO_PERFORM
The DSA is unwilling to perform the operation.
LDAP_LOOP_DETECT
A loop was detected.
LDAP_NAMING_VIOLATION
A naming violation occurred.
LDAP_OBJECT_CLASS_VIOLATION
An object class violation occurred. For example, a must attribute was missing from the entry.
LDAP_NOT_ALLOWED_ON_NONLEAF
The operation is not allowed on a nonleaf object.
LDAP_NOT_ALLOWED_ON_RDN
The operation is not allowed on an RDN.
LDAP_ALREADY_EXISTS
The entry already exists.
LDAP_NO_OBJECT_CLASS_MODS
Object class modifications are not allowed.
LDAP_OTHER
An unknown error occurred.
LDAP_SERVER_DOWN
The LDAP library cannot contact the LDAP server.
<beginning of page>
LDAP_LOCAL_ERROR
Some local error occurred. This is usually the result of a failed malloc(3C) call or a failure to fflush(3C) the stdio
stream to files, even when the LDAP requests were processed successfully by the remote server.
LDAP_ENCODING_ERROR
An error was encountered encoding parameters to send to the LDAP server.
LDAP_DECODING_ERROR
An error was encountered decoding a result from the LDAP server.
LDAP_TIMEOUT
A time limit was exceeded while waiting for a result.
LDAP_AUTH_UNKNOWN
The authentication method specified to ldap_bind(3LDAP) is not known.
LDAP_FILTER_ERROR
An invalid filter was supplied to ldap_search(3LDAP), for example, unbalanced parentheses.
LDAP_PARAM_ERROR
An LDAP function was called with a bad parameter, for example, a NULL ld pointer, and the like.
LDAP_NO_MEMORY
A memory allocation call failed in an LDAP library function, for example, malloc(3C).
LDAP_CONNECT_ERROR
The LDAP client has either lost its connetion to an LDAP server or it cannot establish a connection.
LDAP_NOT_SUPPORTED
The requested functionality is not supported., for example, when an LDAPv2 client requests some LDAPv3 func<hy>
tionality.
LDAP_CONTROL_NOT_FOUND
An LDAP client requested a control not found in the list of supported controls sent by the server.
LDAP_NO_RESULTS_RETURNED
The LDAP server sent no results.
LDAP_MORE_RESULTS_TO_RETURN
More results are chained in the message chain.
LDAP_CLIENT_LOOP
A loop has been detected, for example, when following referrals.
<beginning of page>
LDAP_REFERRAL_LIMIT_EXCEEDED
The referral exceeds the hop limit. The hop limit determines the number of servers that the client can hop through to
retrieve data.
