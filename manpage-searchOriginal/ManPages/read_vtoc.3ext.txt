int read_vtoc(int fd, struct vtoc *vtoc);

int write_extvtoc(int fd, struct extvtoc *extvtoc);
The read_vtoc() and read_extvtoc() functions return the VTOC (volume table of contents) structure that is stored
on the disk associated with the open file descriptor fd. On disks larger than 1 TB read_extvtoc() must be used.
The write_vtoc() and write_extvtoc() function stores the VTOC structure on the disk associated with the open file
descriptor fd. On disks larger then 1TB write_extvtoc() function must be used.
The fd argument refers to any slice on a raw disk.
Upon successful completion, read_vtoc() and read_extvtoc() return a positive integer indicating the slice index as<hy>
sociated with the open file descriptor. Otherwise, they return a negative integer indicating one of the following er<hy>
rors:
VT_EIO An I/O error occurred.
VT_ENOTSUP This operation is not supported on this disk.
VT_ERROR An unknown error occurred.
VT_OVERFLOW The caller attempted an operation that is illegal on the disk and may overflow the fields in the da<hy>
ta structure.
Upon successful completion, write_vtoc() and write_extvtoc() return 0. Otherwise, they return a negative integer
indicating one of the following errors:
VT_EINVAL The VTOC contains an incorrect field.
VT_EIO An I/O error occurred.
VT_ENOTSUP This operation is not supported on this disk.
VT_ERROR An unknown error occurred.
VT_OVERFLOW The caller attempted an operation that is illegal on the disk and may overflow the fields in the da<hy>
ta structure.

The write_vtoc() function cannot write a VTOC on an unlabeled disk. Use format(1M) for this purpose.
