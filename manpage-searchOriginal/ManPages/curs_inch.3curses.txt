curs_inch, inch, winch, mvinch, mvwinch <-> get a character and its attributes from a curses window
cc [ flag ... ] file ... -lcurses [ library ... ]
#include <curses.h>
chtype inch(void);
chtype winch(WINDOW *win);
chtype mvinch(int y, int x);
chtype mvwinch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);
With these routines, the character, of type chtype, at the current position in the named window is returned. If any at<hy>
tributes are set for that position, their values are OR-ed into the value returned. Constants defined in <curses.h> can
be used with the logical AND (&) operator to extract the character or attributes alone.
The following bit-masks can be AND-ed with characters returned by winch().
A_CHARTEXT Bit-mask to extract character
A_ATTRIBUTES Bit-mask to extract attributes
A_COLOR Bit-mask to extract color-pair field information
See attributes(5) for descriptions of the following attributes:
tab() box; cw(2.75i) |cw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) |lw(2.75i) ATTRIBUTE TYPEATTRIBUTE VALUE _ MT-LevelUnsafe
curses(3CURSES), attributes(5)
The header <curses.h> automatically includes the headers <stdio.h> and <unctrl.h>.
Note that all of these routines may be macros.
