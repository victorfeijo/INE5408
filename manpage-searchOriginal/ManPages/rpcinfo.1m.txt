rpcinfo makes an RPC call to an RPC server and reports what it finds.
In the first synopsis, rpcinfo lists all the registered RPC services with rpcbind on host. If host is not specified, the
local host is the default. If -s is used, the information is displayed in a concise format.
In the second synopsis, rpcinfo lists all the RPC services registered with rpcbind, version 2. Note that the format of
the information is different in the first and the second synopsis. This is because the second synopsis is an older pro<hy>
tocol used to collect the information displayed (version 2 of the rpcbind protocol).
The third synopsis makes an RPC call to procedure 0 of prognum and versnum on the specified host and reports
whether a response was received. transport is the transport which has to be used for contacting the given service.
The remote address of the service is obtained by making a call to the remote rpcbind.
The prognum argument is a number that represents an RPC program number (see rpc(4)).
If a versnum is specified, rpcinfo attempts to call that version of the specified prognum. Otherwise, rpcinfo attempts
to find all the registered version numbers for the specified prognum by calling version 0, which is presumed not to
exist; if it does exist, rpcinfo attempts to obtain this information by calling an extremely high version number in<hy>
stead, and attempts to call each registered version. Note that the version number is required for -b and -d options.
The EXAMPLES section describe other ways of using rpcinfo.
-T transport Specify the transport on which the service is required. If this option is not specified, rpcinfo uses the
transport specified in the NETPATH environment variable, or if that is unset or NULL, the transport in the netcon<hy>
fig(4) database is used. This is a generic option, and can be used in conjunction with other options as shown in the
SYNOPSIS.
-a serv_address Use serv_address as the (universal) address for the service on transport to ping procedure 0 of the
specified prognum and report whether a response was received. The -T option is required with the -a option. If ver<hy>
snum is not specified, rpcinfo tries to ping all available version numbers for that program number. This option
avoids calls to remote rpcbind to find the address of the service. The serv_address is specified in universal address
format of the given transport.
-b Make an RPC broadcast to procedure 0 of the specified prognum and versnum and report all hosts that respond. If
transport is specified, it broadcasts its request only on the specified transport. If broadcasting is not supported by any
transport, an error message is printed. Use of broadcasting should be limited because of the potential for adverse ef<hy>
fect on other systems.
-d Delete registration for the RPC service of the specified prognum and versnum. If transport is specified, unregister
the service on only that transport, otherwise unregister the service on all the transports on which it was registered.
Only the owner of a service can delete a registration, except the superuser, who can delete any service.

-l Display a list of entries with a given prognum and versnum on the specified host. Entries are returned for all trans<hy>
ports in the same protocol family as that used to contact the remote rpcbind.
-m Display a table of statistics of rpcbind operations on the given host. The table shows statistics for each version
of rpcbind (versions 2, 3 and 4), giving the number of times each procedure was requested and successfully ser<hy>
viced, the number and type of remote call requests that were made, and information about RPC address lookups that
were handled. This is useful for monitoring RPC activities on host.
-n portnum Use portnum as the port number for the -t and -u options instead of the port number given by rpcbind.
Use of this option avoids a call to the remote rpcbind to find out the address of the service. This option is made ob<hy>
solete by the -a option.
-p Probe rpcbind on host using version 2 of the rpcbind protocol, and display a list of all registered RPC programs.
If host is not specified, it defaults to the local host. This option is not useful for IPv6; use -s (see below) instead.
Note that version 2 of the rpcbind protocol was previously known as the portmapper protocol.
-s Display a concise list of all registered RPC programs on host. If host is not specified, it defaults to the local host.
-t Make an RPC call to procedure 0 of prognum on the specified host using TCP, and report whether a response was
received. This option is made obsolete by the -T option as shown in the third synopsis.
-u Make an RPC call to procedure 0 of prognum on the specified host using UDP, and report whether a response
was received. This option is made obsolete by the -T option as shown in the third synopsis.
Example 1 RPC services.
To show all of the RPC services registered on the local machine use:
 example% rpcinfo
To show all of the RPC services registered with rpcbind on the machine named klaxon use:
 example% rpcinfo klaxon
The information displayed by the above commands can be quite lengthy. Use the -s option to display a more concise
list:
 example% rpcinfo -s klaxon

To show whether the RPC service with program number prognum and version versnum is registered on the machine
<beginning of page>
named klaxon for the transport TCP use:
 example% rpcinfo -T tcp klaxon prognum versnum
To show all RPC services registered with version 2 of the rpcbind protocol on the local machine use:
 example% rpcinfo -p
To delete the registration for version 1 of the walld (program number 100008) service for all transports use:
 example# rpcinfo -d 100008 1
or
 example# rpcinfo -d walld 1
