roleadd <-> administer a new role account on the system
roleadd [-c comment] [-d dir] [-e expire] [-f inactive]
 [-g group] [-G group [, group...]] [-m [-k skel_dir]]
 [-u uid [-o]] [-s shell]
 [-A authorization [,authorization...]] [-K key=value] role
roleadd -D [-b base_dir] [-e expire] [-f inactive]
 [-g group] [-A authorization [,authorization...]]
 [-P profile [,profile...] [-K key=value]]
roleadd adds a role entry to the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow and /etc/user_attr files. The -A and -P options re<hy>
spectively assign authorizations and profiles to the role. Roles cannot be assigned to other roles. The -K option adds
a key=value pair to /etc/user_attr for a role. Multiple key=value pairs can be added with multiple -K options.
roleadd also creates supplementary group memberships for the role (-G option) and creates the home directory (-m
option) for the role if requested. The new role account remains locked until the passwd(1) command is executed.
Specifying roleadd -D with the -g, -b, -f, -e, or -K option (or any combination of these option) sets the default val<hy>
ues for the respective fields. See the -D option. Subsequent roleadd commands without the -D option use these argu<hy>
ments.
The system file entries created with this command have a limit of 512 characters per line. Specifying long arguments
to several options can exceed this limit.
The role (role) field accepts a string of no more than eight bytes consisting of characters from the set of alphabetic
characters, numeric characters, period (.), underscore (_), and hyphen (-). The first character should be alphabetic
and the field should contain at least one lower case alphabetic character. A warning message is written if these re<hy>
strictions are not met. A future Solaris release might refuse to accept role fields that do not meet these requirements.
The role field must contain at least one character and must not contain a colon (:) or a newline (\n).
The following options are supported:
-A authorization One or more comma separated authorizations defined in auth_attr(4). Only a user or role who has
grant rights to the authorization can assign it to an account
-b base_dir The default base directory for the system if -d dir is not specified. base_dir is concatenated with the ac<hy>
count name to define the home directory. If the -m option is not used, base_dir must exist.
-c comment Any text string. It is generally a short description of the role. This information is stored in the role's
/etc/passwd entry.
-d dir The home directory of the new role. It defaults to base_dir/account_name, where base_dir is the base directo<hy>
ry for new login home directories and account_name is the new role name.
-D Display the default values for group, base_dir, skel_dir, shell, inactive, expire and key=value pairs. When used
with the -g, -b, -f, or -K, options, the -D option sets the default values for the specified fields. The default values are:
group
other (GID of 1)
base_dir
/home
skel_dir
/etc/skel
<beginning of page>
shell
/bin/pfsh
inactive
0
expire
Null
auths
Null
profiles
Null
key=value (pairs defined in user_attr(4)
not present
-e expire Specify the expiration date for a role. After this date, no user is able to access this role. The expire option
argument is a date entered using one of the date formats included in the template file /etc/datemsk. See get<hy>
date(3C).
If the date format that you choose includes spaces, it must be quoted. For example, you can enter 10/6/90 or Octo<hy>
ber 6, 1990. A null value (" ") defeats the status of the expired date. This option is useful for creating temporary
roles.
-f inactive The maximum number of days allowed between uses of a role ID before that ID is declared invalid. Nor<hy>
mal values are positive integers. A value of 0 defeats the status.
-g group An existing group's integer ID or character-string name. Without the -D option, it defines the new role's
primary group membership and defaults to the default group. You can reset this default value by invoking roleadd
-D -g group.
-G group An existing group's integer ID or character-string name. It defines the new role's supplementary group
membership. Duplicates between group with the -g and -G options are ignored. No more than NGROUPS_MAX
groups can be specified.
-k skel_dir A directory that contains skeleton information (such as .profile) that can be copied into a new role's
home directory. This directory must already exist. The system provides the /etc/skel directory that can be used for
this purpose.
-K key=value A key=value pair to add to the role's attributes. Multiple -K options can be used to add multiple
key=value pairs. The generic -K option with the appropriate key can be used instead of the specific implied key op<hy>
tions (-A and -P). See user_attr(4) for a list of valid key=value pairs. The "type" key is not a valid key for this op<hy>
tion. Keys can not be repeated.
-m Create the new role's home directory if it does not already exist. If the directory already exists, it must have read,
write, and execute permissions by group, where group is the role's primary group.
<beginning of page>
-o This option allows a UID to be duplicated (non-unique).
-P profile One or more comma-separated execution profiles defined in prof_attr(4).
-s shell Full pathname of the program used as the user's shell on login. It defaults to an empty field causing the sys<hy>
tem to use /bin/pfsh as the default. The value of shell must be a valid executable file.
-u uid The UID of the new role. This UID must be a non-negative decimal integer below MAXUID as defined in
<sys/param.h>. The UID defaults to the next available (unique) number above the highest number currently as<hy>
signed. For example, if UIDs 100, 105, and 200 are assigned, the next default UID number is 201. (UIDs from 0-99
are reserved for possible use in future applications.)

In case of an error, roleadd prints an error message and exits with a non-zero status.
The following indicates that login specified is already in use:
 UX: roleadd: ERROR: login is already in use. Choose another.
The following indicates that the uid specified with the -u option is not unique:
 UX: roleadd: ERROR: uid uid is already in use. Choose another.
The following indicates that the group specified with the -g option is already in use:
 UX: roleadd: ERROR: group group does not exist. Choose another.
The following indicates that the uid specified with the -u option is in the range of reserved UIDs (from 0-99):
 UX: roleadd: WARNING: uid uid is reserved.
<beginning of page>
The following indicates that the uid specified with the -u option exceeds MAXUID as defined in <sys/param.h>:
 UX: roleadd: ERROR: uid uid is too big. Choose another.
The following indicates that the /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow files do not exist:
 UX: roleadd: ERROR: Cannot update system files - login cannot be created.
If a network nameservice such as NIS or NIS+ is being used to supplement the local /etc/passwd file with additional
entries, roleadd cannot change information supplied by the network nameservice.
