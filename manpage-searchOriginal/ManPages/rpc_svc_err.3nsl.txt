rpc_svc_err, svcerr_auth, svcerr_decode, svcerr_noproc, svcerr_noprog, svcerr_progvers, svcerr_systemerr,
svcerr_weakauth <-> library routines for server side remote procedure call errors
These routines are part of the RPC library which allows C language programs to make procedure calls on other ma<hy>
chines across the network.
These routines can be called by the server side dispatch function if there is any error in the transaction with the
client.
See rpc(3NSL) for the definition of the SVCXPRT data structure.
 #include <rpc/rpc.h>
void svcerr_auth(const SVCXPRT *xprt, const enum auth_stat why);
Called by a service dispatch routine that refuses to perform a remote procedure call due to an authentication error.
void svcerr_decode(const SVCXPRT *xprt);
Called by a service dispatch routine that cannot successfully decode the remote parameters (see svc_getargs() in
rpc_svc_reg(3NSL)).
void svcerr_noproc(const SVCXPRT *xprt);
Called by a service dispatch routine that does not implement the procedure number that the caller requests.
void svcerr_noprog(const SVCXPRT *xprt);
Called when the desired program is not registered with the RPC package. Service implementors usually do not need
this routine.
void svcerr_progvers(const SVCXPRT *xprt, const rpcvers_t low_vers, const rpcvers_t high_vers);
Called when the desired version of a program is not registered with the RPC package. low_vers is the lowest version
number, and high_vers is the highest version number. Service implementors usually do not need this routine.
void svcerr_systemerr(const SVCXPRT *xprt);
Called by a service dispatch routine when it detects a system error not covered by any particular protocol. For exam<hy>
ple, if a service can no longer allocate storage, it may call this routine.
void svcerr_weakauth(const SVCXPRT *xprt);
Called by a service dispatch routine that refuses to perform a remote procedure call due to insufficient (but correct)
authentication parameters. The routine calls svcerr_auth(xprt, AUTH_TOOWEAK).
