/etc/nca/ncaport.conf
The ncaport.conf file is used to configure the IP addresses and ports that the Solaris Network Cache and Accelera<hy>
tion (NCA) kernel module services. The file contains two fields, key and value, in the format of ncaport=ipad<hy>
dress/port. IPv4 addresses must be in the dot notation d.d.d.d. IPv6 addresses must be in one of the three convention<hy>
al forms (see inet_pton(3SOCKET)). If an asterisk (*) is used for an IP address, it is interpreted as INADDR_ANY,
which matches any IP address.
A web server uses the environment variable LD_PRELOAD and the ncaport.conf configuration file to convert an
AF_INET socket to an AF_NCA socket. LD_PRELOAD enables the NCA socket utility library to be loaded be<hy>
fore libsocket.so.1. See the ncad_addr(4) for details. When a web server issues the bind(3SOCKET) system call, it
is intercepted by the interposition library ncad_addr.so. If the bind address is in the ncaport.conf file, the AF_IN<hy>
ET socket is converted to a AF_NCA socket. Example 1 Sample ncaport.conf File
The following is a sample ncaport.conf file:
 #
 # NCA Kernel Module Port Configuration File
 #
 ncaport=1080:0:0:0:8:800:200C:417A/100
 ncaport=192.168.84.71/80
 ncaport=*/9000
nca(1), bind(3SOCKET), inet_pton(3SOCKET), ncad_addr(4), attributes(5)
For those web servers that use AF_NCA sockets, the NCA port configuration described here has no effect.
NCA does not currently support IPv6. Any IPv6 addresses in the file ncaport.conf are ignored.
