The nisserver shell script can be used to set up a root master, non-root master, and replica NIS+ server with level 2
security (DES). If other authentication mechanisms are configured with nisauthconf(1M), nisserver will set up a
NIS+ server using those mechanisms. nisauthconf(1M) should be used before nisserver.
When setting up a new domain, this script creates the NIS+ directories (including groups_dir and org_dir) and sys<hy>
tem table objects for the domain specified. It does not populate the tables. nispopulate(1M) must be used to popu<hy>
late the tables.
-d NIS+_domain Specifies the name for the NIS+ domain. The default is your local domain.
-f Forces the NIS+ server setup without prompting for confirmation.
-g NIS+_groupname Specifies the NIS+ group name for the new domain. This option is not valid with -R option.
The default group is admin.<domain>.
-h NIS+_server_host Specifies the hostname for the NIS+ server. It must be a valid host in the local domain. Use a
fully qualified hostname (for example, hostx.xyz.sun.com.) to specify a host outside of your local domain. This op<hy>
tion is only used for setting up non-root master or replica servers. The default for non-root master server setup is to
use the same list of servers as the parent domain. The default for replica server setup is the local hostname.
-l network_password Specifies the network password with which to create the credentials for the root master server.
This option is only used for master root server setup (-r option). If this option is not specified, the script prompts you
for the login password.
-M Sets up the specified host as a master server. Make sure that rpc.nisd(1M) is running on the new master server
before this command is executed.
-R Sets up the specified host as a replica server. Make sure that rpc.nisd is running on the new replica server.
-r Sets up the server as a root master server. Use the -R option to set up a root replica server.
-v Runs the script in verbose mode.
-x Turns the echo mode on. The script just prints the commands that it would have executed. Note that the com<hy>
mands are not actually executed. The default is off.
-Y Sets up a NIS+ server with NIS-compatibility mode. The default is to set up the server without NIS-compatibility
mode.
Use the first synopsis of the command (-r) to set up a root master server. To run the command, you must be logged
in as super-user on the server machine.
<beginning of page>
Use the second synopsis of the command (-M) to set up a non-root master server for the specified domain. To run
the command, you must be logged in as a NIS+ principal on a NIS+ machine and have write permission to the par<hy>
ent directory of the domain that you are setting up. The new non-root master server machine must already be an
NIS+ client (see nisclient(1M)) and have the rpc.nisd(1M) daemon running.
Use the third synopsis of the command (-R) to set up a replica server for both root and non-root domains. To run the
command, you must be logged in as a NIS+ principal on a NIS+ machine and have write permission to the parent di<hy>
rectory of the domain that you are replicating. The new non-root replica server machine must already be an NIS+
client and have the rpc.nisd daemon running. Example 1 Setting up Servers
To set up a root master server for domain sun.com.:
 root_server# /usr/lib/nis/nisserver -r -d sun.com.
For the following examples make sure that the new servers are NIS+ clients and that rpc.nisd is running on these
hosts before executing nisserver. To set up a replica server for the sun.com. domain on host sunreplica:
 root_server# /usr/lib/nis/nisserver -R -d sun.com. -h sunrep
To set up a non-root master server for domain xyz.sun.com. on host sunxyz with the NIS+ groupname as admin-
mgr.xyz.sun.com.:
 root_server# /usr/lib/nis/nisserver -M -d xyz.sun.com. -h sunxyz \
 -g admin-mgr.xyz.sun.com.
To set up a non-root replica server for domain xyz.sun.com. on host sunabc:
 sunxyz# /usr/lib/nis/nisserver -R -d xyz.sun.com. -h sunabc

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris Operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
NIS+ to LDAP are available in the current Solaris release. For more information, visit http://www.sun.com/directo<hy>
