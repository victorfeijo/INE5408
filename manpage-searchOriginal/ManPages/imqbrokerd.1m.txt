imqbrokerd <-> start a Message Queue broker instance
/usr/bin/imqbrokerd [option...]
/usr/bin/imqbrokerd -h
imqbrokerd starts an instance of the Message Queue broker. The Message Queue broker is the main component of
a Message Queue message server. The broker performs reliable delivery of messages to and from Java Message Ser<hy>
vice (JMS) clients.
imqbrokerd uses command line options to specify broker configuration properties.
The following options are supported:
-backup fileName
Back up a Master Broker's configuration change record to fileName. This option only applies to broker clusters.
-cluster brokerList
Specify the list of broker instances which are connected in a cluster. This list is merged with the list in the imq.clus<hy>
ter.brokerlist property. This option only applies to broker clusters.
brokerList is a comma-separated list of broker instances, each specified by hostName:port (the host on which the
broker instance is running and the port number it is using) If you don't specify a value for hostName, localhost is
used. If you don't specify a value for port, the value of 7676 is used. For example: host1:8899,host2,:7878.
-dbpassword password
Specify the password for a plugged-in JDBC-compliant database used as a Message Queue data store.
-dbuser userName
Specify the user name for a plugged-in JDBC-compliant data store.
-Dproperty-=value
Set the specified broker configuration property to the value. The system does not validate either the configuration
property or value. Therefore, spelling, formatting, and case is important. Message Queue can not set incorrect values
passed using the -D option.
-force
Perform action without user confirmation. This option only applies when you use the -remove instance option,
which normally requires confirmation.
-h
Display usage help. Execute nothing else on the command line.
-javahome path
Specify the path to an alternate Java 2-compatible Java Development Kit (JDK) or Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
The default is to use the runtime bundled with the operating system.
-ldappassword password
Specify the password for accessing an LDAP user repository when using an LDAP server (as opposed to a built-in
flat-file repository) to authenticate users of a Message Queue message server.
<beginning of page>
-license [name]
Specify the license to load, if different from the default for your Message Queue product edition. If you don't speci<hy>
fy a license name, this lists all licenses installed on the system. Depending on the installed Message Queue edition,
the values for name are pe (Platform Edition-basic features), try (Platform Edition-90-day trial enterprise features),
and unl (Enterprise Edition).
-loglevel level
Specify the logging level. Valid values for level are NONE, ERROR, WARNING, or INFO. The default value is
INFO.
-metrics int
Report metrics at a specific interval. Specify int as the number of seconds.
-name brokerName
Specify the instance name of this broker and use the corresponding instance configuration file. If you do not specify
a broker name, the name of the file is set to imqbroker. If you run more than one instance of a broker on the same
host, each must have a unique name.
-passfile filename
Specify the name of the file from which to read the passwords for the SSL keystore, LDAP user repository, or JD<hy>
BC-compliant database.
-password keypassword
Specify the password for the SSL certificate keystore.
-port number
Specify the broker's Port Mapper port number. By default, this is set to 7676. To run two instances of a broker on the
same server, each broker's Port Mapper must have a different port number. JMS clients connect to the broker in<hy>
stance using this port number.
-remove instance
Remove the broker instance. Delete the instance configuration file, log files, data store, and other files and directories
associated with the broker instance. This option requires user confirmation unless you also specify the -force option.
-reset store|messages|durables|props
Reset the data store (or a subset of the store) or resets the configuration properties of the broker instance when the
broker instance is started. The action depends on the argument provided.
store Clear all persistent data in the data store, including messages, durable subscriptions, and transaction informa<hy>
tion store.
messages Clear all persistent messages durable.
durables Clear all durable subscriptions.
props Clear all configuration information in the config.props instance configuration file. All properties assume de<hy>
fault values.

-restore filename
Replace the Master Broker's configuration change record with the specified backup file. This file must have been
previously created using the -backup option. This option only applies to broker clusters.
-shared
Specify that the jms connection service be implemented using the shared threadpool model, in which threads are
shared among connections to increase the number of connections supported by a broker instance.
-silent
Turn off logging to the console.
-tty
Display all messages be to the console. WARNING and ERROR level messages are displayed on the console by
default.
-upgrade-store-nobackup
Specify that an earlier, incompatible version Message Queue data store is automatically removed when migrating to
Message Queue 3.5 format.
If you do not use this option, you must manually delete the earlier data store. This applies to both built-in (flat-file)
persistence and plugged-in (JDBC-compliant) persistence. Migration of the earlier data store to a Message Queue
3.5 data store takes place the first time you start a Message Queue 3.5 broker instance on an earlier version data
store.
-version
Display the version number of the installed product.
-vmargs are [[arg]...]
 Specify arguments to pass to the Java VM. Separate arguments with spaces. If you want to pass more than one argu<hy>
ment or if an argument contains a space, use enclosing quotation marks. For example:
 imqbrokerd -tty -vmargs " -Xmx128m -Xincgc"
 The following environment variables affect the execution of this command:
IMQ_JAVAHOME Specify the Java 2 compatible runtime. When this environment variable is not set it defaults to
/usr/j2se.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred.

Shell script for starting imqbrokerd. This file looks at the /etc/imq/imqbrokerd.conf file.
<beginning of page>
/etc/imq/imqbrokerd.conf
Configuration file which controls the behavior of the broker startup script.
/etc/imq/passwd
 Flat file user repository for authenticating users.
/etc/imq/accesscontrol.properties
