ntfsfix <-> fix common errors and force operating system to check NTFS
ntfsfix [options] device
The ntfsfix utility fixes some common NTFS problems. Note that it is not a version of chkdsk. It repairs some fun<hy>
damental NTFS inconsistencies, resets the NTFS journal file, and schedules an NTFS consistency check for the next
reboot of the operating system.
Run ntfsfix on an NTFS volume if you think it was damaged by the operating system or in some other way and it
cannot be mounted.
