readfile, longline <-> reads file, gets longest line
readfile filename
longline [filename]
The readfile function reads filename and copies it to stdout. No translation of NEWLINE is done. It keeps track of
the longest line it reads and if there is a subsequent call to longline, the length of that line, including the NEWLINE
character, is returned.
The longline function returns the length, including the NEWLINE character, of the longest line in filename. If file<hy>
name is not specified, it uses the file named in the last call to readfile. Example 1 Typical use of readfile and long<hy>
line
Here is a typical use of readfile and longline in a text frame definition file:
  .
  .
  .
 text="`readfile myfile`"
 columns=`longline`
  .

If filename does not exist, readfile will return FALSE (that is, the expression will have an error return).
longline returns 0 if a readfile has not previously been issued.
More than one descriptor can call readfile in the same frame definition file. In text frames, if one of those calls is
made from the text descriptor, then a subsequent use of longline will always get the longest line of the file read by
the readfile associated with the text descriptor, even if it was not the most recent use of readfile.
