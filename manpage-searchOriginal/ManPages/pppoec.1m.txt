pppoec <-> PPPoE chat utility
pppoec [-omillisecs] [-smillisecs] [-v] device
 [service [ [except]server... [only]]]
pppoec [-omillisecs] [-v] -i [device]
The pppoec utility implements the client-side negotiation of PPPoE. It is intended to be used with the pppd(1M)
connect option, in the same manner as the chat(1M) utility is used for asynchronous dial-up PPP.
When given with the -i flag, pppoec sends out a broadcast query on the given interface named by the device parame<hy>
ter. You can specify no other arguments in this mode. All responding PPPoE servers and the offered services are dis<hy>
played on standard output.
Otherwise, when given without the -i flag, pppoec does the full PPPoE client-side negotiation. The device parameter
is the intended Ethernet interface, and must already be plumbed with sppptun(1M). The optional service parameter
specifies a particular service desired; other offered services will be ignored. The optional server parameter specifies
a specific server desired. You can specify server as an Ethernet address in the usual x:x:x:x:x:x format (with "*" in
any of the six byte positions interpreted to mean "any"), or as a symbolic name resolved through /etc/ethers (or
NIS), or as a PPPoE access concentrator name. The sense of the match (true or false) can be inverted by specifying
the keyword except before this string. This parameter can be specified more than once, and the first match is taken.
If you specify the server parameter, then the selected servers become "preferred." If no preferred server responds,
then the first responding server is used instead. To exclude non-matching servers entirely, append the keyword only.
The following options are supported:
-i Sends out broadcast query over interface specified by device.
-o Sets the initial wait time in milliseconds for PADO from the server before PADI is retried. The default is 500 mil<hy>
liseconds for normal operation, or 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds) for inquiry (-i) mode.
-s Sets the initial wait time in milliseconds for PADS from the server before PADR is retried. The default is 2000
milliseconds (2 seconds).
-v Displays verbose progress messages, including all PPPoE messages sent, and all state machine transitions.
You normally do not need to adjust the parameters set with -o and -s. They are provided for coping with unusually
slow servers.
The following operands are supported:
device plumbed Ethernet interface
server preferred server or, if you specify only, the specified server
service desired service; other available services are ignored
Example 1 Connecting to Any Service on hme0
The following command enables you to connect to any PPPoE service on hme0:
 # /usr/bin/pppd sppptun plugin pppoe.so connect "/usr/lib/inet/pppoec hme0" debug
Often, a command such as the preceding is specified in an /etc/ppp/peers file instead. For example, enter the follow<hy>
ing in /etc/ppp/peers/myisp:
<beginning of page>
 sppptun
 plugin pppoe.so
 connect "/usr/lib/inet/pppoec hme0"
 debug
To invoke the PPP connection described in the file, enter:
 % /usr/bin/pppd call myisp
Note that, because the /etc/ppp/peers files are considered privileged by pppd, you need not be root to invoke the
preceding command.
Example 2 Connecting to a Particular Service
A more complex example: on hme0, connect to only the internet service offered by PPPoE servers with access con<hy>
centrator name isp, but not to any Ethernet addresses starting with 40:0:1a.
 # /usr/lib/inet/pppoec hme0 internet except 40:0:1a:*:*:* isp only
Note that the except 40:0:1a:*:*:* filter must come before isp, because the filters are first-match.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred.

Error messages are written to standard error, which is normally redirected by pppd to /etc/ppp/connect-errors. The
errors can also be redirected to pppd's standard output by using the updetach option.
If you specify the -v, verbose progress messages are displayed, including all PPPoE messages sent, and all state ma<hy>
chine transitions. Specifying the updetach or nodetach pppd option is helpful when using verbose mode.
