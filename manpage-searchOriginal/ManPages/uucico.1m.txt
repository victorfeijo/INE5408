uucico <-> file transport program for the uucp system
/usr/lib/uucp/uucico [-f] [-c type] [-d spool-directory]
 [-i interface] [-r role-number] [-s system-name]
 [-x debug-level]
uucico is the file transport program for uucp work file transfers.
The following options are supported:
-f This option is used to "force execution" of uucico by ignoring the limit on the maximum number of uucicos de<hy>
fined in the /etc/uucp/Limits file.
-c type The first field in the Devices file is the "Type" field. The -c option forces uucico to only use entries in the
"Type" field that match the user specified type. The specified type is usually the name of a local area network.
-d spool-directory This option specifies the directory spool-directory that contains the uucp work files to be trans<hy>
ferred. The default spool directory is /var/spool/uucp.
-i interface This option defines the interface used with uucico. The interface only affects slave mode. Known inter<hy>
faces are UNIX (default), TLI (basic Transport Layer Interface), and TLIS (Transport Layer Interface with Streams
modules, read/write).
-r role-number The role-number 1 is used for master mode. role-number 0 is used for slave mode (default). When
uucico is started by a program or cron, role-number 1 should be used for master mode.
-s system-name The -s option defines the remote system (system-name) that uucico will try to contact. It is required
when the role is master; system-name must be defined in the Systems file.
-x debug-level Both uux and uucp queue jobs that will be transferred by uucico. These jobs are normally started by
the uusched scheduler, for debugging purposes, and can be started manually. For example, the shell Uutry starts uu<hy>
cico with debugging turned on. The debug-level is a number between 0 and 9. Higher numbers give more detailed
debugging information.
