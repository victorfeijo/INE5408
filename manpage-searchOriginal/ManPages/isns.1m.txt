isns <-> Internet Storage Name Service
/usr/sbin/isns
The Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) provides consolidated discovery services for Internet SCSI (iSCSI) and
Internet Fibre Channel Protocol (iFCP) devices in an IP network. iSNS uses a client/server mechanism: servers
store configuration information for clients, and provide that information upon a client's request. IETF RFC 4171
describes the protocols between the server and client.
This man page provides a summary of the Solaris iSNS server implementation. The current implementation does not
support iFCP devices.
Solaris iSNS server is implemented as the daemon isns, which binds to the well -known port 3205 to service client
requests. The daemon is started by the service management facility (smf(5)), using the fault management resource
identifier (FMRI):
 svc:/network/isns_server
Use svcadm(1M) to enable isns. Enabling the service means that it starts and runs automatically whenever the oper<hy>
ating system is booted. The state of service can be displayed with the svcs(1) command.
The service properties listed below can be managed using svccfg(1M). The default value is assigned per RFC 4171
and implementation choice.
data_store_location
Configuration data store location. The default location is /etc/isns/isnsdata.xml.
ESI_retry_threshold_count
Entity Status Inquiry retry threshold counter. The default count is 3.
Management_SCNs_Enabled
Boolean that determines whether Management State Change Notification is enabled. The default is yes.
Authorized_Control_Nodes
Control node names.
After changing a property value, you must use svcadm(1M) refresh to enable isns to recognize the new value. If
you change the data_store_location property, you must enter a svcadm restart command for the change to take ef<hy>
fect.
RFC 4171 defines the default discovery domain, the default domain set, and the "Default DD/DDS" setting with the
intent of managing clients that have not been assigned to any user-defined discovery domain. The server adopts the
following behaviors with respect to the default discovery domain and domain set: <bu> An unassigned client is added to
the default discovery domain. A newly registered client or a client that was removed from its last discovery domain
membership is considered to be an unassigned client. <bu> When a client gets assigned to a user-defined discovery do<hy>
main, the server will remove the client from the default discovery domain. <bu> The default discovery domain set is al<hy>
lowed to be administratively activated or deactivated in order to let the administrator control discovery among clients
in the default discovery domain. <bu> It is not allowed to administratively add a client to the default discovery domain,
nor to administratively add a user-defined discovery domain to the default discovery domain set. <bu> The default state
of the Default discovery domain set is inactive.
The isns server supports certain rbac(5) authorizations that allow you to administer isns activity. These authoriza<hy>
tions include the following auth_attr(4) privileges:
solaris.isnsmgr.write
Required to create a discovery domain or domain set, to enable/disable a discovery domain set and to change group<hy>
ing of iSNS clients in a discovery domain or grouping of discovery domains in a discovery domain set.
<beginning of page>
solaris.smf.manage.isns
Required to manage the isns server through the smf(5).
solaris.smf.value.isns
Required to change the SMF service properties associated with isns.
The iSNS Server Management profile (see prof_attr(4)) includes all of the preceding authorizations. See rbac(5)
for an overview of roles and authorizations.
There are no options supported by the isns daemon. Example 1 Starting an isns Server
The following command starts the isns server.
 # svcadm enable svc:/network/isns_server
Example 2 Stopping an isns Server
The following command stops the isns server.
 # svcadm disable svc:/network/isns_server
Example 3 Changing an isns Property
The following sequence of commands changes the value of the ESI_retry_threshold_count property.
 # svccfg -s svc:/network/isns_server setprop \
 config/ESI_retry_threshold_count = 6
 # svcadm refresh svc:/network/isns_server

It is strongly recommended that you restart the server (svcadm restart) after a service property is changed. This al<hy>
lows the server to apply a uniform setting for existing and new clients.
A control node, as described in RFC 4171, is not required to administer the server. Control node operations can be
achieved through the isnsadm(1M) command interface on the local host. For example, isnsadm enables you to cre<hy>
ate a discovery domain and a discovery domain set and to add a member to it, in order to create discovery domain
and discovery domain set associations.
