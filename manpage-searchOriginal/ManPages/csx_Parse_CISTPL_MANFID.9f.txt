int32_t csx_Parse_CISTPL_MANFID(client_handle_t ch, tuple_t *tu,
 cistpl_manfid_t *cm);
Solaris DDI Specific (Solaris DDI)
ch Client handle returned from csx_RegisterClient(9F).
tu Pointer to a tuple_t structure (see tuple(9S)) returned by a call to csx_GetFirstTuple(9F) or csx_GetNext<hy>
Tuple(9F).
cm Pointer to a cistpl_manfid_t structure which contains the parsed CISTPL_MANFID tuple information upon re<hy>
turn from this function.
This function parses the Manufacturer Identification tuple, CISTPL_MANFID, into a form usable by PC Card driv<hy>
ers.
The CISTPL_MANFID tuple is used to describe the information about the manufacturer of a PC Card. There are
two types of information, the PC Card's manufacturer and a manufacturer card number.
The structure members of cistpl_manfid_t are:
 uint32_t manf; /* PCMCIA assigned manufacturer code */
 uint32_t card; /* manufacturer information
  (part number and/or revision) */
CS_SUCCESS Successful operation.
CS_BAD_HANDLE Client handle is invalid.
CS_UNKNOWN_TUPLE Parser does not know how to parse tuple.
CS_NO_CARD No PC Card in socket.
CS_NO_CIS No Card Information Structure (CIS) on PC card.
CS_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION No PCMCIA hardware installed.
This function may be called from user or kernel context.
