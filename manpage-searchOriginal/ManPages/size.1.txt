size <-> print section sizes in bytes of object files
size [-f] [-F] [-n] [-o] [-V] [-x] filename...
The size command produces segment or section size information in bytes for each loaded section in ELF object files.
size prints out the size of the text, data, and bss (uninitialized data) segments (or sections) and their total.
size processes ELF object files entered on the command line. If an archive file is input to the size command, the in<hy>
formation for each object file in the archive is displayed.
When calculating segment information, the size command prints out the total file size of the non-writable segments,
the total file size of the writable segments, and the total memory size of the writable segments minus the total file
size of the writable segments.
If it cannot calculate segment information, size calculates section information. When calculating section informa<hy>
tion, it prints out the total size of sections that are allocatable, non-writable, and not NOBITS, the total size of the
sections that are allocatable, writable, and not NOBITS, and the total size of the writable sections of type NOBITS.
NOBITS sections do not actually take up space in the filename.
If size cannot calculate either segment or section information, it prints an error message and stops processing the
file.
The following options are supported:
-f Prints out the size of each allocatable section, the name of the section, and the total of the section sizes. If there is
no section data, size prints out an error message and stops processing the file.
-F Prints out the size of each loadable segment, the permission flags of the segment, then the total of the loadable
segment sizes. If there is no segment data, size prints an error message and stops processing the file.
-n Prints out non-loadable segment or non-allocatable section sizes. If segment data exists, size prints out the memo<hy>
ry size of each loadable segment or file size of each non-loadable segment, the permission flags, and the total size of
the segments. If there is no segment data, size prints out, for each allocatable and non-allocatable section, the memo<hy>
ry size, the section name, and the total size of the sections. If there is no segment or section data, size prints an error
message and stops processing.
-o Prints numbers in octal, not decimal.
-V Prints the version information for the size command on the standard error output.
-x Prints numbers in hexadecimal, not decimal.
The examples below are typical size output. Example 1 Producing size information
 example% size filename
 2724 + 88 + 0 = 2812
Example 2 Producing allocatable section size information
 example% size -f filename
 26(.text) + 5(.init) + 5(.fini) = 36
Example 3 Producing loadable segment size information
 example% size -F filename
 2724(r-x) + 88(rwx) + 0(rwx) = 2812 ... (If statically linked)

Since the size of bss sections is not known until link-edit time, the size command will not give the true total size of
pre-linked objects.
