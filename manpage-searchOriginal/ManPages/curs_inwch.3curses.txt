chtype inwch(void);
chtype winwch(WINDOW *win);
chtype mvinwch(int y, int x);
chtype mvwinwch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);
These routines return the wchar_t character, of type chtype, at the current position in the named window. If any at<hy>
tributes are set for that position, their values are OR-ed into the value returned. Constants defined in <curses.h> can
be used with the logical AND (&) operator to extract the character or attributes alone.
The following bit-masks may be AND-ed with characters returned by winwch().
 A_WCHARTEXT Bit-mask to extract character
 A_WATTRIBUTES Bit-mask to extract attributes
See attributes(5) for descriptions of the following attributes:
tab() box; cw(2.75i) |cw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) |lw(2.75i) ATTRIBUTE TYPEATTRIBUTE VALUE _ MT-LevelUnsafe

The header file <curses.h> automatically includes the header files <stdio.h>, <unctrl.h> and <widec.h>.
Note that all of these routines may be macros.
None of these routines can use the color attribute in chtype.
