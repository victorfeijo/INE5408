net_phylookup <-> determine if a network interface name exists for a network protocol
#include <sys/neti.h>
phy_if_t net_phylookup(const net_data_t net, const char *name);
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
net value returned from a successful call to net_protocol_lookup(9F).
name name of the network interface to find.
The net_phylookup() function attempts to resolve the interface name passed in with the network protocol.
When called successfully, the value returned represents a network interface that exists, at the time of the call, within
the scope of the network interface. This value is only guaranteed to be unique for a name within the scope of the net<hy>
work protocol.
The net_phylookup() function returns -1 if it is not supported by the network protocol, and 0 if the named network
interface does not exist (or is otherwise unknown). Otherwise, it returns a value greater than 0 representing a net<hy>
work interface that currently exists within the scope of this network protocol.
The net_phylookup() function may be called from user, kernel, or interrupt context.
