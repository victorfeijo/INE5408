/sbin/installgrub [-fm] stage1 stage2 raw-device
The installgrub command is an x86-only program. GRUB stands for GRand Unified Bootloader.
installgrub installs GRUB stage 1 and stage 2 files on the boot area of a disk partition. If you specify the -m option,
installgrub installs the stage 1 file on the master boot sector of the disk.
The installgrub command accepts the following options:
-f Suppresses interaction when overwriting the master boot sector.
-m Installs GRUB stage1 on the master boot sector interactively. You must use this option if Solaris is installed on
an extended partition.
The installgrub command accepts the following operands:
stage1 The name of the GRUB stage 1 file.
stage2 The name of the GRUB stage 2 file.
raw-device The name of the device onto which GRUB code is to be installed. It must be a character device that is
readable and writable. For disk devices, specify the slice where the GRUB menu file is located. (For Solaris it is the
root slice.) For a floppy disk, it is /dev/rdiskette.
Example 1 Installing GRUB on a Hard Disk Slice
The following command installs GRUB on a system where the root slice is c0d0s0:
 example# /sbin/installgrub /boot/grub/stage1 \
  /boot/grub/stage2 /dev/rdsk/c0d0s0
Example 2 Installing GRUB on a Floppy
The following command installs GRUB on a formatted floppy:
 example# mount -F pcfs /dev/diskette /mnt
 # mkdir -p /mnt/boot/grub
 # cp /boot/grub/* /mnt/boot/grub
 # umount /mnt
 # cd /boot/grub
 # /sbin/installgrub stage1 stage2 /dev/rdiskette
/boot/grub Directory where GRUB files reside.

Installing GRUB on the master boot sector (-m option) overrides any boot manager currently installed on the ma<hy>
chine. The system will always boot the GRUB in the Solaris partition regardless of which fdisk partition is active.
