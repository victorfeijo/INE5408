in.daytimed <-> UDP or TCP daytime protocol service daemon
in.daytimed
FMRI svc:/internet/daytime:default
FMRI stands for Fault Management Resource Identifier. It is used to identify resources managed by the Fault Man<hy>
ager. See fmd(1M) and smf(5).
The in.daytimed service provides the server-side of the daytime protocol. This protocol is used for debugging and
bandwidth measurement and is available on both TCP and UDP transports, through port 13.
The in.daytimed service is an inetd(1M) smf(5) delegated service. The in.daytimed detects which transport is re<hy>
quested by examining the socket it is passed by the inetd daemon.
TCP-based service Once a connection is established, the in.daytimed generates the current date and time in
ctime(3C) format as 7-bit ASCII and sends it through the connection. The server then closes the connection. Any
data received from the client side of the connection is discarded.
UDP-based service The in.daytimed listens for UDP datagrams. When a datagram is received, the server generates
the current date and time in ctime(3C) format as 7-bit ASCII and inserts it in a UDP datagram sent in response to
the client's request. Any received data is ignored.
