nischown <-> change the owner of a NIS+ object
nischown [-AfLP] owner name...
nischown changes the owner of the NIS+ objects or entries specified by name to owner. Entries are specified using
indexed names (see nismatch(1)). If owner is not a fully qualified NIS+ principal name (see nisaddcred(1M)), the
default domain (see nisdefaults(1)) will be appended to it.
The only restriction on changing an object's owner is that you must have modify permissions for the object. Note: If
you are the current owner of an object and you change ownership, you may not be able to regain ownership unless
you have modify access to the new object.
The command will fail if the master NIS+ server is not running.
The NIS+ server will check the validity of the name before making the modification.
The following options are supported:
-A Modify all entries in all tables in the concatenation path that match the search criteria specified in name. It im<hy>
plies the -P option.
-f Force the operation and fail silently if it does not succeed.
-L Follow links and change the owner of the linked object or entries rather than the owner of the link itself.
-P Follow the concatenation path within a named table. This option is only meaningful when either name is an in<hy>
dexed name or the -L option is also specified and the named object is a link pointing to entries.
Example 1 Using the nischown Command
The following two examples show how to change the owner of an object to a principal in a different domain, and to
change it to a principal in the local domain, respectively.
 example% nischown bob.remote.domain. object
 example% nischown skippy object
The next example shows how to change the owner of an entry in the passwd table.
 example% nischown bob.remote.domain. '[uid=99],passwd.org_dir'
This example shows how to change the object or entries pointed to by a link.
 example% nischown -L skippy linkname
NIS_PATH If this variable is set, and the NIS+ name is not fully qualified, each directory specified will be searched
until the object is found (see nisdefaults(1)).
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful operation.

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
NIS+ to LDAP are available in the current Solaris release. For more information, visit http://www.sun.com/directo<hy>
