int mlib_ImageTestFlags(const mlib_image *img, mlib_s32 flags);
The mlib_ImageTestFlags() function tests the flags for a combination of the following predefined characteristics.
Note that the result of zero means the conditions are satisfied.
 MLIB_IMAGE_ALIGNED64 /* data address is 64-byte aligned */
 MLIB_IMAGE_ALIGNED8 /* data address is 8-byte aligned */
 MLIB_IMAGE_ALIGNED4 /* data address is 4-byte aligned */
 MLIB_IMAGE_ALIGNED2 /* data address is 2-byte aligned */
 MLIB_IMAGE_WIDTH8X /* width is multiple of 8 */
 MLIB_IMAGE_WIDTH4X /* width is multiple of 4 */
 MLIB_IMAGE_WIDTH2X /* width is multiple of 2 */
 MLIB_IMAGE_HEIGHT8X /* height is multiple of 8 */
 MLIB_IMAGE_HEIGHT4X /* height is multiple of 4 */
 MLIB_IMAGE_HEIGHT2X /* height is multiple of 2 */
 MLIB_IMAGE_STRIDE8X /* stride is multiple of 8 */
 MLIB_IMAGE_ONEVECTOR /* stride is equal to width in bytes */
 MLIB_IMAGE_USERALLOCATED /* data space has been allocated by user */
 MLIB_IMAGE_ATTRIBUTESET /* image attribute flags have been set */
The function takes the following arguments:
img Pointer to a mediaLib image structure.
flags Combination of a set of characteristics to be tested. It is formed by logically Oring one or more individual pre<hy>
defined characteristics.
The function returns an integer value containing results of test. Condition = 0 if satisfied; otherwise, Condition != 0.
