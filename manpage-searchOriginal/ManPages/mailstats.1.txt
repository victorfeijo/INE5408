mailstats <-> print statistics collected by sendmail
mailstats [-o] [-c ] [-C configfile] [-f statisticsfile]
 [-p] [-P]
The mailstats utility prints out the statistics collected by the sendmail(1M) program on mailer usage. These statis<hy>
tics are collected if the file indicated by the StatusFile configuration option of sendmail (defined in /etc/mail/send<hy>
mail.cf) exists. The default statistics file is /etc/mail/statistics.
To enable mailstats, you must, as root, touch /etc/mail/statistics. See the StatusFile processing option in send<hy>
mail(1M).
mailstats first prints the time that the statistics file was created and the last time it was modified. Then, the statistics
for each mailer are displayed on a single line, each with the following whitespace-separated fields:
M The mailer number.
msgsfr Number of messages from the mailer.
bytes_from Kbytes from the mailer.
msgsto Number of messages to the mailer.
bytes_to Kbytes to the mailer.
msgsrej Number of messages rejected by the mailer.
msgsdis Number of messages discarded by the mailer.
msgsqur Number of messages quarantined by the mailer.
Mailer The name of the mailer.
The display of statistics described above is followed by a separation line containing only equal sign (=) characters.
After the separation line, a line preceded with a "T" and totaling the values for all of the mailers is displayed. This is
followed by another line preceded with a "C" that lists the number of TCP connections.
To reinitialize the statistics file once a night, add an entry to root's crontab(1):
 mailstats -p > /dev/null
The following options are supported:
-c Try to use submit.cf instead of the default sendmail configuration file.
-C configfile Specify a sendmail configuration file.
-f statisticsfile Specify a sendmail statistics file.
-o Do not display the name of the mailer in the output.
<beginning of page>
-p Output information in program-readable mode and clear statistics.
-P Output information in program-readable mode without clearing statistics.
See largefile(5) for the description of the behavior of mailstats when encountering files greater than or equal to 2
Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes).
