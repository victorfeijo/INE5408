split <-> split a file into pieces
split [-linecount | -l linecount] [-a suffixlength]
 [file [name]]
split [-b n | nk | nm] [-a suffixlength] [file [name]]
The split utility reads file and writes it in linecount-line pieces into a set of output-files. The name of the first output-
file is name with aa appended, and so on lexicographically, up to zz (a maximum of 676 files). The maximum length
of name is 2 characters less than the maximum filename length allowed by the filesystem. See statvfs(2). If no out<hy>
put name is given, x is used as the default (output-files will be called xaa, xab, and so forth).
The following options are supported:
<mi>linecount | -l linecount
Number of lines in each piece. Defaults to 1000 lines.
-a suffixlength
Uses suffixlength letters to form the suffix portion of the filenames of the split file. If -a is not specified, the default
suffix length is 2. If the sum of the name operand and the suffixlength option-argument would create a filename ex<hy>
ceeding NAME_MAX bytes, an error will result; split will exit with a diagnostic message and no files will be created.
-b n
Splits a file into pieces n bytes in size.
-b nk
Splits a file into pieces n*1024 bytes in size.
-b nm
Splits a file into pieces n*1048576 bytes in size.
The following operands are supported:
file The path name of the ordinary file to be split. If no input file is given or file is <mi>, the standard input will be used.
name The prefix to be used for each of the files resulting from the split operation. If no name argument is given, x
will be used as the prefix of the output files. The combined length of the basename of prefix and suffixlength cannot
exceed NAME_MAX bytes. See OPTIONS.
See largefile(5) for the description of the behavior of split when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte (
2^31 bytes).
See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of split: LANG,
LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred.
