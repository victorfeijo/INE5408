The plockstat utility gathers and displays user-level locking statistics. By default, plockstat monitors all lock con<hy>
tention events, gathers frequency and timing data about those events, and displays the data in decreasing frequency
order, so that the most common events appear first.
plockstat gathers data until the specified command completes or the process specified with the -p option completes.
plockstat relies on DTrace to instrument a running process or a command it invokes to trace events of interest. This
imposes a small but measurable performance overhead on the processes being observed. Users must have the
dtrace_proc privilege and have permission to observe a particular process with plockstat. Refer to the for more in<hy>
formation about DTrace security features.
The following options are supported:
-A Watch all lock events. This option is equivalent to -CH.
-C Watch contention events.
-H Watch hold events.
-e secs Exit after the number of seconds specified have elapsed.
-n count Display only the specified number of entries for each output category.
-s depth Record a stack trace rather than just the calling function.
-p pid Specify a process ID from which plockstat is to gather data.
-v Print out a message to indicate that tracing has started.
-x arg[=val] Enable or modify a DTrace runtime option or D compiler option. The list of options is found in the So<hy>
laris Dynamic Tracing Guide. Boolean options are enabled by specifying their name. Options with values are set by
separating the option name and value with an equals sign (=).
-V Print the Dtrace commands used to gather the data. The output can then be used directly with the dtrace(1M)
command.
The following operands are supported:
arg A string to be passed as an argument to command.
command The name of a utility to be invoked.
count A positive integer value.
<beginning of page>
pid A process identifier for a process to be monitored.
secs Duration specified as a positive integer number of seconds.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred.
