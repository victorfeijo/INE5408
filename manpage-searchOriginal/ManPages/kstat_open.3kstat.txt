kstat_ctl_t *kstat_open(void);
int kstat_close(kstat_ctl_t *kc);
The kstat_open() function initializes a kstat control structure that provides access to the kernel statistics library. It
returns a pointer to this structure, which must be supplied as the kc argument in subsequent libkstat function calls.
The kstat_close() function frees all resources that were associated with kc. This is performed automatically on ex<hy>
it(2) and execve(2).
Upon successful completion, kstat_open() returns a pointer to a kstat control structure. Otherwise, it returns NULL,
no resources are allocated, and errno is set to indicate the error.
Upon successful completion, kstat_close() returns 0. Otherwise, <mi>1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
The kstat_open() function will fail if:
ENOMEM Insufficient storage space is available.
EAGAIN The kstat was temporarily unavailable for reading or writing.
ENXIO The given kstat could not be located for reading.
EOVERFLOW The data for the given kstat was too large to be stored in the structure.
The kstat_open() function can also return the error values for open(2).
The kstat_close() function can also return the error values for close(2).
