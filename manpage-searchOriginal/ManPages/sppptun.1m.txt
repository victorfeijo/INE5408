sppptun <-> PPP tunneling driver utility
sppptun plumb
sppptun plumb [-s sap] protocol device
sppptun unplumb interface
sppptun query
The sppptun utility is used to configure and query the Solaris PPP tunneling device driver, /dev/sppptun. Currently,
only PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) is supported, so the plumb and unplumb arguments are used to specify Ethernet
interfaces that are to be used for PPPoE, and the query option lists the plumbed interfaces.
The use of sppptun to add interfaces is similar to the use of ifconfig(1M) to add interfaces to IP. The plumbing is
done once for each interface, preferably at system start-up time, and is not normally manipulated on a running sys<hy>
tem. If multiple instances of PPP are run over a single interface, they share the plumbing to that interface. Plumbing
for each session is not required (and not possible for PPPoE).
The proper way to plumb interfaces for PPPoE is to list the interfaces, one per line, in the /etc/ppp/pppoe.if file. If
alternate Ethertype (SAP) values are necessary, then include the PPPoE Session and Discovery Stage values as hexa<hy>
decimal on the same line. The line format is:
 interface [session [discovery]]
The defaults are the Ethertypes specified in RFC 2516, and most users should not need to set these values. See the
examples for one possible use.
sppptun plumb
When specified with no additional arguments, the plumb argument lists the protocols that are supported by the utili<hy>
ty. These are the strings that are used as the protocol argument below.
sppptun plumb [-s sap] protocol device
This plumbs a new interface into the driver. The protocol parameter is pppoe for the PPP-carrying "Session Stage"
connection or pppoed for the PPPoE "Discovery Stage" connection. Both connections must be present for each Eth<hy>
ernet interface that is to be used for PPPoE. The device parameter is the path name of the Ethernet interface to use
(use ifconfig(1M) to list available devices). If the path begins with /dev/, then this portion may be omitted.
The -s sap option can be specified to use an alternate Ethertype (SAP) for the selected protocol. The sap value must
be given in hexadecimal. Some access servers use Ethertypes for PPPoE different from those in RFC 2516. The de<hy>
faults are 8864 for pppoe and 8863 for pppoed.
sppptun unplumb interface
This removes an existing interface from the driver and terminates any PPP sessions that were using the interface.
The interface parameter is the name of the interface as reported when the interface was plumbed.
sppptun query
Displays the canonical names of all interfaces plumbed into the /dev/sppptun device driver.
Example 1 Setting up to Use PPPoE on hme0
Plumb the hme0 interface.
 # sppptun plumb pppoed hme0
 hme0:pppoed
 # sppptun plumb pppoe hme0
 hme0:pppoe
<beginning of page>
Remove the hme0 interface.
 # sppptun unplumb hme0:pppoed
 # sppptun unplumb hme0:pppoe
Example 2 Script to Remove All Plumbed Interfaces
 #!/bin/sh
 for intf in `sppptun query`
 do
  sppptun unplumb $intf
 done
Example 3 Interoperating with 3COM HomeConnect Dual Link ADSL
 # dladm show-link
 LINK CLASS MTU STATE OVER
 nge0 phys 1500 up --
 # echo nge0 3c13 3c12 > /etc/ppp/pppoe.if
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
1 One or more errors occurred.
