WINDOW *derwin(WINDOW *orig, int nlines, int ncols,
 int begin_y, int begin_x);
WINDOW *newwin(int nlines, int ncols, int begin_y, int begin_x);
WINDOW *subwin(WINDOW *orig, int nlines, int ncols, int begin_y,
 int begin_x);
The derwin() function creates a subwindow within window orig, with the specified number of lines and columns,
and upper left corner positioned at begin_x, begin_y relative to window orig. A pointer to the new window structure
is returned.
The newwin() function creates a new window with the specified number of lines and columns and upper left corner
positioned at begin_x, begin_y. A pointer to the new window structure is returned. A full-screen window can be
created by calling newwin(0,0,0,0).
If the number of lines specified is zero, newwin() uses a default value of LINES minus begin_y; if the number of
columns specified is zero, newwin() uses the default value of COLS minus begin_x.
The subwin() function creates a subwindow within window orig, with the specified number of lines and columns,
and upper left corner positioned at begin_x, begin_y (relative to the physical screen, not to window orig). A pointer
to the new window structure is returned.
The original window and subwindow share character storage of the overlapping area (each window maintains its
own pointers, cursor location, and other items). This means that characters and attributes are identical in overlapping
areas regardless of which window characters are written to.
When using subwindows, it is often necessary to call touchwin(3XCURSES) before wrefresh(3XCURSES) to
maintain proper screen contents.
orig Is a pointer to the parent window for the newly created subwindow.
nlines Is the number of lines in the subwindow.
ncols Is the number of columns in the subwindow.
begin_y Is the y (row) coordinate of the upper left corner of the subwindow, relative to the parent window.
begin_x Is the x (column) coordinate of the upper left corner of the subwindow, relative to the parent window.
On success, these functions return a pointer to the newly-created window. Otherwise, they return ERR.
None.
