wc <-> display a count of lines, words and characters in a file
wc [-c | -m | -C] [-lw] [file]...
wc [-c | -m | -C] [-lLqw] [file]...
wc reads one or more input files and, by default, writes the number of NEWLINE characters, words and bytes con<hy>
tained in each input file to the standard output.
wc also writes a total count for all named files, if more than one input file is specified.
wc considers a word to be a non-zero-length string of characters delimited by white space (for example, SPACE,
TAB). See iswspace(3C) or isspace(3C).
The wc built-in in ksh93 is associated with the /bin and /usr/bin paths. It is invoked when wc is executed without a
pathname prefix and the pathname search finds a /bin/wc or /usr/bin/wc executable.
wc reads one or more input files and, by default, for each file writes a line containing the number of NEWLINEs,
words, and bytes contained in each file followed by the file name to standard output in that order. A word is defined
to be a non-zero length string delimited by isspace(3C) characters.
If more than one file is specified, wc writes a total count for all of the named files with total written instead of the file
name.
By default, wc writes all three counts. Options can specified so that only certain counts are written. The -c, -C, and
-m options are mutually exclusive.
If no file is specified, or if the file is -, wc reads from standard input and no filename is written to standard output.
The start of the file is defined as the current offset.
-c
--bytes | chars
List the byte counts.
-l
--lines
List the line counts.
-L
--longest-line | max-line-length
List the longest line length.
-m | C
--multibyte-chars
List the character counts.
-q
--quiet
Suppress invalid multi-byte character warnings.
-w
--words
List the word counts.
The following options are supported:
<beginning of page>
-c Counts bytes.
-C Same as -m.
-l Counts lines.
-m Counts characters.
-w Counts words delimited by white space characters or new line characters. Delimiting characters are Extended
Unix Code (EUC) characters from any code set defined by iswspace().
If no option is specified, the default is -lwc (counts lines, words, and bytes.)
The following operand is supported:
file A path name of an input file. If no file operands are specified, the standard input is used.
See largefile(5) for the description of the behavior of wc when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte (
2^31 bytes).
See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of wc: LANG,
LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred.
