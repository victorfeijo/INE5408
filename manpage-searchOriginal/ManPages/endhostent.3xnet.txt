The gethostent(), gethostbyaddr(), and gethostbyname() functions each return a pointer to a hostent structure, the
members of which contain the fields of an entry in the network host database.
The gethostent() function reads the next entry of the database, opening a connection to the database if necessary.
The gethostbyaddr() function searches the database and finds an entry which matches the address family specified
by the type argument and which matches the address pointed to by the addr argument, opening a connection to the
database if necessary. The addr argument is a pointer to the binary-format (that is, not null-terminated) address in
network byte order, whose length is specified by the len argument. The datatype of the address depends on the ad<hy>
dress family. For an address of type AF_INET, this is an in_addr structure, defined in <netinet/in.h>. For an ad<hy>
dress of type AF_INET6, there is an in6_addr structure defined in <netinet/in.h>.
The gethostbyname() function searches the database and finds an entry which matches the host name specified by
the name argument, opening a connection to the database if necessary. If name is an alias for a valid host name, the
function returns information about the host name to which the alias refers, and name is included in the list of alias<hy>
es returned.
The sethostent() function opens a connection to the network host database, and sets the position of the next entry to
the first entry. If the stayopen argument is non-zero, the connection to the host database will not be closed after each
call to gethostent() (either directly, or indirectly through one of the other gethost*() functions).
The endhostent() function closes the connection to the database.
The gethostent(), gethostbyaddr(), and gethostbyname() functions may return pointers to static data, which may
be overwritten by subsequent calls to any of these functions.
These functions are generally used with the Internet address family.
On successful completion, gethostbyaddr(), gethostbyname() and gethostent() return a pointer to a hostent struc<hy>
ture if the requested entry was found, and a null pointer if the end of the database was reached or the requested entry
was not found. Otherwise, a null pointer is returned.
On unsuccessful completion, gethostbyaddr() and gethostbyname() functions set h_errno to indicate the error.
No errors are defined for endhostent(), gethostent() and sethostent().
The gethostbyaddr() and gethostbyname() functions will fail in the following cases, setting h_errno to the value
shown in the list below. Any changes to errno are unspecified.
HOST_NOT_FOUND No such host is known.
NO_DATA The server recognised the request and the name but no address is available. Another type of request to
the name server for the domain might return an answer.
NO_RECOVERY An unexpected server failure occurred which can not be recovered.
<beginning of page>
TRY_AGAIN A temporary and possibly transient error occurred, such as a failure of a server to respond.
