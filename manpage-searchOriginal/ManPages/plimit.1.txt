plimit <-> get or set the resource limits of running processes
plimit [-km] pid...
plimit {-cdfnstv} soft,hard... pid...
If one or more of the cdfnstv options is specified, plimit sets the soft (current) limit and/or the hard (maximum) lim<hy>
it of the indicated resource(s) in the processes identified by the process-ID list, pid. Otherwise plimit reports the re<hy>
source limits of the processes identified by the process-ID list, pid.
Only the owner of a process or the super-user is permitted either to get or to set the resource limits of a process. On<hy>
ly the super-user can increase the hard limit.
The following options are supported:
-k On output, show file sizes in kilobytes (1024 bytes) rather than in 512-byte blocks.
-m On output, show file and memory sizes in megabytes (1024*1024 bytes).
The remainder of the options are used to change specified resource limits. They each accept an argument of the
form:
soft,hard
where soft specifies the soft (current) limit and hard specifies the hard (maximum) limit. If the hard limit is not spec<hy>
ified, the comma may be omitted. If the soft limit is an empty string, only the hard limit is set. Each limit is either
the literal string unlimited, or a number, with an optional scaling factor, as follows:
nk n kilobytes
nm n megabytes (minutes for CPU time)
nh n hours (for CPU time only)
mm:ss minutes and seconds (for CPU time only)
The soft limit cannot exceed the hard limit.
-c soft,hard Set core file size limits (default unit is 512-byte blocks).
-d soft,hard Set data segment (heap) size limits (default unit is kilobytes).
-f soft,hard Set file size limits (default unit is 512-byte blocks).
-n soft,hard Set file descriptor limits (no default unit).
-s soft,hard Set stack segment size limits (default unit is kilobytes).
-t soft,hard Set CPU time limits (default unit is seconds).
-v soft,hard Set virtual memory size limits (default unit is kilobytes).
The following operands are supported.
<beginning of page>
pid Process ID list.
plimit returns the exit value zero on success, non-zero on failure (such as no such process, permission denied, or in<hy>
valid option).
