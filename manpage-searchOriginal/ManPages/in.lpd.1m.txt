in.lpd <-> BSD print protocol adaptor
/usr/lib/print/in.lpd
in.lpd implements the network listening service for the BSD print protocol specified in RFC 1179. The BSD print
protocol provides a remote interface for systems to interact with a local spooling system. The protocol defines five
standard requests from the client to the server: starting queue processing, transferring print jobs, retrieving terse sta<hy>
tus, retrieving verbose status, and canceling print jobs.
The in.lpd service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/network/lp
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). Responsibility for initiating and restarting this service is delegated to inetd(1M). Use inetadm(1M) to
make configuration changes and to view configuration information for this service. The service's status can be
queried using the svcs(1) command.
in.lpd uses the config/log_from_remote property to allow or disallow remote access. The default value of this prop<hy>
erty, localhost, disallows remote access.
inetd waits for connections on TCP port 515. Upon receipt of a connect request, in.lpd is started to service the con<hy>
nection. Once the request has been filled, in.lpd closes the connection and exits. Example 1 Allowing Remote Ac<hy>
