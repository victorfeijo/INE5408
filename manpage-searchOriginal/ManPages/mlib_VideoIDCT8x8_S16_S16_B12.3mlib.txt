The mlib_VideoIDCT8x8_S16_S16_B12() function computes the inverse DCT (called IDCT) for the output IDCT
block of data type mlib_s16 and input DCT coefficients of data type mlib_s16. This function is not guaranteed to be
IEEE-1180-compliant. The output of the IDCT routine should be within the range of [-2048, 2047] if coeffs is ob<hy>
tained from the corresponding forward DCT function mlib_VideoDCT8x8_S16_S16_B12().
The source and destination buffer addresses must be 8-byte aligned.
This function can be used in JPEG with 12-bit precision.
For MPEG, the output, which is really the difference between the current block and the reference block, can occupy
nine bits and is represented as a 16-bit datum. The output must be added to the motion-compensated reference block
in order to reconstruct the current block.
Since mediaLib 2.5, mlib_VideoIDCT8x8_S16_S16() has been renamed to mlib_VideoIDCT8x8_S16_S16_B12().
Now mlib_VideoIDCT8x8_S16_S16() is an alias of mlib_VideoIDCT8x8_S16_S16_B12().
The function takes the following arguments:
block Pointer to an 8x8 block in the current frame or motion-compensated reference block. block must be 8-byte
aligned.
coeffs Pointer to the source DCT coefficients. coeffs must be 8-byte aligned.
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
