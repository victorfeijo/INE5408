rndc-confgen <-> rndc key generation tool
rndc-confgen [-ah] [-b keysize] [-c keyfile] [-k keyname]
 [-p port] [-r randomfile] [-s address] [-t chrootdir]
 [-u user]
The rndc-confgen utility generates configuration files for rndc(1M). This utility can be used as a convenient alter<hy>
native to writing by hand the rndc.conf(4) file and the corresponding controls and key statements in named.conf.
It can also be run with the -a option to set up a rndc.key file and avoid altogether the need for a rndc.conf file and a
controls statement.
The following options are supported:
-a Perform automatic rndc configuration. This option creates a file rndc.key in /etc (or however sysconfdir was
specified when BIND was built) that is read by both rndc and named(1M) on startup. The rndc.key file defines a
default command channel and authentication key allowing rndc to communicate with named with no further config<hy>
uration. Running rndc-confgen with -a specified allows BIND 9 and rndc to be used as drop-in replacements for
BIND 8 and ndc, with no changes to the existing BIND 8 named.conf file.
-b keysize Specify the size of the authentication key in bits. The keysize argument must be between 1 and 512 bits;
the default is 128.
-c keyfile Used with the -a option to specify an alternate location for rndc.key.
-h Print a short summary of the options and arguments to rndc-confgen.
-k keyname Specify the key name of the rndc authentication key. The keyname argument must be a valid domain
name. The default is rndc-key.
-p port Specify the command channel port where named listens for connections from rndc. The default is 953.
-r randomfile Specify a source of random data for generating the authorization. By default, /dev/random is used.
The randomdev argument specifies the name of a character device or file containing random data to be used instead
of the default. The special value keyboard indicates that keyboard input should be used.
-s address Specify the IP address where named listens for command channel connections from rndc. The default is
the loopback address 127.0.0.1.
-t chrootdir Used with the -a option to specify a directory where named will run after the root directory is changed
with chroot(1M). An additional copy of the rndc.key will be written relative to this directory so that it will be found
by the named in the new directory.
-u user Used with the -a option to set the owner of the rndc.key file generated. If -t is also specified only the file in
the chroot area has its owner changed.
Example 1 Create Automatic rndc Configuration
The following command creates an automatic rndc configuration, so that rndc can be used immediately.
 # rndc-confgen -a
Example 2 Print a Sample rndc.conf File
The following command prints a sample rndc.conf file with corresponding controls and key statements. These
statements can subsequently be manually inserted in the file named.conf.
