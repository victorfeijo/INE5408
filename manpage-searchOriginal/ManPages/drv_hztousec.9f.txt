drv_hztousec <-> convert clock ticks to microseconds

clock_t drv_hztousec(clock_t hertz);
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI).
hertz The number of clock ticks to convert.
The drv_hztousec() function converts into microseconds the time expressed by hertz, which is in system clock ticks.
The kernel variable lbolt, whose value should be retrieved by calling ddi_get_lbolt(9F), is the length of time the
system has been up since boot and is expressed in clock ticks. Drivers often use the value of lbolt before and after an
I/O request to measure the amount of time it took the device to process the request. The drv_hztousec() function
can be used by the driver to convert the reading from clock ticks to a known unit of time.
The number of microseconds equivalent to the hertz parameter. No error value is returned. If the microsecond equiv<hy>
alent to hertz is too large to be represented as a clock_t, then the maximum clock_t value will be returned.
The drv_hztousec() function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context.
