bool_t rpc_gss_getcred(struct svc_req *req, rpc_gss_rawcred_ t **rcred,
 rpc_gss_ucred **ucred, void **cookie);
rpc_gss_getcred() is used by a server to fetch the credentials of a client. These credentials may either be network
credentials (in the form of a rpc_gss_rawcred_t structure) or UNIX credentials.
For more information on RPCSEC_GSS data types, see the rpcsec_gss(3NSL) man page.
Essentially, rpc_gss_getcred() passes a pointer to a request (svc_req) as well as pointers to two credential struc<hy>
tures and a user-defined cookie; if rpc_gss_getcred() is successful, at least one credential structure is "filled out"
with values, as is, optionally, the cookie.
req Pointer to the received service request. svc_req is an RPC structure containing information on the context of an
RPC invocation, such as program, version, and transport information.
rcred A pointer to an rpc_gss_rawcred_t structure pointer. This structure contains the version number of the RPC<hy>
SEC_GSS protocol being used; the security mechanism and QOPs for this session (as strings); principal names for
the client (as a rpc_gss_principal_t structure) and server (as a string); and the security service (integrity, privacy,
etc., as an enum). If an application is not interested in these values, it may pass NULL for this parameter.
ucred The caller's UNIX credentials, in the form of a pointer to a pointer to a rpc_gss_ucred_t structure, which in<hy>
cludes the client's uid and gids. If an application is not interested in these values, it may pass NULL for this parame<hy>
ter.
cookie A four-byte quantity that an application may use in any manner it wants to; RPC does not interpret it. (For
example, a cookie may be a pointer or index to a structure that represents a context initiator.) See also
rpc_gss_set_callback(3NSL).
rpc_gss_getcred() returns TRUE if it is successful; otherwise, use rpc_gss_get_error() to get the error associated
with the failure.
