/etc/shells
The shells file contains a list of the shells on the system. Applications use this file to determine whether a shell is
valid. See getusershell(3C). For each shell a single line should be present, consisting of the shell's path, relative to
root.
A hash mark (#) indicates the beginning of a comment; subsequent characters up to the end of the line are not inter<hy>
preted by the routines which search the file. Blank lines are also ignored.
The following default shells are used by utilities: /bin/bash, /bin/csh, /bin/jsh, /bin/ksh, /bin/ksh93, /bin/pfcsh,
/bin/pfksh, /bin/pfsh, /bin/sh, /bin/tcsh, /bin/zsh, /sbin/jsh, /sbin/sh, /usr/bin/bash, /usr/bin/csh, /usr/bin/jsh,
/usr/bin/ksh, /usr/bin/ksh93, /usr/bin/pfcsh, /usr/bin/pfksh, /usr/bin/pfsh, and /usr/bin/sh, /usr/bin/tcsh,
/usr/bin/zsh, and /usr/sfw/bin/zsh. /etc/shells overrides the default list.
Invalid shells in /etc/shells could cause unexpected behavior, such as being unable to log in by way of ftp(1).
