int wdelch(WINDOW *win);
The delch() and wdelch() functions delete the character at the current cursor position from stdscr and win, respec<hy>
tively. All remaining characters after cursor through to the end of the line are shifted one character towards the start
of the line. The last character on the line becomes a space; characters on other lines are not affected.
The mvdelch() and mvwdelch() functions delete the character at the position specified by the x and y parameters;
the former deletes the character from stdscr; the latter from win.
y Is the y (row) coordinate of the position of the character to be removed.
x Is the x (column) coordinate of the position of the character to be removed.
win Is a pointer to the window containing the character to be removed.
On success, these functions return OK. Otherwise, they return ERR.
None.
