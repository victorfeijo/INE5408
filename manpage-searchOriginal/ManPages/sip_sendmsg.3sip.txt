int sip_sendmsg(sip_conn_object_t obj, sip_msg_t sip_msg,
 sip_dialog_t dialog, uint32_t flags);
The sip_sendmsg() function is used to send an outbound SIP message sip_msg to the SIP stack on its way to the
peer. The connection object for the SIP message is passed as obj. The caller also provides the dialog associated with
the message, if one exists. The value of flags is the result of ORing the following, as required:
SIP_SEND_STATEFUL Send the request or response statefully. This results in the stack creating and maintaining a
transaction for this request/response. If this flag is not set transactions are not created for the request/response.
SIP_DIALOG_ON_FORK When this flag is set, the stack may create multiple dialogs for a dialog completing re<hy>
sponse. This may result due to forking of the dialog creating request. If this flag is not set, the first response to a dia<hy>
log creating request creates a dialog, but subsequent ones do not. It is only meaningful if the stack is configured to
maintain dialogs.
The sip_sendmsg() function returns 0 on success and the appropriate error on failure.
The value of errno is not changed by these calls in the event of an error.
The sip_sendmsg() function can return one of the following errors on failure:
EINVAL If a message is being statefully sent and the branchid in the VIA header does not conform to RFC 3261 or
when accessing CSEQ header while creating a transaction.
ENOENT If a message is being statefully sent, error getting the CSEQ header while creating a transaction.
EPROTO If a message is being statefully sent, error getting the CSEQ value while creating a transaction.
ENOMEM If the message is being statefully sent, error allocating memory for creating or adding a transaction or
during transaction related processing.
