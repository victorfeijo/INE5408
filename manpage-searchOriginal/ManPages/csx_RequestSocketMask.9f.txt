The function csx_RequestSocketMask() sets the client's client event mask and enables the client to start receiving
events at its event callback handler. Once this function returns successfully, the client can start receiving events at its
event callback handler. Any pending events generated from the call to csx_RegisterClient(9F) will be delivered to
the client after this call as well. This allows the client to set up the event handler mutexes before the event handler
gets called.
csx_RequestSocketMask() must be used before calling csx_GetEventMask(9F) or csx_SetEventMask(9F) for the
client event mask for this socket.
The function csx_ReleaseSocketMask() clears the client's client event mask.
The structure members of request_socket_mask_t are:
  uint32_t Socket; /* socket number */
  uint32_t EventMask; /* event mask to set or return */
The structure members of release_socket_mask_t are:
  uint32_t Socket; /* socket number */
The fields are defined as follows:
Socket Not used in Solaris, but for portability with other Card Services implementations, it should be set to the logi<hy>
cal socket number.
EventMask This field is bit-mapped. Card Services performs event notification based on this field. See
csx_event_handler(9E) for valid event definitions and for additional information about handling events.
CS_SUCCESS Successful operation.
CS_BAD_HANDLE Client handle is invalid.
CS_IN_USE csx_ReleaseSocketMask() has not been done.
CS_BAD_SOCKET csx_RequestSocketMask() has not been done.
