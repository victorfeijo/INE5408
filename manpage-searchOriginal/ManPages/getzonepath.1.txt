getzonepath <-> display root path of the zone corresponding to the specified label
/usr/bin/getzonepath {sensitivity-label}
getzonepath displays the root pathname of the running labeled zone that corresponds to the specified sensitivity la<hy>
bel. The returned pathname is relative to the caller's root pathname, and has the specified sensitivity label.
If the caller is in the global zone, the returned pathname is not traversable unless the caller's processes have the
file_dac_search privilege.
If the caller is in a labeled zone, the caller's label must dominate the specified label. Access to files under the re<hy>
turned pathname is restricted to read-only operations.
