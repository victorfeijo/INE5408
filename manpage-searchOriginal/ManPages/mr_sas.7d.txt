mr_sas <-> LSI MegaRAID SAS2.0 Controller HBA driver
The mr_sas MegaRAID SAS2.0 controller host bus adapter driver is a SCSA-compliant nexus driver that supports
the LSI MegaRAID SAS 92xx series of controllers and the Sun StorageTek 6Gb/s SAS RAID HBA series of con<hy>
trollers.
Some of the RAID Features include the following: <bu> RAID levels 0, 1, 5, and 6 <bu> RAID spans 10, 50, and 60 <bu> Online
Capacity Expansion (OCE) <bu> Online RAID Level Migration (RLM) <bu> Auto resume after loss of system power during
arrays array rebuild or reconstruction (RLM) <bu> Configurable stripe size up to 1MB <bu> Check Consistency for back<hy>
ground data integrity <bu> Patrol read for media scanning and repairing <bu> 64 logical drive support <bu> Up to 64TB LUN
support <bu> Automatic rebuild <bu> Global and dedicated Hot Spare support
The mr_sas.conf file contains one user configurable parameter, for MSI or MSI-X support. Configure your hardware
through the related BIOS utility or the MegaCli Configuration Utility. If you want to install to a drive attached to a
mr_sas HBA, create the virtual drive first from the BIOS (X86) before running Solaris install. The MegaCli utility
can be downloaded from the LSI website.
The LSI MegaRAID SAS device can support up to 64 virtual SAS2.0, SAS1.0, SATA3.0, or SATA 6.0 disks. The
BIOS numbers the virtual disks as 1 through 64, however in Solaris these drives are numbered from 0 to 63. Also
keep in mind that SAS and SATA drives can not be configured into the same virtual disk.
