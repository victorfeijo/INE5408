mlib_status mlib_ImageSetStruct(mlib_image *image, mlib_type type,

 const void *datbuf);
The mlib_ImageSetStruct() function sets a mediaLib image data structure using parameters supplied by the user.
The mlib_ImageSetStruct() function returns MLIB_FAILURE if the supplied parameters do not pass the follow<hy>
ing sanity checks: <bu> image should not be NULL <bu> type should be MLIB_BIT, MLIB_BYTE, MLIB_SHORT,
MLIB_USHORT, MLIB_INT, MLIB_FLOAT, or MLIB_DOUBLE <bu> channels should be between 1 and 4 <bu>
width should be greater than 0 <bu> height should be greater than 0 <bu> stride should be no less than width * channels *
(size of type in bytes) <bu> datbuf should not be NULL
Whenever MLIB_FAILURE is returned, the original image data structure is not changed.
If the data buffer in the image data structure is not NULL, it is the user's responsibility to free it if necessary.
The function takes the following arguments:
image Pointer to the image data structure.
type Image data type. It can be MLIB_BIT, MLIB_BYTE, MLIB_SHORT, MLIB_USHORT, MLIB_INT,
MLIB_FLOAT, or MLIB_DOUBLE.
channels Number of channels in the image.
width Width of image in pixels.
height Height of image in pixels.
stride Stride of each row of the data space in bytes.
datbuf Pointer to the image data buffer.
MLIB_SUCCESS is returned if the image data structure is set successfully. MLIB_FAILURE is returned when the
image data structure can not be set according to the parameters supplied.
