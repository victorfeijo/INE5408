nisdefaults <-> display NIS+ default values
nisdefaults [-adghprstv]
The nisdefaults utility prints the default values that are returned by calls to the NIS+ local name functions (see
nis_local_names(3NSL)). With no options specified, all defaults will be printed in a verbose format. With options,
only that option is displayed in a terse form suitable for shell scripts. See the example below.
The following options are supported:
-a Print all defaults in a terse format.
-d Print the default domain name.
-g Print the default group name.
-h Print the default host name.
-p Print the default principal name.
-r Print the default access rights with which new objects will be created.
-s Print the default directory search path.
-t Print the default time to live value.
-v Print the defaults in a verbose format. This prepends an identifying string to the output.
Example 1 Printing NIS+ defaults
The following prints the NIS+ defaults for a root process on machine example in the foo.bar. domain:
 example# nisdefaults
 Principal Name : example.foo.bar.
 Domain Name : foo.bar.
 Host Name : example.foo.bar.
 Group Name :
 Access Rights : <mi><mi><mi><mi>rmcdr<mi><mi><mi>r<mi><mi><mi>
 Time to live : 12:00:00
 Search Path : foo.bar.
Example 2 Setting a variable in the shell script
This example sets a variable in a shell script to the default domain:
 DOMAIN=`nisdefaults -d`
Example 3 Printing the default time to live in verbose format
This example prints out the default time to live in a verbose format:
 example% nisdefaults -tv
 Time to live : 12:00:00

Example 4 Printing the time to live in terse format
This example prints out the time to live in the terse format:
 example% nisdefaults -t
 43200
Several environment variables affect the defaults associated with a process.
NIS_DEFAULTS This variable contains a defaults string that will override the NIS+ standard defaults. The defaults
string is a series of tokens separated by colons. These tokens represent the default values to be used for the generic
object properties. All of the legal tokens are described below.
ttl=time This token sets the default time to live for objects that are created. The value time is specified in the format
as defined by the nischttl(1) command. The default value is 12 hours.
owner=ownername This token specifies that the NIS+ principal ownername should own created objects. The de<hy>
fault for this value is the principal who is executing the command.
group=groupname This token specifies that the group groupname should be the group owner for created objects.
The default is NULL.
access=rights This token specifies the set of access rights that are to be granted for created objects. The value rights
is specified in the format as defined by the nischmod(1) command. The default value is: <mi><mi><mi><mi>rmcdr<mi><mi><mi>r<mi><mi><mi>.
NIS_GROUP This variable contains the name of the local NIS+ group. If the name is not fully qualified, the default
domain will be appended to it.
NIS_PATH This variable overrides the default NIS+ directory search path. It contains an ordered list of directories
separated by ':' (colon) characters. The '$' (dollar sign) character is treated specially. Directory names that end in
'$' have the default domain appended to them, and a '$' by itself is replaced by the list of directories between the
default domain and the global root that are at least two levels deep. The default NIS+ directory search path is '$'.
Refer to the Name Expansion subsection in NIS+(1) for more details.

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
NIS+ to LDAP are available in the current Solaris release. For more information, visit http://www.sun.com/directo<hy>
