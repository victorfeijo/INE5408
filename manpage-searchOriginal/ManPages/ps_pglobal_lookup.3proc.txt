ps_pglobal_lookup() looks up the symbol sym_name in the symbol table of the load object object_name in the tar<hy>
get process identified by ph. It returns the symbol's value as an address in the target process in *sym_addr.
ps_pglobal_sym() looks up the symbol sym_name in the symbol table of the load object object_name in the target
process identified by ph. It returns the symbol table entry in *sym. The value in the symbol table entry is the sym<hy>
bol's value as an address in the target process.
