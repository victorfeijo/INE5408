dhtadm manages the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) service configuration table, dhcptab. You can
use it to add, delete, or modify DHCP configuration macros or options or view the table. For a description of the ta<hy>
ble format, see dhcptab(4).)
The dhtadm command can be run by root, or by other users assigned to the DHCP Management profile. See rbac(5)
and user_attr(4).
After you make changes with dhtadm, you should issue a SIGHUP to the DHCP server, causing it to read the
dhcptab and pick up the changes. Do this using the -g option.
One of the following function flags must be specified with the dhtadm command: -A, -B, -C, -D, -M, -P or -R.
The following options are supported:
-A Add a symbol or macro definition to the dhcptab table.
The following sub-options are required:
-d definition Specify a macro or symbol definition.
definition must be enclosed in single quotation marks. For macros, use the form -d ':symbol=value:symbol=value:'.
Enclose a value that contains colons in double quotation marks. For symbols, the definition is a series of fields that
define a symbol's characteristics. The fields are separated by commas. Use the form -d 'context,code,type,granulari<hy>
ty,maximum'. See dhcptab(4) for information about these fields.
-m macro_name Specify the name of the macro to be added.
The -d option must be used with the -m option. The -s option cannot be used with the -m option.
<beginning of page>
-s symbol_name Specify the name of the symbol to be added.
The -d option must be used with the -s option. The -m option cannot be used with the -s option.
-B Batch process dhtadm commands. dhtadm reads from the specified file or from standard input a series of
dhtadm commands and execute them within the same process. Processing many dhtadm commands using this
method is much faster than running an executable batchfile itself. Batch mode is recommended for using dhtadm in
scripts.
The following sub-option is optional:
-v Display commands to standard output as they are processed.
-C Create the DHCP service configuration table, dhcptab.
-D Delete a symbol or macro definition.
The following sub-options are required:
-m macro_name Delete the specified macro.
-s symbol_name Delete the specified symbol.
-g Signal the DHCP daemon to reload the dhcptab after successful completion of the operation.
-M Modify an existing symbol or macro definition.
The following sub-options are required:
-d definition Specify a macro or symbol definition to modify.
The definition must be enclosed in single quotation marks. For macros, use the form -d ':symbol=value:symbol=val<hy>
ue:'. Enclose a value that contains colons in double quotation marks. For symbols, the definition is a series of fields
that define a symbol's characteristics. The fields are separated by commas. Use the form -d 'context,code,type,gran<hy>
ularity,maximum'. See dhcptab(4) for information about these fields.
-e This sub-option uses the symbol =value argument. Use it to edit a symbol/value pair within a macro. To add a
symbol which does not have an associate value, enter:
 symbol=_NULL_VALUE_
To delete a symbol definition from a macro, enter:
 symbol=
-m This sub-option uses the macro_name argument. The -n, -d, or -e sub-options are legal companions for this sub-
option..
<beginning of page>
-n This sub-option uses the new_name argument and modifies the name of the object specified by the -m or -s sub-
option. It is not limited to macros. . Use it to specify a new macro name or symbol name.
-s This sub-option uses the symbol_name argument. Use it to specify a symbol. The -d sub-option is a legal compan<hy>
ion.
-p path Override the dhcpsvc.conf(4) configuration value for PATH= with path. See dhcpsvc.conf(4) for more de<hy>
tails regarding path. See dhcp_modules(5) for information regarding data storage modules for the DHCP service.
-P Print (display) the dhcptab table.
-r data_store_resource Override the dhcpsvc.conf(4) configuration value for RESOURCE= with the data_store_re<hy>
source specified. See dhcpsvc.conf(4) for more details on resource type. See for more information about adding
support for other data stores. See dhcp_modules(5) for information regarding data storage modules for the DHCP
service.
-R Remove the dhcptab table.
-u uninterpreted Data which is ignored by dhtadm, but passed to currently configured public module, to be inter<hy>
preted by the data store. The private layer provides for module-specific configuration information through the use of
the RESOURCE_CONFIG keyword. Uninterpreted data is stored within RESOURCE_CONFIG keyword of
dhcpsvc.conf(4). See dhcp_modules(5) for information regarding data storage modules for the DHCP service.
Example 1 Creating the DHCP Service Configuration Table
The following command creates the DHCP service configuration table, dhcptab:
 # dhtadm -C
Example 2 Adding a Symbol Definition
The following command adds a Vendor option symbol definition for a new symbol called MySym to the dhcptab
table in the SUNWfiles resource in the /var/mydhcp directory:
 # dhtadm -A -s MySym
  -d 'Vendor=SUNW.PCW.LAN,20,IP,1,0'
  -r SUNWfiles -p /var/mydhcp
Example 3 Adding a Macro Definition
The following command adds the aruba macro definition to the dhcptab table. Note that symbol/value pairs are
bracketed with colons (:).
 # dhtadm -A -m aruba \
  -d ':Timeserv=10.0.0.10 10.0.0.11:DNSserv=10.0.0.1:'
Example 4 Modifying a Macro Definition
The following command modifies the Locale macro definition, setting the value of the UTCOffst symbol to 18000
seconds. Note that any macro definition which includes the definition of the Locale macro inherits this change.
 # dhtadm -M -m Locale -e 'UTCOffst=18000'
<beginning of page>
Example 5 Deleting a Symbol
The following command deletes the Timeserv symbol from the aruba macro. Any macro definition which includes
the definition of the aruba macro inherits this change.
 # dhtadm -M -m aruba -e 'Timeserv='
Example 6 Adding a Symbol to a Macro
The following command adds the Hostname symbol to the aruba macro. Note that the Hostname symbol takes no
value, and thus requires the special value _NULL_VALUE_. Note also that any macro definition which includes the
definition of the aruba macro inherits this change.
 # dhtadm -M -m aruba -e 'Hostname=_NULL_VALUE_'
Example 7 Renaming a Macro
The following command renames the Locale macro to MyLocale. Note that any Include statements in macro defini<hy>
tions which include the Locale macro also need to be changed.
 # dhtadm -M -m Locale -n MyLocale
Example 8 Deleting a Symbol Definition
The following command deletes the MySym symbol definition. Note that any macro definitions which use MySym
needs to be modified.
 # dhtadm -D -s MySym
Example 9 Removing a dhcptab
The following command removes the dhcptab table in the NIS+ directory specified.
 # dhtadm -R -r SUNWnisplus -p Test.Nis.Plus.
Example 10 Printing a dhcptab
The following command prints to standard output the contents of the dhcptab that is located in the data store and
path indicated in the dhcpsvc.conf file:.
 # dhtadm -P
Example 11 Executing dhtadm in Batch Mode
The following command runs a series of dhtadm commands contained in a batch file and signals the daemon to
reload the dhcptab once the commands have been executed: :
 # dhtadm -B addmacros -g
