script <-> make record of a terminal session
script [-a] [filename]
The script utility makes a record of everything printed on your screen. The record is written to filename. If no file
name is given, the record is saved in the file typescript. See WARNINGS.
The script command forks and creates a sub-shell, according to the value of $SHELL, and records the text from this
session. The script ends when the forked shell exits or when Control-d is typed.
The following option is supported:
-a Appends the session record to filename, rather than overwriting it.
script places everything that appears on the screen in filename, including prompts.
