fegetexceptflag, fesetexceptflag <-> get and set floating-point status flags
cc [ flag... ] file... -lm [ library... ]
#include <fenv.h>
int fegetexceptflag(fexcept_t *flagp, int excepts);
int fesetexceptflag(const fexcept_t *flagp, int excepts);
The fegetexceptflag() function attempts to store an implementation-defined representation of the states of the float<hy>
ing-point status flags indicated by the excepts argument in the object pointed to by the flagp argument.
The fesetexceptflag() function attempts to set the floating-point status flags indicated by the excepts argument to the
states stored in the object pointed to by flagp. The value pointed to by flagp will have been set by a previous call to
fegetexceptflag() whose second argument represented at least those floating-point exceptions represented by the ex<hy>
cepts argument. This function does not raise floating-point exceptions but only sets the state of the flags.
If the representation was successfully stored, fegetexceptflag() returns 0. Otherwise, it returns a non-zero value.
If the excepts argument is 0 or if all the specified exceptions were successfully set, fesetexceptflag() returns 0. Oth<hy>
erwise, it returns a non-zero value.
No errors are defined.
