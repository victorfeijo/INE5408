sata <-> Solaris SATA framework
Serial ATA is an interconnect technology designed to replace parallel ATA technology. It is used to connect hard
drives, optical drives, removable magnetic media devices and other peripherals to the host system. For complete in<hy>
formation on Serial ATA technology, visit the Serial ATA web site at http://www.serialata.org.
Up to 32 SATA devices may be plugged directly to each SATA HBA and up to 15 SATA devices may be plugged di<hy>
rectly to each SATA port multiplier supported by the Solaris SATA framework. The actual number of pluggable de<hy>
vices my be lower, and is limited by the number of device ports on the SATA HBA or the SATA port multiplier. The
maximum data rate is either 1.5Gb/sec. or 3.0Gb/sec., depending on the capability of a SATA device, port multiplier
and SATA HBA controller.
The Solaris SATA framework adheres to the Serial ATA 1.0a specification and supports SATA-2 signaling speed
3.0Gb/sec. SATA devices that are connected to SATA HBAs controlled by a SATA framework-compliant HBA driv<hy>
er are treated by the system as SCSI devices. The Solaris SCSI disk driver (sd(7D)) is attached as a target driver for
each device node created by the SATA framework. You can use the cfgadm(1M) utility to manage hot plugged and
unplugged SATA devices.

The messages described below may appear on the system console as well as being logged. All messages are present<hy>
ed in one of the following formats and are followed by the diagnostic message:
 sata: WARNING: <controller/devices/.. path>:
or:
 sata: NOTICE: <controller/devices/.. path>:
...where <controller/devices/.. path> identifies a specific SATA HBA issuing a diagnostic message shown below.
SATA port X: link lost.
Communication (via serial link) between the HBA and the device plugged to the specified SATA device port has
been lost.
SATA port X: link established.
Communication (via serial link) between the HBA and the device plugged to the specified SATA device port has
been established.
<beginning of page>
SATA port X: device reset.
The device plugged to the specified SATA device port has been reset. The reset may be due to a communication or
command error, command timeout, or an explicit request from the host.
SATA port X failed.
The specified SATA device port failed and is in an unusable state. You can change the port state by deactivating the
port and activating it again using cfgadm SATA hardware-specific commands (see cfgadm_sata(1M)).
SATA port X error.
An error was detected in specified SATA device port operations.
SATA device detached at port X.
Communication (via serial link) between the HBA and the device plugged to the specified SATA device port has
been lost and could not be re-established. The SATA framework assumes that the device is unplugged from the spec<hy>
ified SATA device port.
SATA device detected at port X.
Communication( via serial link) between the HBA and the device plugged to the specified empty SATA device port
has been established. The SATA framework assumes that the new device is plugged to the specified SATA device
port.
SATA disk device at port X.
This message is followed by a disk description specifying the disk vendor, serial number, firmware revision number
and the disk capabilities.
SATA CD/DVD (ATAPI) device at port X.
This message is followed by a SATA CD/DVD description specifying the DVD vendor, serial number, firmware re<hy>
vision number and the DVD capabilities.
SATA device at port X cannot be configured. Application(s) accessing previously attached device have to re<hy>
lease it before newly inserted device can be made accessible.
The port cannot be configured because there is application using the previous attached device, so the application
must release it, then the newly inserted device can be configured.
Application(s) accessing previously attached SATA device have to release it before newly inserted device can
be made accessible.
The target node remained and it belongs to a previously attached device. This happens when the file was open or the
node was waiting for resources at the time the associated device was removed. Instruct event daemon to retry the
cleanup later.
sata: error recovery request for non-attached device at cport X.
When error recovery is requested, the device is not yet attached.
SATA device at port X is not power-managed.
When property pm-capable on the target device node setting fails, the SATA device won't be power-managed.
<beginning of page>
SATA disk device at port X does not support LBA.
The disk device plugged into specified SATA device port does not support LBA addressing and cannot be used.
Cannot identify SATA device at port X - device is attached.
IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE data cannot be retrieved successfully after the device is attached to the SATA port.
sata: <HBA driver name><instance number>:hba attached failed.
The SATA HBA instance attach operation failed. This HBA instance cannot be configured and is not available.
sata: invalid ATAPI cdb length<command cdb length>.
The length of the command cdb is greater than that the device can support.
sata: invalid sata_hba_tran version X for driver <HBA driver name>.
The specified SATA HBA driver and the SATA framework are incompatible. The driver cannot attach and SATA
HBAs controlled by this driver (and devices plugged to this SATA HBA ports) are not available.
sata_hba_attach: cannot create SATA attachment point for port X.
The specified SATA device port cannot be configured in the system and a device plugged to this port could not be
not be configured and used.
sata_create_target_node: cannot create target node for device at port X.
The device target node for the device plugged to the specified SATA device port could not be created. As a result, the
device cannot be configured and used.
