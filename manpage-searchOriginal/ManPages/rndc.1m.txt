rndc <-> name server control utility
rndc [-V] [-c config-file] [-k key-file] [-s server]
 [-p port] [-y key_id] command
The rndc utility controls the operation of a name server. It supersedes the ndc utility that was provided in previous
BIND releases. If rndc is invoked with no command line options or arguments, it prints a short summary of the sup<hy>
ported commands and the available options and their arguments.
The rndc utility communicates with the name server over a TCP connection, sending commands authenticated with
digital signatures. The only supported authentication algorithm in the current versions of rndc and named(1M) is
HMAC-MD5, which uses a shared secret on each end of the connection. This algorithm provides TSIG-style authen<hy>
tication for the command request and the name server's response. All commands sent over the channel must be
signed by a key_id known to the server.
The rndc utility reads a configuration file to determine how to contact the name server and decide what algorithm
and key it should use.
The following options are supported:
-c config-file Use config-file as the configuration file instead of the default /etc/rndc.conf.
-k key-file Use key-file as the key file instead of the default, /etc/rndc.key. The key in /etc/rndc.key is used to au<hy>
thenticate commands sent to the server if the config-file does not exist.
-s server The server argument is the name or address of the server that matches a server statement in the configura<hy>
tion file for rndc. If no server is supplied on the command line, the host named by the default-server clause in the
options statement of the rndc configuration file is used.
-p port Send commands to TCP port port instead of BIND 9's default control channel port, 953.
-V Enable verbose logging.
-y key_id Use the key key_id from the configuration file. The key_id argument must be known by named with the
same algorithm and secret string for control message validation to succeed. If no key_id is specified, rndc will first
look for a key clause in the server statement of the server being used, or if no server statement is present for that
host, then the default-key clause of the options statement. The configuration file contains shared secrets that are
used to send authenticated control commands to name servers. It should therefore not have general read or write ac<hy>
cess.
For the complete set of commands supported by rndc, see the BIND 9 Administrator Reference Manual or run rndc
without arguments to see its help message.
The rndc utility does not support all the commands of the BIND 8 ndc utility.
There is no way to provide the shared secret for a key_id without using the configuration file.
Several error messages could be clearer.
