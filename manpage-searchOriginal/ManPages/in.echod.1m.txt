in.echod <-> UDP or TCP echo protocol service daemon
in.echod
FMRI svc:/internet/echo:default
FMRI stands for Fault Management Resource Identifier. It is used to identify resources managed by the Fault Man<hy>
ager. See fmd(1M) and smf(5).
The in.echod service provides the server-side of the echo protocol. This protocol is used for debugging and band<hy>
width measurement and is available on both TCP and UDP transports, through port 7.
The in.echod service is an inetd(1M) smf(5) delegated service. The in.echod detects which transport is requested
by examining the socket it is passed by the inetd daemon.
TCP-based service Once a connection is established, the in.echod echoes any data received from the client back to
the client. The server echoes data until the client program terminates the connection.
UDP-based service The in.echod listens for UDP datagrams. When a datagram is received, the server creates a
UDP datagram containing the data it received and sends it to the client.
