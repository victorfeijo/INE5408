mbsinit <-> determine conversion object status
#include <wchar.h>
int mbsinit(const mbstate_t *ps);
If ps is not a null pointer, the mbsinit() function determines whether the object pointed to by ps describes an initial
conversion state.
The mbsinit() function returns non-zero if ps is a null pointer, or if the pointed-to object describes an initial conver<hy>
sion state; otherwise, it returns 0.
If an mbstate_t object is altered by any of the functions described as "restartable", and is then used with a different
character sequence, or in the other conversion direction, or with a different LC_CTYPE category setting than on
earlier function calls, the behavior is undefined. See environ(5).
No errors are defined.
The mbstate_t object is used to describe the current conversion state from a particular character sequence to a wide-
character sequence (or vice versa) under the rules of a particular setting of the LC_CTYPE category of the current
locale.
The initial conversion state corresponds, for a conversion in either direction, to the beginning of a new character se<hy>
quence in the initial shift state. A zero-valued mbstate_t object is at least one way to describe an initial conversion
state. A zero-valued mbstate_t object can be used to initiate conversion involving any character sequence, in any
LC_CTYPE category setting.

The mbsinit() function can be used safely in multithreaded applications, as long as setlocale(3C) is not being called
to change the locale.
