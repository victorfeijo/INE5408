nisrestore <-> restore NIS+ directory backup
nisrestore [-fv] backup-dir directory...
nisrestore [-fv] -a backup-dir
nisrestore -t backup-dir
nisrestore restores an existing backup of a NIS+ directory object that was created using nisbackup(1M). The back<hy>
up-dir is the UNIX directory that contains the NIS+ backup on the server being restored. The nisrestore command
can be used to restore a NIS+ directory object or a complete NIS+ database. It also can be used as an "out of band"
fast replication for a new replica server being initialized. The rpc.nisd(1M) daemon must be stopped before running
nisrestore.
The first synopsis is used to restore a single directory object or a specified list of directory objects. The directory can
be partially qualified or fully qualified. The server being restored will be verified against the list of servers serving
the directory. If this server is not configured to serve this object, nisrestore will exit with an error. The -f option will
override this check and force the operation.
The second synopsis will restore all of the directory objects contained in the backup-dir. Again, the server will be
validated against the serving list for each of the directory objects in the backup-dir. If one of the objects in the back<hy>
up-dir are not served by this server, nisrestore will exit with an error. The -f option will override this check and
force the operation.
The -a option will attempt to restore all NIS+ objects contained in the backup-dir. If any of these objects are not
served by the server, nisrestore will exit with an error. If the backup-dir contains objects that are not served by the
server, nisrestore must be executed without the -a option and the specific directory objects listed.
The -f option will disable verification of the server being configured to serve the objects being restored. This option
should be used with care, as data could be inadvertently restored to a server that doesn't serve the restored data. This
option is required in the case of restoring a single server domain (master server only) or if the other NIS+ servers are
unavailable for NIS+ lookups.
The combination of options -f and -a should be used with caution, as no validation of the server serving the restored
objects will be done.
New replicas can be quickly added to a namespace with the nisrestore command. The steps are as follows.
Configure the new replica on the master server (see nisserver(1M)):
 master# nisserver -R -h replica
Temporarily stop the rpc.nisd server process on the new replica server:
 replica# svcadm disable -t network/rpc/nisplus:default
Create a backup of the NIS+ database on the master, which will include the new replica information. See nisback<hy>
up(1M). The /backup will need to be exported to the new replica. See share_nfs(1M).
 master# nisbackup -a /backup
Restore the backup of the NIS+ database on the new replica. Use the -f option if nisrestore is unable to lookup the
NIS+ objects being restored. The backup should be available through nfs or similar means. See share_nfs(1M).
 replica# nisrestore -f -a //nfs-mnt/backup
Restart the rpc.nisd(1M) process on the new replica, and the server will immediately be available for service:
<beginning of page>
 replica# svcadm enable network/rpc/nisplus:default
The following options are supported:
-a Restores all directory objects included in the backup-dir partition.
-f Forces the restoration of a directory without the validation of the server in the directory object's serving list.
-t Lists all directory objects contained in backup-dir.
-v Verbose option. Additional output will be produced upon execution of the command.
The following options are supported:
backup-dir The UNIX directory that contains the data files for the NIS+ directory objects to be restored.
directory The NIS+ directory object(s) to be restored. This can be a fully or partially qualified name.
Example 1 Restoring the Directory Object on a Replica Server from a Local UFS Partition
To restore the org_dir directory object of the domain foo.com on a replica server from a local ufs partition named
/var/backup:
 replica_server# nisrestore /var/backup org_dir.foo.com.
Example 2 Forcing the Restore of a Backed up NIS+ Namespace to a Replica Server From the Backup Partition
To force the restore of an entire backed up NIS+ namespace to a replica server from the backup partition named
/var/backup:
 replica_server# nisrestore -f -a /var/backup
Example 3 Restoring the Subdomain on a Master Server From a Backup that Includes Other Directory Objects
To restore the subdomain sub.foo.com on a master server, from a backup that includes other directory objects:
 master_server# nisrestore /var/backup sub.foo.com. \
  org_dir.sub.foo.com. groups_dir.sub.foo.com.
0 Successful completion.
1 An error occurred.

/backup-dir/directory-object/last.upd
This data file contains timestamp information about the directory-object.
/backup-dir/directory-object/data.dict

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris Operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
NIS+ to LDAP are available in the current Solaris release. For more information, visit http://www.sun.com/directo<hy>

The NIS+ service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/network/rpc/nisplus:default
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). The service's status can be queried using the svcs(1) command.
