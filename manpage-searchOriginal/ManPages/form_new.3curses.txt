FORM *new_form(FIELD **fields);

free_form() disconnects the form from its associated field pointer array and deallocates the space for the form.
new_form() always returns NULL on error. free_form() returns one of the following:
E_OK The function returned successfully.
E_BAD_ARGUMENT An argument is incorrect.
E_POSTED The form is posted.
