vscanadm stats [-z]
The vscanadm command sets and displays properties of the vscan service, vscand(1M), and provides scan statis<hy>
tics.
File system exemption from virus scanning may be configured per file system using the appropriate file system ad<hy>
ministrative command, for example zfs(1M).
Scan engines are third-party applications on external hosts that perform the actual virus scanning operation on files.
Multiple scan engines can be configured for use by the vscan service. A minimum of two scan engines is recom<hy>
mended. File scan requests are distributed among the configured scan engines to achieve load balancing. A scan en<hy>
gine is identified by its engine_id. The engine_id is a user defined string of up to 64 bytes.
The vscan service properties are divided into two categories: scan engine properties, which are specific to a scan en<hy>
gine definition, and general properties, which apply to the service and are not scan engine-specific.
vscanadm recognizes the following subcommands:
vscanadm set -p property=value [-p property=value]...
Sets the values of vscan service general properties.
-p property=value Specifies a property value
vscanadm get [-p property]...
Displays the values of vscan service general properties. If no properties are specified, all vscan service general prop<hy>
erties are displayed.
-p property Specifies a property value
The following properties are available for the vscanadm set and vscanadm get subcommands:
max-size The maximum size of files that should be virus scanned. Files exceeding max-size are not scanned. The
max-size-action property determines whether access should be allowed or denied to files that exceed max-size.
The value of max-size is a string with a numeric (decimal) component and an optional letter component that speci<hy>
fies a unit size, in the format "N[.N][KMGTP][B]".
Following the numeric component, the optional unit can be specified as either one or two characters. For example,
either "K" or "KB" can be used to specify kilobytes. Unit specifiers are not case-sensitive, and must follow the nu<hy>
<beginning of page>
meric value immediately with no intervening whitespace.
With either no unit specifier, or a unit specifier of only "B", the numeric value is assumed to be in bytes. The default
value is 1GB.
Note that while the vscan service defines a maximum file size for scanning, scan engines also typically define their
own maximum file size setting. It is recommended that max-size be set to a value less than or equal to the maximum
file size for the scan engine(s).
max-size-action Specifies whether access will be allowed or denied to files larger than max-size. Files larger than
max-size are not virus scanned. Valid values are:
allow allow access to files larger than max-size (no virus scan). This is the default value.
deny deny access to files larger than max-size (no virus scan)
vscanadm import -p property filename
Imports the property value from the specified file. The file must contain a single line specifying the value of a single
property.
vscanadm export -p property filename
Exports the property value to the specified file. The file must contain a single line specifying the value of a single
property.
vscanadm validate -p property filename
Validates the property value in the specified file. The file must contain a single line specifying the value of a single
property.
The following properties are available for the vscanadm import, vscanadm export, and vscanadm validate sub<hy>
commands:
types A comma-separated list of file type extension matching rules. This list defines which types of files are scanned
and which should be excluded during virus scanning. Each rule comprises the rule indicator [+|-], followed by a file
type expresssion against which a file's type extension is compared. The file type expresssion is case insensitive and
may include the "*" and "?" wildcards. There should be no whitespace between the rule indicator and the file type
expresssion. If a comma is included within the file type expression, it must be escaped using a "\" (backslash). A file
type extension does not include its preceding dot.
The rule indicator is a single character and can be one of:
 + include file type in virus scanning
 - exclude file type from virus scanning
When a file is being evaluated as a candidate for virus scanning, its file type will be compared with the rules defined
in types. The first rule matched will be applied. If no match is found, the file will be virus scanned. The total length
of the types string can not exceed 4096 bytes. The default content of the types list is "+*".
vscanadm add-engine [-p property=value]... engine_id
Adds a new scan engine identified by engine_id. The default values are used for any scan engine properties that are
not specified. The hostname defaults to the engine_id.
-p property=value Specifies a property value
<beginning of page>
vscanadm remove-engine engine_id
Remove scan engine identified by engine_id, removing all of its configuration property values.
vscanadm set-engine -pproperty=value [-p property=value]... engine_id
Creates or updates the configuration property values for the scan engine identified by engine_id.
-p property=value Specifies a property value
vscanadm get-engine [-p property=value]... [engine_id]
Displays the values of the specified scan engine properties for the scan engine identified by engine_id. If no en<hy>
gine_id is specified, this subcommand displays the specified scan engine property values for all configured scan en<hy>
gines. If no properties are specified, this subcommand displays all vscan service scan engine properties.
-p property=value Specifies a property value
The following properties are available for the vscanadm add-engine, vscanadm remove-engine, vscanadm set-en<hy>
gine, and vscanadm get-engine subcommands:
enable Specifies whether the scan engine is enabled or disabled. Valid values are "on" (enabled) and "off" (dis<hy>
abled). The default is "on" (enabled). A scan engine cannot be enabled if its host property is invalid.
host Hostname or IPv4 format IP address of the scan engine.
port ICAP port number of the scan engine. The numeric value ranges from 0 to 65535. The default ICAP port is
1344.
max-connection The maximum number of concurrent connections that may be established with a scan engine. The
numeric value ranges from 1 to 512. This property defaults to 8.
vscanadm show Displays the values of all vscan service general properties and scan engine properties.
vscanadm stats [-z] Displays or resets the following vscan service statistics: <bu> number of files scanned <bu> number of
infected files <bu> number of failed scan requests <bu> scan errors (including a per scan engine error count)
-z Resets vscan service statistics counters to zero
