uucleanup <-> uucp spool directory clean-up
/usr/lib/uucp/uucleanup [-Ctime] [-Dtime] [-mstring]
 [-otime] [-ssystem] [-Wtime] [-xdebug-level] [-Xtime]
uucleanup will scan the spool directories for old files and take appropriate action to remove them in a useful way: <bu>
Inform the requester of send/receive requests for systems that can not be reached. <bu> Return undeliverable mail to the
sender. <bu> Deliver rnews files addressed to the local system. <bu> Remove all other files.
In addition, there is a provision to warn users of requests that have been waiting for a given number of days (default
1 day). Note: uucleanup will process as if all option times were specified to the default values unless time is specif<hy>
ically set.
This program is typically started by the shell uudemon.cleanup, which should be started by cron(1M).
-Ctime Remove any C. files greater or equal to time days old and send appropriate information to the requester (de<hy>
fault 7 days).
-Dtime Remove any D. files greater or equal to time days old, make an attempt to deliver mail messages, and ex<hy>
ecute rnews when appropriate (default 7 days).
-mstring Include string in the warning message generated by the -W option. The default line is "See your local ad<hy>
ministrator to locate the problem".
-otime Delete other files whose age is more than time days (default 2 days).
-ssystem Execute for system spool directory only.
-Wtime Any C. files equal to time days old will cause a mail message to be sent to the requester warning about the
delay in contacting the remote. The message includes the JOBID, and in the case of mail, the mail message. The ad<hy>
ministrator may include a message line telling whom to call to check the problem (-m option) (default 1 day).
-xdebug-level Produce debugging output on standard ouput. debug-level is a single digit between 0 and 9; higher
numbers give more detailed debugging information. (This option may not be available on all systems.)
-Xtime Any X. files greater or equal to time days old will be removed. The D. files are probably not present (if they
were, the X. could get executed). But if there are D. files, they will be taken care of by D. processing (default 2
days).
