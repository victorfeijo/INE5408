rint, rintf, rintl <-> round-to-nearest integral value
c99 [ flag... ] file... -lm [ library... ]
#include <math.h>
double rint(double x);
float rintf(float x);
long double rintl(long double x);
These functions return the integral value (represented as a double) nearest x in the direction of the current rounding
mode.
If the current rounding mode rounds toward negative infinity, rint() is equivalent to floor(3M). If the current round<hy>
ing mode rounds toward positive infinity, rint() is equivalent to ceil(3M).
These functions differ from the nearbyint(3M), nearbyintf(), and nearbyintl() functions only in that they might
raise the inexact floating-point exception if the result differs in value from the argument.
Upon successful completion, these functions return the integer (represented as a double precision number) nearest x
in the direction of the current rounding mode.
If x is NaN, a NaN is returned.
If x is <+->0 or <+->Inf, x is returned.
