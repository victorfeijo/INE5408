scsi_device <-> SCSI device structure
#include <sys/scsi/scsi.h>
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
The scsi_device structure stores common information about each SCSI logical unit, including pointers to areas that
contain both generic and device specific information. There is one scsi_device structure for each logical unit at<hy>
tached to the system. The host adapter driver initializes part of this structure prior to probe(9E) and destroys this
structure after a probe failure or successful detach(9E).
 struct scsi_address sd_address; /* Routing info. */
 dev_info_t *sd_dev; /* Cross-ref. to */
  /* dev_info_t */
 kmutex_t sd_mutex; /* Mutex for this dev. */
 struct scsi_inquiry *sd_inq; /* scsi_inquiry data struc. */
 struct scsi_extended_sense *sd_sense; /* Optional request */
  /* sense buffer ptr */
 caddr_t sd_private; /* Target drivers
  private data */
sd_address contains the routing information that the target driver normally copies into a scsi_pkt(9S) structure us<hy>
ing the collection of makecom(9F) functions. The SCSA library routines use this information to determine which
host adapter, SCSI bus, and target/logical unit number (lun) a command is intended for. This structure is initialized
by the host adapter driver.
sd_dev is a pointer to the corresponding dev_info structure. This pointer is initialized by the host adapter driver.
sd_mutex is a mutual exclusion lock for this device. It is used to serialize access to a device. The host adapter driver
initializes this mutex. See mutex(9F).
sd_inq is initially NULL (zero). After executing scsi_probe(9F), this field contains the inquiry data associated with
the particular device.
sd_sense is initially NULL (zero). If the target driver wants to use this field for storing REQUEST SENSE data, it
should allocate an scsi_extended_sense(9S) buffer and set this field to the address of this buffer.
sd_private is reserved for the use of target drivers and should generally be used to point to target specific data struc<hy>
tures.
