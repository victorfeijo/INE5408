esp <-> ESP SCSI Host Bus Adapter Driver
esp@sbus-slot,80000
The esp Host Bus Adapter driver is a SCSA compliant nexus driver that supports the Emulex family of esp SCSI
chips (esp100, esp100A, esp236, fas101, fas236).
The esp driver supports the standard functions provided by the SCSA interface. The driver supports tagged and un<hy>
tagged queuing, fast SCSI (on FAS esp's only), almost unlimited transfer size (using a moving DVMA window ap<hy>
proach), and auto request sense; but it does not support linked commands.
The esp driver can be configured by defining properties in esp.conf which override the global SCSI settings. Sup<hy>
ported properties are: scsi-options, target<n>-scsi-options, scsi-reset-delay, scsi-watchdog-tick, scsi-tag-age-lim<hy>
it, scsi-initiator-id.
target<n>-scsi-options overrides the scsi-options property value for target<n>. <n> can vary from 0 to 7.
Refer to scsi_hba_attach(9F) for details. Example 1 A sample of esp configuration file.
Create a file /kernel/drv/esp.conf and add this line:
 scsi-options=0x78;
This will disable tagged queuing, fast SCSI, and Wide mode for all esp instances. To disable an option for one spe<hy>
cific esp (refer to driver.conf(4)):
 name="esp"
 parent="/iommu@f,e0000000/sbus@f,e0001000/espdma@f,400000"
  reg=0xf,0x800000,0x40
  target1-scsi-options=0x58
  scsi-options=0x178 scsi-initiator-id=6;
Note that the default initiator ID in OBP is 7 and that the change to ID 6 will occur at attach time. It may be prefer<hy>
able to change the initiator ID in OBP.
The above would set scsi-options for target 1 to 0x58 and for all other targets on this SCSI bus to 0x178. The
physical pathname of the parent can be determined using the /devices tree or following the link of the logical device
name:
 example# ls -l /dev/rdsk/c0t3d0s0
 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 88 Aug 22 13:29 /dev/rdsk/c0t3d0s0 ->
 ../../devices/iommu@f,e0000000/sbus@f,e0001000/espdma@f,400000/
  esp@f,800000/sd@3,0:a,raw
The register property values can be determined from prtconf(1M) output (-v option):
  esp, instance #0
  ....
    Register Specifications:
  Bus Type=0xf, Address=0x800000, Size=40
To set scsi-options more specifically per target:
 target1-scsi-options=0x78;
<beginning of page>
 device-type-scsi-options-list =
  "SEAGATE ST32550W", "seagate-scsi-options" ;
 seagate-scsi-options = 0x58;
 scsi-options=0x3f8;
The above would set scsi-options for target 1 to 0x78 and for all other targets on this SCSI bus to 0x378 except for
one specific disk type which will have scsi-options set to 0x58.
scsi-options specified per target ID has the highest precedence, followed by scsi-options per device type. To get the
inquiry string run probe-scsi or probe-scsi-all command at the ok prompt before booting the system.
Global, for example. for all esp instances, scsi-options per bus has the lowest precedence.
The system needs to be rebooted before the specified scsi-options take effect.

The messages described below are some that may appear on the system console, as well as being logged.
The first four messages may be displayed while the esp driver is trying to attach; these messages mean that the esp
driver was unable to attach. All of these messages are preceded by "esp%d", where "%d" is the instance number of
the esp controller.
Device in slave-only slot
The SBus device has been placed in a slave-only slot and will not be accessible; move to non-slave-only SBus slot.
Device is using a hilevel intr
The device was configured with an interrupt level that cannot be used with this esp driver. Check the SBus device.
Unable to map registers
Driver was unable to map device registers; check for bad hardware. Driver did not attach to device; SCSI devices
will be inaccessible.

Cannot find dma controller
Driver was unable to locate a dma controller. This is an auto-configuration error.
Disabled TQ since disconnects are disabled
Tagged queuing was disabled because disconnects were disabled in scsi-options.

The driver could not allocate another tag number. The target devices do not properly support tagged queuing.

A polled command failed because of timeouts or bus errors.
Disconnected command timeout for Target <id>.<lun>
A timeout occurred while target/lun was disconnected. This is usually a target f/w problem. For tagged queuing tar<hy>
gets, <n> commands were outstanding when the timeout was detected.
Disconnected tagged cmds (<n>) timeout for Target <id>.<lun>
A timeout occurred while target/lun was disconnected. This is usually a target f/w problem. For tagged queuing tar<hy>
gets, <n> commands were outstanding when the timeout was detected.
Connected command timeout for Target <id>.<lun>
This is usually a SCSI bus problem. Check cables and termination.
Target <id>.<lun> reverting to async. mode
A data transfer hang was detected. The driver attempts to eliminate this problem by reducing the data transfer rate.
Target <id>.<lun> reducing sync. transfer rate
A data transfer hang was detected. The driver attempts to eliminate this problem by reducing the data transfer rate.
Reverting to slow SCSI cable mode
A data transfer hang was detected. The driver attempts to eliminate this problem by reducing the data transfer rate.
Reset SCSI bus failed
An attempt to reset the SCSI bus failed.
External SCSI bus reset
Another initiator reset the SCSI bus.
The esp hardware does not support Wide SCSI mode. Only FAS-type esp's support fast SCSI (10 MB/sec).
The esp driver exports properties indicating per target the negotiated transfer speed (target<n>-sync-speed) and
whether tagged queuing has been enabled (target<n>-TQ). The sync-speed property value is the data transfer rate
in KB/sec. The target-TQ property has no value. The existence of the property indicates that tagged queuing has
been enabled. Refer to prtconf(1M) (verbose option) for viewing the esp properties.
