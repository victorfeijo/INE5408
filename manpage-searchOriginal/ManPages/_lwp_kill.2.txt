_lwp_kill <-> send a signal to a LWP
#include <sys/lwp.h>
#include <signal.h>
int _lwp_kill(lwpid_t target_lwp, int sig);
The _lwp_kill() function sends a signal to the LWP specified by target_lwp. The signal that is to be sent is specified
by sig and must be one from the list given in signal.h(3HEAD). If sig is 0 (the null signal), error checking is per<hy>
formed but no signal is actually sent. This can be used to check the validity of target_lwp.
The target_lwp must be an LWP within the same process as the calling LWP.
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. A non-zero value indicates an error.
If any of the following conditions occur, _lwp_kill() fails and returns the corresponding value:
EINVAL The sig argument is not a valid signal number.
ESRCH The target_lwp argument cannot be found in the current process.
