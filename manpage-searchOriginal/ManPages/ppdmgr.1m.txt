ppdmgr <-> utility for managing PPD files
ppdmgr -a ppd_filename_path [-L label] [-R ppd_repository_name] [-w]

The PPD File Manager adds PPD files to the print system's PPD file repositories. When changes in the PPD file
repositories are made by the utility, they are reflected in the Solaris Print Manager (see printmgr(1M)) GUI printer
driver field when adding or modifying local attached or network attached printers.
Multiple PPD file repositories may be available. PPD files that are supplied with the system are available in the "sys<hy>
tem" repository. PPD files that are supplied by third party vendors may be available in the "vendor" repository. PPD
files that are supplied by system administrators may be available in the "admin" repository, and PPD files that are
added using this utility are available in the "user" repository. When this utility is used to update or rebuild printer in<hy>
formation reflected in the printmgr(1M), the special reserved repository name "all" can be used to specify all of the
available PPD file repositories.
PPD files are grouped under a user-provided "label" within the print system's PPD file repository to allow easier se<hy>
lection of a printer driver through the printmgr GUI. The special reserved label name "all" can be used to specify
all of the available labels in a PPD file repository. The results are undefined if a label name contains characters that
are not in the portable filename character set or if a label name starts with a hyphen (-). A label name may not con<hy>
tain a semi-colon (:).
The following subcommand are supported:
-a ppd_file_path
Adds a copy of ppd_file_path to the system under the specified label in the specified repository, where ppd_file_path
is the full path and file name to the PPD file. The utility accepts a valid PPD file with either a .ppd or .ppd.gz
(gzipped) extension.
-L label
Specifies a label to group PPD files under. When specified with the -a option, the default label is "user". When spec<hy>
ified with the -r or -u option, the default label is "all". The following are reserved labels:
caches may never be specified
ppdcache may never be specified
manufaliases may never be specified
all applies the specified action to all labels in a repository, and may only be specified with the -r or -u option.
SUNW* anything starting with SUNW is reserved and should not be specified with the -a option.
-R repository_name
Specifies the name of a PPD file repository representing one of the PPD file installation locations. Possible reposito<hy>
ry names include: "user", "admin", "vendor", "system", and "all".
The repository name "all" signifies all of the possible repository names. The default repository name is "user". Only
the "user" or "admin" repository may be specified with the -a option.
-r
Rebuilds the cache information for the specified label in the specified repository.
<beginning of page>
-u
Updates the cache information for the specified label in the specified repository.
-w
Write the full path of the added PPD file. This option is only valid with the -a option. Otherwise, this option is ig<hy>
nored.
Example 1 Adding a copy of a PPD file to the repository
The following commands add a copy of a PPD file to the "user" repository under the "user" label:
 # ppdmgr -a /net/somesystem/ppdfiles/ppdfile.ppd
or
 # ppdmgr -a /net/somesystem/ppdfiles/ppdfile.ppd -L user
The following command adds a copy of a PPD file to the "user" repository under the "Photo" label and write the full
path of the added copy to standard output:
 # ppdmgr -a /net/somesystem/ppdfiles/ppdfile.ppd -L "Photo" -w
Example 2 Updating the cache for the PPD files
The following commands update the cache for the PPD files under the "all" labels in the "user" repository:
  # ppdmgr -u
or
  # ppdmgr -u -R user -L all
The following command updates the cache for the PPD files under the "photo" label in the "user" repository:
  # ppdmgr -u -R user -L Photo
Example 3 Rebuilding the cache for the PPD files
The following command rebuilds the cache for the PPD files under the "Photo" label in the "user" repository:
 # ppdmgr -r -R user -L Photo
