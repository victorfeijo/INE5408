 [-b searchbase] [-s scope] [-a deref] [-l timelimit]
 [-z sizelimit] filter [attrs]...
The ldapsearch utility opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and performs a search using the filter filter.
If ldapsearch finds one or more entries, the attributes specified by attrs are retrieved and the entries and values are
printed to standard output. If no attrs are listed, all attributes are returned.
If one or more entries are found, each entry is written to standard output in the form:
 dn: Distinguished Name (DN)
  attributename: value
  attributename: value
  attributename: value
 ...
Multiple entries are separated with a single blank line. If the -F option is used to specify a different separator charac<hy>
ter, this character is used instead of the : character. If the -t option is used, the name of a temporary file is returned in
place of the actual value. If the -A option is given, only the "attributename" is returned and not the attribute value.
The following options are supported:
-A
Retrieve attributes only (no values). This is useful when you just want to see whether an attribute is present in an en<hy>
try and are not interested in the specific value.
-a deref
Specify how aliases dereferencing is done. The possible values for deref are never, always, search, or find to speci<hy>
fy respectively that aliases are never dereferenced, always dereferenced, dereferenced when searching, or derefer<hy>
enced only when finding the base object for the search. The default is to never dereference aliases.
-B
Display non-ASCII values and use the old non-LDIF format. This option disables the default -L option.
-b searchbase
Use searchbase as the starting point for the search instead of the default.
-C pattern
Persistent search. Perform a search that keeps the connection open and displays results whenever entries matching
the scope and filter of the search are added, modified, or removed. With this option, the ldapsearch tool runs indefi<hy>
nitely; you must type Control-c to stop it. The pattern has the following format:
 ps:changeType[:changesOnly[:entryChangeControls]]
<beginning of page>
-c authzid
Specifies the getEffectiveRights control authzid. For example:
 dn:uid=bjensen,dc=example,dc=com
-D bindDN
Use the distinguished name bindDN to bind to the directory.
-d debuglevel
Set the LDAP debugging level. Useful levels of debugging for ldapsearch are:
1 Trace
2 Packets
4 Arguments
32 Filters
128 Access control
To request more than one category of debugging information, add the masks. For example, to request trace and filter
information, specify a debuglevel of 33.
-E
Ask server to expose (report) bind identity by means of authentication response control.
-e
Minimize base-64 encoding of values.
-F sep
Use sep as the field separator between attribute names and values. If this option has been specified, the -L option is
ignored.
-f file
Read a series of lines from file, performing one LDAP search for each line. In this case, the filter given on the com<hy>
mand line is treated as a pattern where the first occurrence of %s is replaced with a line from file. If file is a single -
character, then the lines are read from standard input.
-G pattern
Virtual list view. Retrieve only a portion of all results, as determined by the index or value of the search target and
the number of entries to be returned before and after the target. This option always requires the -S and -x options to
specify the sorting order on the server.
-?
Display the usage help text that briefly describes all options.
<beginning of page>
-H
Display the usage help text that briefly describes all options.
-h ldaphost
Specify an alternate host on which the secure LDAP server is running.
-i locale
Specify the character set to use for command-line input. The default is the character set specified in the LANG envi<hy>
ronment variable. You might want to use this option to perform the conversion from the specified character set to
UTF8, thus overriding the LANG setting. Using this argument, you can input the bind DN, base DN, and the search
filter pattern in the specified character set. The ldapsearch tool converts the input from these arguments before it
processes the search request. For example, -i no indicates that the bind DN, base DN, and search filter are provided
in Norwegian. This argument only affects the command-line input. If you specify a file containing a search filter
(with the -f option), ldapsearch does not convert the data in the file.
-j filename
Specify a file containing the password for the bind DN or the password for the SSL client's key database. To protect
the password, use this option in scripts and place the password in a secure file. This option is mutually exclusive of
the -w and -W options.
-J [:criticality[:value|::b64value|b64value|:fileurl]]
Criticality is a boolean value (default is false).
-k path
Specify the path to a directory containing conversion routines. These routines are used if you want to specify a lo<hy>
cale that is not supported by default by your directory server. This is for NLS support.
-L
 Display search results in LDIF format. This option also turns on the -B option. This behavior is the default.
-l timelimit
Wait at most timelimit seconds for a search to complete.
-M
Manage smart referrals. When they are the target of the operation, search the entry containing the referral instead of
the entry obtained by following the referral.
-N certificate
Specify the certificate name to use for certificate-based client authentication. For example: -N "Directory-Cert".
-n
Show what would be done, but do not actually perform the search. Useful in conjunction with -v and -d for debug<hy>
ging.
-O hopLimit
Specify the maximum number of referral hops to follow while finding an entry to modify. By default, there is no
limit.
<beginning of page>
-o attributename=value
For SASL mechanisms and other options such as security properties, mode of operation, authorization ID, authenti<hy>
cation ID, and so forth.
The different attribute names and their values are as follows:
secProp="number" For defining SASL security properties.
realm="value" Specifies SASL realm (default is realm=none).
authzid="value" Specify the authorization ID name for SASL bind.
authid="value" Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind.
mech="value" Specifies the various SASL mechanisms.
-P path
Specify the path and filename of the client's certificate database. For example:
 -P /home/uid/.netscape/cert7.db
When using the command on the same host as the directory server, you can use the server's own certificate database.
For example:
 -P installDir/lapd-serverID/alias/cert7.db
Use the -P option alone to specify server authentication only.
-p ldapport
Specify an alternate TCP port where the secure LAPD server is listening.
-R
Do not automatically follow referrals returned while searching.
-r
Display the output of the ldapsearch command in the old format.
-S [-]attribute
Specify an attribute for sorting the entries returned by the search. The sort criteria is alphabetical on the attribute's
value or reverse alphabetical with the form -attribute. You can give multiple -S options to refine the sorting, For ex<hy>
ample:
 -S sn -S givenname
By default, the entries are not sorted. Use the -x option to perform server-side sorting.
<beginning of page>
-s scope
Specify the scope of the search. The possible values of scope are base, one, or sub to specify respectively a base ob<hy>
ject, one-level, or subtree search. The default is sub.
-T
Format the output of search results so that no line breaks are used within individual attribute values.
-t
Write retrieved values to a set of temporary files. This is useful for dealing with non-ASCII values such as jpegPhoto
or audio.
-U
URL format (valid only with the -t option). When using temporary file output, the standard output of the tool in<hy>
cludes the URL of the file instead of the attributes value. For example:
 jpegPhoto:< file:/tmp/ldapsearch-jpegPhoto-YzaOMh
-u
Include the user-friendly form of the Distinguished Name (DN) in the output.
-V version
Specify the LDAP protocol version number to be used for the delete operation, either 2 or 3. LDAP v3 is the default.
Specify LDAP v2 when connecting to servers that do not support v3.
-v
Run in verbose mode, with diagnostics written to standard output.
-W password
Specify the password for the client's key database given in the -P option. This option is required for certificate-based
client authentication. Specifying password on the command line has security issues because the password can be
seen by others on the system by means of the ps command. Use the -j instead to specify the password from the file.
This option is mutually exclusive of -j.
-w passwd
Use passwd as the password for authentication to the directory. When you use -w passwd to specify the password to
be used for authentication, the password is visible to other users of the system by means of the ps command, in
script files or in shell history. If you use the ldapsearch command without this option, the command prompts for the
password and read it from standard in. When used without the -w option, the password is not visible to other users.
-x
Use with the -S option to specify that search results be sorted on the server rather than by the ldapsearch command
running on the client. This is useful if you want to sort according to a matching rule, as with an international search.
It is usually faster to sort on the server, if that is supported, rather than on the client.
-Y proxyDN
Specify the proxy DN (proxied authorization id) to use for the modify operation, usually in double quotes (" ") for
the shell.
<beginning of page>
-Z
Specify that SSL be used to provide certificate-based client authentication. This option requires the -N and SSL
password and any other of the SSL options needed to identify the certificate and the key database.
-z sizelimit
Retrieve at most sizelimit entries for a search to complete.
Example 1 Performing a Subtree Search
The following command performs a subtree search (using the default search base) for entries with a commonName
of "mark smith". The commonName and telephoneNumber values is retrieved and printed to standard output. Use
the -r option to display this output in the old format.
 example% ldapsearch "cn=mark smith" cn telephoneNumber
The output looks something like this:
 dn: Mark D Smith, ou=Sales, ou=Atlanta, ou=People, o=XYZ, c=US
 cn: Mark Smith
 cn: Mark David Smith
 cn: Mark D Smith 1
 cn: Mark D Smith
 telephoneNumber: +1 123 456-7890
 dn: Mark C Smith, ou=Distribution, ou=Atlanta, ou=People, o=XYZ, c=US
 cn: Mark Smith
 cn: Mark C Smith 1
 cn: Mark C Smith
 telephoneNumber: +1 123 456-9999
Example 2 Performing a Subtree Search Using the Default Search Base
The following command performs a subtree search using the -r option to display in old style format with a default
search base for entries with user id of mcs. The user-friendly form of the entry's DN is output after the line that con<hy>
tains the DN itself, and the jpegPhoto and audio values are retrieved and written to temporary files.
 ldapsearch -r -u -t "uid=mcs" -r jpegPhoto audio
The output might look like this if one entry with one value for each of the requested attributes is found:
 cn=Mark C Smith, ou=Distribution, ou=Atlanta, ou=People, o=XYZ, c=US
 Mark C Smith, Distribution, Atlanta, People, XYZ, US
 audio=/tmp/ldapsearch-audio-a19924
 jpegPhoto=/tmp/ldapsearch-jpegPhoto-a19924
Example 3 Performing a One-Level Search
The following command performs a one-level search at the c=US level for all organizations whose organization<hy>
Name begins with XY.
 example% ldapsearch -s one -b "c=US" "o=XY*" o description
<beginning of page>
The organizationName and description attribute values are retrieved and printed to standard output, resulting in
output similar to this:
 dn: o=XYZ c=US
  o: XYZ
  description: XYZ Corporation
  dn: o="XY Trading Company", c=US
  o: XY Trading Company
  description: Import and export specialists
  dn: o=XYInternational, c=US
  o: XYInternational
  o: XYI
  o: XY International
Example 4 Performing a Subtree Search on an IPv6 Server
The following command performs a subtree search using the default search base for entries with a user id of mcs on
an IPv6 (that is, -h) server:
 example% ldapsearch -u -h '['fec0::111:a00:20ff:fea3:edcf']' \
  -t "uid=mcs" jpegPhoto audio
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred. A diagnostic message is written to standard error.
