mkdevalloc <-> Make device_allocate entries
/usr/sbin/mkdevalloc
The mkdevalloc command writes to standard out a set of device_allocate(4) entries describing the system's frame
buffer, audio and removable media devices.
The mkdevalloc command is used by the init.d(4) scripts to create or update the /etc/security/device_allocate file.
Entries are generated based on the device special files found in /dev. For the different categories of devices, the
mkdevalloc command checks for the following files under /dev:
 audio /dev/audio, /dev/audioctl, /dev/sound/...
 tape /dev/rst*, /dev/nrst*, /dev/rmt/...
 floppy /dev/diskette, /dev/fd*, /dev/rdiskette, /dev/rfd*
 removable disk /dev/sr*, /dev/nsr*, /dev/dsk/c0t?d0s?, /dev/rdsk/c0t?d0s?
 frame buffer /dev/fb
All entries set the device-minimum and device-maximum fields to the hex representations of ADMIN_LOW and
ADMIN_HIGH, respectively. The device-authorization field is set to solaris.device.allocate, except for the frame<hy>
buffer entry, where it is set to *. The device-name, device-type and device-clean fields are set to the following val<hy>
ues:
  device-name device-type device-clean
 audio audio audio audio_clean_wrapper
 tape mag_tape_0,1,... st st_clean
 floppy floppy_0,1,... fd disk_clean
 removable disk cdrom_0,1,... sr disk_clean
