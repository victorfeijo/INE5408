wchar.h, wchar <-> wide-character handling
#include <wchar.h>
The <wchar.h> header defines the following types:
wchar_t As described in <stddef.h>.
wint_t An integer type capable of storing any valid value of wchar_t or WEOF.
wctype_t A scalar type of a data object that can hold values which represent locale-specific character classification.
mbstate_t An object type other than an array type that can hold the conversion state information necessary to con<hy>
vert between sequences of (possibly multi-byte) characters and wide characters. If a codeset is being used such that
an mbstate_t needs to preserve more than two levels of reserved state, the results are unspecified.
FILE As described in <stdio.h>.
size_t As described in <stddef.h>.
va_list As described in <stdarg.h>.
The implementation supports one or more programming environments in which the width of wint_t is no greater
than the width of type long. The names of these programming environments can be obtained using the confstr(3C)
function or the getconf(1) utility.
The <wchar.h> header defines the following macros:
WCHAR_MAX The maximum value representable by an object of type wchar_t.
WCHAR_MIN The minimum value representable by an object of type wchar_t.
WEOF Constant expression of type wint_t that is returned by several WP functions to indicate end-of-file.
NULL As described in <stddef.h>.
The tag tm is declared as naming an incomplete structure type, the contents of which are described in the header
<time.h>.
Inclusion of the <wchar.h> header can make visible all symbols from the headers <ctype.h>, <string.h>,
<stdarg.h>, <stddef.h>, <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, and <time.h>.
