nl_langinfo <-> language information
#include <langinfo.h>
char *nl_langinfo(nl_item item);
The nl_langinfo() function returns a pointer to a null-terminated string containing information relevant to a particu<hy>
lar language or cultural area defined in the programs locale. The manifest constant names and values of item are de<hy>
fined by <langinfo.h>. For example:
nl_langinfo (ABDAY_1);
would return a pointer to the string "Dim" if the identified language was French and a French locale was correctly
installed; or "Sun" if the identified language was English.
If setlocale(3C) has not been called successfully, or if data for a supported language is either not available, or if item
is not defined therein, then nl_langinfo() returns a pointer to the corresponding string in the C locale. In all locales,
nl_langinfo() returns a pointer to an empty string if item contains an invalid setting.
The nl_langinfo() function can be used safely in multithreaded applications, as long as setlocale(3C) is not being
called to change the locale.

The array pointed to by the return value should not be modified by the program. Subsequent calls to nl_langinfo()
may overwrite the array.
