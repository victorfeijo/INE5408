raise <-> send a signal to the executing thread
#include <signal.h>
int raise(int sig);
The raise() function sends the signal sig to the executing thread. If a signal handler is called, the raise function does
not return until after the signal handler returns.
The effect of the raise function is equivalent to calling:
 pthread_kill(pthread_self(), sig);
See the pthread_kill(3C) manual page for a detailed list of failure conditions and the signal.h(3HEAD) manual
page for a list of signals.
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. Otherwise, <mi>1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
