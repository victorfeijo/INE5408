OM_uint32 gss_import_name(OM_uint32 * minor_status,
 const gss_buffer_t input_name_buffer, const gss_OID input_name_type,
 gss_name_t *output_name);
The gss_import_name() function converts a contiguous string name to internal form. In general, the internal name
returned by means of the output_name parameter will not be a mechanism name; the exception to this is if the in<hy>
put_name_type indicates that the contiguous string provided by means of the input_name_buffer parameter is of type
GSS_C_NT_EXPORT_NAME, in which case, the returned internal name will be a mechanism name for the mech<hy>
anism that exported the name.
The parameter descriptions for gss_import_name() follow:
minor_status Status code returned by the underlying mechanism.
input_name_buffer The gss_buffer_desc structure containing the name to be imported.
input_name_type A gss_OID that specifies the format that the input_name_buffer is in.
output_name The gss_name_t structure to receive the returned name in internal form. Storage associated with this
name must be freed by the application after use with a call to gss_release_name().
The gss_import_name() function may return the following status codes:
GSS_S_COMPLETE The gss_import_name() function completed successfully.
GSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE The input_name_type was unrecognized.
GSS_S_BAD_NAME The input_name parameter could not be interpreted as a name of the specified type.
GSS_S_BAD_MECH The input_name_type was GSS_C_NT_EXPORT_NAME, but the mechanism contained
within the input_name is not supported.
GSS_S_FAILURE The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific GSS status code is defined.
The mechanism-specific status code reported by means of the minor_status parameter details the error condition.
