int32_t csx_ReleaseConfiguration(client_handle_t ch, release_config_t *rc);
Solaris DDI Specific (Solaris DDI)
ch Client handle returned from csx_RegisterClient(9F).
rc Pointer to a release_config_t structure.
This function returns a PC Card and socket to a simple memory only interface and sets the card to configuration ze<hy>
ro by writing a 0 to the PC card's COR (Configuration Option Register).
Card Services may remove power from the socket if no clients have indicated their usage of the socket by an active
csx_RequestConfiguration(9F) or csx_RequestWindow(9F).
Card Services is prohibited from resetting the PC Card and is not required to cycle power through zero (0) volts.
After calling csx_ReleaseConfiguration() any resources requested via the request functions csx_RequestIO(9F),
csx_RequestIRQ(9F), or csx_RequestWindow(9F) that are no longer needed should be returned to Card Services
via the corresponding csx_ReleaseIO(9F), csx_ReleaseIRQ(9F), or csx_ReleaseWindow(9F) functions. csx_Re<hy>
leaseConfiguration() must be called to release the current card and socket configuration before releasing any re<hy>
sources requested by the driver via the request functions named above.
The structure members of release_config_t are:
 uint32_t Socket; /* socket number */
The Socket field is not used in Solaris, but for portability with other Card Services implementations, it should be set
to the logical socket number.
CS_SUCCESS Successful operation.
CS_BAD_HANDLE Client handle is invalid or csx_RequestConfiguration(9F) not done.
CS_BAD_SOCKET Error getting or setting socket hardware parameters.
CS_NO_CARD No PC card in socket.
CS_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION No PCMCIA hardware installed.
This function may be called from user or kernel context.
