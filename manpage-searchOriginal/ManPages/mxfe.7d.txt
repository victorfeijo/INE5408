mxfe <-> MXFE Fast Ethernet device driver
/dev/mxfe*
The mxfe is a Solaris STREAMS hardware driver supporting the Data Link Provider Interface (dlpi(7P)) over the
Macronix 98715 family (including the Lite-On PNIC-II) of Fast Ethernet controllers.
The mxfe driver supports both style 1 and style 2 modes of operation. Physical points of attachment (PPAs) are in<hy>
terpreted as the instance number of the mxfe controller as assigned by the operating system.
The relevant fields returned as part of a DL_INFO_ACK response are: <bu> Maximum SDU is 1500. <bu> Minimum
SDU is 0. <bu> DLSAP address length is 8. <bu> MAC type is DL_ETHER. <bu> SAP length value is -2, meaning the physi<hy>
cal address component is followed immediately by a 2-byte SAP component within the DLSAP address. <bu> Service
mode is DL_CLDLS. <bu> Broadcast address value is the 6-byte Ethernet/IEEE broadcast address (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff).
If the SAP provided is zero, IEEE 802.3 mode is assumed and outbound frames will have the frame payload length
written into the type field Likewise, inbound frames with a SAP between zero and 1500 are interpreted as IEEE
802.3 frames and delivered to streams that have bound to SAP zero (the 802.3 SAP).
