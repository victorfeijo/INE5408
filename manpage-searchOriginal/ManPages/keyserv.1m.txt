keyserv <-> server for storing private encryption keys
keyserv [-c] [-d | -e] [-D] [-n] [-s sizespec]
keyserv is a daemon that is used for storing the private encryption keys of each user logged into the system. These
encryption keys are used for accessing secure network services such as secure NFS and NIS+.
Normally, root's key is read from the file /etc/.rootkey when the daemon is started. This is useful during power-fail
reboots when no one is around to type a password.
keyserv does not start up if the system does not have a secure rpc domain configured. Set up the domain name by
using the /usr/bin/domainname command. Usually the svc:/system/identity:domain service reads the domain
from /etc/defaultdomain. Invoking the domainname command without arguments tells you if you have a domain
set up.
The /etc/default/keyserv file contains the following default parameter settings. See .
ENABLE_NOBODY_KEYS Specifies whether default keys for nobody are used. ENABLE_NO<hy>
BODY_KEYS=NO is equivalent to the -d command-line option. The default value for ENABLE_NO<hy>
BODY_KEYS is YES.
The following options are supported:
-c Do not use disk caches. This option overrides any -s option.
-D Run in debugging mode and log all requests to keyserv.
-d Disable the use of default keys for nobody. See .
-e Enable the use of default keys for nobody. This is the default behavior. See .
-n Root's secret key is not read from /etc/.rootkey. Instead, keyserv prompts the user for the password to decrypt
root's key stored in the publickey database and then stores the decrypted key in /etc/.rootkey for future use. This
option is useful if the /etc/.rootkey file ever gets out of date or corrupted.
-s sizespec Specify the size of the extended Diffie-Hellman common key disk caches. The sizespec can be one of the
following forms:
mechtype=size size is an integer specifying the maximum number of entries in the cache, or an integer immediately
followed by the letter M, denoting the maximum size in MB.
size This form of sizespec applies to all caches.
See nisauthconf(1M) for mechanism types. Note that the des mechanism, AUTH_DES, does not use a disk cache.
/etc/.rootkey
/etc/default/keyserv Contains default settings. You can use command-line options to override these settings.

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
NIS+ to LDAP are available in the current Solaris release. For more information, visit http://www.sun.com/directo<hy>

The keyserv service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/network/rpc/keyserv:default
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). The service's status can be queried using the svcs(1) command.
