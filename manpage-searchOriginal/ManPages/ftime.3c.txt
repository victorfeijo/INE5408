#include <sys/timeb.h>
int ftime(struct timeb *tp);
The ftime() function sets the time and millitm members of the timeb structure pointed to by tp. The structure is de<hy>
fined in <sys/timeb.h> and contains the following members:
 time_t time;
 unsigned short millitm;
 short timezone;
 short dstflag;
The time and millitm members contain the seconds and milliseconds portions, respectively, of the current time in
seconds since 00:00:00 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), January 1, 1970.
The timezone member contains the local time zone. The dstflag member contains a flag that, if non-zero, indicates
that Daylight Saving time applies locally during the appropriate part of the year.
The contents of the timezone and dstflag members of tp after a call to ftime() are unspecified.
Upon successful completion, the ftime() function returns 0. Otherwise <mi>1 is returned.
No errors are defined.
For portability to implementations conforming to earlier versions of this document, time(2) is preferred over this
function.
The millisecond value usually has a granularity greater than one due to the resolution of the system clock. Depend<hy>
ing on any granularity (particularly a granularity of one) renders code non-portable.
