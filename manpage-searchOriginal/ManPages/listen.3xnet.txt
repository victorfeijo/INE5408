int listen(int socket, int backlog);
The listen() function marks a connection-mode socket, specified by the socket argument, as accepting connections,
and limits the number of outstanding connections in the socket's listen queue to the value specified by the backlog
argument.
If listen() is called with a backlog argument value that is less than 0, the function sets the length of the socket's listen
queue to 0.
The implementation may include incomplete connections in the queue subject to the queue limit. The implementa<hy>
tion may also increase the specified queue limit internally if it includes such incomplete connections in the queue
subject to this limit.
Implementations may limit the length of the socket's listen queue. If backlog exceeds the implementation-dependent
maximum queue length, the length of the socket's listen queue will be set to the maximum supported value.
The socket in use may require the process to have appropriate privileges to use the listen() function.
Upon successful completions, listen() returns 0. Otherwise, <mi>1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
The listen() function will fail if:
EBADF The socket argument is not a valid file descriptor.
EDESTADDRREQ The socket is not bound to a local address, and the protocol does not support listening on an un<hy>
bound socket.
EINVAL The socket is already connected.
ENOTSOCK The socket argument does not refer to a socket.
EOPNOTSUPP The socket protocol does not support listen().
The listen() function may fail if:
EACCES The calling process does not have the appropriate privileges.
EINVAL The socket has been shut down.
ENOBUFS Insufficient resources are available in the system to complete the call.
