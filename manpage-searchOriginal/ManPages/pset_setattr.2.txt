pset_setattr, pset_getattr <-> set or get processor set attributes
#include <sys/pset.h>
int pset_setattr(psetid_t pset, uint_t attr);
int pset_getattr(psetid_t pset, uint_t *attr);
The pset_setattr() function sets attributes of the processor set specified by pset. The bitmask of attributes to be set
or cleared is specified by attr.
The pset_getattr function returns attributes of the processor set specified by pset. On successful return, attr will con<hy>
tain the bitmask of attributes for the specified processor set.
The value of the attr argument is the bitwise inclusive-OR of these attributes, defined in <sys/pset.h>:
PSET_NOESCAPE Unbinding of LWPs from the processor set with this attribute requires the
{PRIV_SYS_RES_CONFIG} privilege to be asserted in the effective set of the calling process.
The binding of LWPs and processes to processor sets is controlled by pset_bind(2). When the PSET_NOESCAPE
attribute is cleared, a process calling pset_bind() can clear the processor set binding of any LWP whose real or ef<hy>
fective user ID matches its own real of effective user ID. Setting PSET_NOESCAPE attribute forces pset_bind()
to requires the {PRIV_SYS_RES_CONFIG} privilege to be asserted in the effective set of the calling process.
Upon successful completion, these functions return 0. Otherwise, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
These function will fail if:
EFAULT The location pointed to by attr was not writable by the user.
EINVAL An invalid processor set ID was specified.
The caller is in a non-global zone, the pools facility is active, and the processor is not a member of the zone's pool's
processor set.
ENOTSUP The pools facility is active. See pooladm(1M) and pool_set_status(3POOL) for information about en<hy>
abling and disabling the pools facility.
