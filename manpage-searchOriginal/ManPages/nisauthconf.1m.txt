nisauthconf <-> configure NIS+ security
nisauthconf [-v] [mechanism,]...
nisauthconf controls which authentication flavors NIS+ should use when communicating with other NIS+ clients
and servers. If the command is not executed, then NIS+ will default to the AUTH_DES authentication flavor when
running security level 2. See rpc.nisd(1M).
nisauthconf takes a list of authentication mechanism's in order of preference. An authentication mechanism may use
one or more authentication flavors listed below. If des is the only specified mechanism, then NIS+ only use
AUTH_DES with other NIS+ clients and servers. If des is the first mechanism, then other authentication mecha<hy>
nism's after des will be ignored by NIS+, except for nisaddcred(1M). After changing the mechanism configuration,
the keyserv(1M) daemon must be restarted. Note that doing so will remove encryption keys stored by the running
keyserv process. This means that a reboot usually is the safest option when the mechanism configuration has been
changed.
The following mechanisms are available:
tab() box; cw(2.75i) |cw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) |lw(2.75i) Authentication mechanismAuthentication Flavor _ de<hy>
sAUTH_DES _ dh640-0T{ RPCSEC_GSS using 640-bit Diffie-Hellman keys T} _ dh1024-0T{ RPCSEC_GSS
using 1024-bit Diffie-Hellman keys T}
If no mechanisms are specified, then a list of currently configured mechanisms is printed.
-v Displays a verbose table listing the currently configured authentication mechanisms.
Example 1 Configuring a System with only RPCSEC_GSS Authentication Flavor
To configure a system to use only the RPCSEC_GSS authentication flavor with 640-bit Diffie-Hellman keys, ex<hy>
ecute the following as root:
 example# /usr/lib/nis/nisauthconf dh640-0
Example 2 Configuring a System with both RPCSEC_GSS and AUTH_DES Authentication Flavors
To configure a system to use both RPCSEC_GSS (with 640-bit Diffie-Hellman keys) and AUTH_DES authentica<hy>
tion flavors:
 example# /usr/lib/nis/nisauthconf dh640-0 des
Example 3 Transitioning to Other Authentication Flavors
The following example can be used while adding credentials for a new mechanism before NIS+ is authenticating
with the new mechanism:
 example# /usr/lib/nis/nisauthconf des dh640-0
Note that except for nisaddcred(1M), NIS+ will not use mechanisms that follow 'des.'
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.

A NIS+ client of a server that is configured for either dh640-0 or dh1024-0 must run Solaris 7 or later, even if the
server is also configured with des.
NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
NIS+ to LDAP are available in the current Solaris release. For more information, visit http://www.sun.com/directo<hy>
