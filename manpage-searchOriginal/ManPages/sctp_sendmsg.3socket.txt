ssize_t sctp_sendmsg(int s, const void *msg, size_t len,

The sctp_sendmsg() function sends a message from the SCTP endpoint s.
In addition to specifying msg as the message buffer and len as the length of the buffer, the following parameters can
be set:
to Destination address
tolen Length of the destination address
ppid Application-specified payload protocol identifier
stream_no Target stream for the message
timetolive Time period in milliseconds after which the message expires if transmission for the message has not been
started. A value of 0 indicates that the message does not expire. When the MSG_PR_SCTP flag is set the message
expires, even if transmission has started, unless the entire message is transmitted within the timetolive period.
context Value returned when an error occurs in sending a message
The flags parameter is formed from the bitwise OR of zero or more of the following flags:
MSG_UNORDERED This flag requests un-ordered delivery of the message. If this flag is clear the message is con<hy>
sidered an ordered send.
MSG_ABORT When set, this flag causes the specified association to abort by sending an ABORT to the peer. The
flag is used only for one-to-many style SCTP socket associations.
MSG_EOF When set, this flag invokes a graceful shutdown on a specified association. The flag is used only for
one-to-many style SCTP socket associations.
MSG_PR_SCTP This flag indicates that the message is treated as partially reliable. The message expires unless the
entire message is successfully transmitted within the time period specified in the timetolive parameter.
MSG_PR_SCTP implements timed reliability service for SCTP messages. As yet, no common standard has been
defined for the service and the interface is considered unstable.
The initial call to sctp_sendmsg() can be used to create an association, but it cannot be used subsequently on an ex<hy>
isting association. Since sctp_sendmsg() always uses 0 internally as the association ID, it is not suitable for use on
one-to-many sockets.
Upon successful completion, the sctp_sendmsg() function returns the number of bytes sent. The function returns -1
if an error occurs.
The sctp_sendmsg() function will fail if:
<beginning of page>
EBADF The s argument is an invalid file descriptor.
ENOTSOCK The s argument is not a socket.
EOPNOTSUPP MSG_OOB is set as a flag.
EOPNOTSUPP MSG_ABORT or MSG_EOF is set on a one-to-one style SCTP socket.
EPIPE The socket is shutting down and no more writes are allowed.
EAGAIN The socket is non-blocking and the transmit queue is full.
ENOTCONN There is no established association.
EINVAL Control message length is incorrect.
EINVAL Specified destination address does not belong to the association.
EAFNOSUPPORT Address family of the specified destination address is other than AF_INET or AF_INET6.
