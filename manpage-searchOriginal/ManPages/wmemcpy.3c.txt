wmemcpy <-> copy wide-characters in memory
#include <wchar.h>
wchar_t *wmemcpy(wchar_t *ws1, const wchar_t *ws2, size_t n);
The wmemcpy() function copies n wide-characters from the object pointed to by ws2 to the object pointed to be
ws1. This function is not affected by locale and all wchar_t values are treated identically. The null wide-character
and wchar_t values not corresponding to valid characters are not treated specially.
If n is zero, ws1 and ws2 must be a valid pointers, and the function copies zero wide-characters.
The wmemcpy() function returns the value of ws1.
No errors are defined.
