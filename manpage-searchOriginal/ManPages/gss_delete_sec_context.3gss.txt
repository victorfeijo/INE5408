OM_uint32 gss_delete_sec_context(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
 gss_ctx_id_t *context_handle,gss_buffer_t output_token);
Use the gss_delete_sec_context() function to delete a security context. The gss_delete_sec_context() function will
delete the local data structures associated with the specified security context. You may not obtain further security
services that use the context specified by context_handle.
In addition to deleting established security contexts, gss_delete_sec_context() will delete any half-built security
contexts that result from incomplete sequences of calls to gss_init_sec_context(3GSS) and gss_accept_sec_con<hy>
text(3GSS).
The Solaris implementation of the GSS-API retains the output_token parameter for compatibility with version 1 of
the GSS-API. Both peer applications should invoke gss_delete_sec_context(), passing the value
GSS_C_NO_BUFFER to the output_token parameter; this indicates that no token is required. If the application
passes a valid buffer to gss_delete_sec_context(), it will return a zero-length token, indicating that no token should
be transferred by the application.
The parameter descriptions for gss_delete_sec_context() follow:
minor_status A mechanism specific status code.
context_handle Context handle identifying specific context to delete. After deleting the context, the GSS-API will
set context_handle to GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT.
output_token A token to be sent to remote applications that instructs them to delete the context.
gss_delete_sec_context() may return the following status codes:
GSS_S_COMPLETE Successful completion.
GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT No valid context was supplied.
GSS_S_FAILURE The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific GSS status code is defined.
The mechanism-specific status code reported by means of the minor_status parameter details the error condition.
