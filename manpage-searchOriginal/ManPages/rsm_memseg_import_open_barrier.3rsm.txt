The rsm_memseg_import_open_barrier() and rsm_memseg_import_close_barrier() functions provide a means
of remote memory access error detection when the barrier mode is set to RSM_BARRIER_MODE_EXPLICIT.
Open and close barrier operations define a span-of-time interval for error detection. A successful close barrier guar<hy>
antees that remote memory access covered between the open barrier and close barrier have completed successfully.
Any individual failures which may have occured between the open barrier and close barrier occur without any notifi<hy>
cation and the failure is not reported until the close barrier.
The rsm_memseg_import_order_barrier() function imposes the order-of-write completion whereby, with an order
barrier, the write operations issued before the order barrier are all completed before the operations after the order
barrier. Effectively, with the order barrier call, all writes within one barrier scope are ordered with respect to those in
another barrier scope.
Upon successful completion, these functions return 0. Otherwise, an error value is returned to indicate the error.
The rsm_memseg_import_open_barrier(), rsm_memseg_import_order_barrier(), and rsm_memseg_im<hy>
port_close_barrier() functions can return the following errors:
RSMERR_BAD_SEG_HNDL Invalid segment handle
RSMERR_BAD_BARRIER_PTR Invalid barrier pointer.
The rsm_memseg_close_barrier() and rsm_memseg_order_barrier() functions can return the following errors:
RSMERR_BARRIER_UNINITIALIZED
Barrier not initialized.
RSMERR_BARRIER_NOT_OPENED
Barrier not opened.
RSMERR_BARRIER_FAILURE
Memory access error.
RSMERR_CONN_ABORTED
Connection aborted.
