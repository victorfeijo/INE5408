The calling process must have PRIV_SYS_TRANS_LABEL in its set of effective privileges to translate labels or
clearances that dominate the current process' sensitivity label.
display The structure controlling the connection to an X Window System display.
senslabel The sensitivity label to be translated.
clearance The clearance to be translated.
width The width of the translated label or clearance in pixels. If the specified width is shorter than the full label, the
label is clipped and the presence of clipped letters is indicated by an arrow. In this example, letters have been clipped
to the right of: TS<-. See the sbltos(3TSOL) manual page for more information on the clipped indicator. If the spec<hy>
ified width is equal to the display width (display), the label is not truncated, but word-wrapped using a width of half
the display width.
fontlist A list of fonts and character sets where each font is associated with a character set.
flags The value of flags indicates which words in the label_encodings(4) file are used for the translation. See the
bltos(3TSOL) manual page for a description of the flag values: LONG_WORDS, SHORT_WORDS,
LONG_CLASSIFICATION, SHORT_CLASSIFICATION, ALL_ENTRIES, ACCESS_RELATED,
VIEW_EXTERNAL, VIEW_INTERNAL, NO_CLASSIFICATION. BRACKETED is an additional flag that
can be used with Xbsltos() only. It encloses the sensitivity label in square brackets as follows: [C].
These functions return a compound string that represents the character-coded form of the sensitivity label or clear<hy>
ance that is translated. The compound string uses the language and fonts specified in fontlist and is clipped to width.
These functions return NULL if the label or clearance is not a valid, required type as defined in the label_encod<hy>
ings(4) file, or not dominated by the process' sensitivity label and the PRIV_SYS_TRANS_LABEL privilege is not
asserted.

Example 1 Translate and Clip a Clearance.
This example translates a clearance to text using the long words specified in the label_encodings(4) file, a font list,
and clips the translated clearance to a width of 72 pixels.
