ehci <-> Enhanced host controller driver
usb@unit-address
The ehci driver is a USBA (Solaris USB Architecture) compliant nexus driver that supports the Enhanced Host Con<hy>
troller Interface Specification 2.0, an industry standard developed by Intel.
A USB 2.0 host controller includes one high-speed host controller and zero or more USB 1.1 host controllers. The
high-speed host controller implements an EHCI (Enhanced Host Controller Interface) that is used for all high-speed
communications to high-speed-mode devices.
All USB 2.0 devices connected to the root ports of the USB 2.0 host controller and all devices connected to a high-
speed-mode hub should be routed to the EHCI host controller.
All full- and low-speed devices connected to the root ports of the USB 2.0 host controller should be routed to the
companion USB 1.1 host controllers. (OHCI or UHCI host controller).
The ehci supports bulk, interrupt, control and iso chronous transfers (on USB1.x devices behind a USB2.0 hub).

In addition to being logged, the following messages may appear on the system console. All messages are formatted
in the following manner:
 WARNING: <device path> (ehci<instance number>): Message...
<beginning of page>
Unrecoverable USB hardware error.
There was an unrecoverable USB hardware error reported by the ehci controller. Reboot the system. If this problem
persists, contact your system vendor.
No SOF interrupts.

No SOF interrupts have been received. This USB EHCI controller is unusable.
Error recovery failure: Please hotplug the 2.0 hub at <device path>.
The driver failed to clear 2.0 hub's TT buffer. Remove and reinsert the external USB2.0 hub.
Revision<xx> is not supported.
High speed USB devices prior to revision 0.95 are not supported.
The following messages may be entered into the system log. They are formatted in the following manner:
 <device path> (ehci<instance number>): Message...
Unable to take control from BIOS. Failure is ignored.
The driver was unable to take control of the EHCI hardware from the system's BIOS. This failure is ignored. To
abort the attach on this take-over failure, comment out a property in ehci.conf. (x86 only).
Unable to take control from BIOS.
The driver is unable to take control of the EHCI hardware from the system's BIOS and aborts the attach. High
speed (USB 2.0) support is disabled. In this case, all USB devices run at full/low speed. Contact your system vendor
or your system administror for possible changes in BIOS settings. You can disable a property in ehci.conf to ignore
this failure. (x86 only.)
Low speed device is not supported.
Full speed device is not supported.
The driver detected a low or full speed device on its root hub port. Per USB 2.0 specification, the device should be
routed to a companion host controller (OHCI or UHCI). However, no attached companion host controller appears to
be available. Therefore, low and full speed devices are not supported.
Low speed endpoint's poll interval of <n> ms is below threshold. Rounding up to 8 ms.
Low speed endpoints are limited to polling intervals between 8 ms and 255 ms. If a device reports a polling interval
that is less than 8 ms, the driver uses 8 ms instead.
Low speed endpoint's poll interval is greater than 255 ms.
The low speed device's polling interval is out of range. The host controller does not allocate bandwidth for this de<hy>
vice. This device is not usable.
Full speed endpoint's poll interval must be between 1 and 255 ms.
The full speed device's polling interval is out of range. The host controller does not allocate bandwidth for this de<hy>
vice. This device is not usable.
High speed endpoint's poll interval must be between 1 and 16 units.
The high speed device's polling interval is out of range. The host controller will not allocate bandwidth for this de<hy>

vice. This device will not be usable. Refer to the USB specification, revision 2.0 for the unit definition.
ehci_modify_qh_status_bit: Failed to halt qh=<address>.
Error recovery failed. Please disconnect and reinsert all devices or reboot.
Note -
Due to recently discovered incompatibilities with this USB controller, USB2.x transfer support has been disabled.
However, this device continues to function as a USB1.x controller. Information on enabling USB2.x support is pro<hy>
vided in this man page. Please refer to www.sun.com/io for Solaris Ready products and to www.sun.com/bigad<hy>
min/hcl for additional compatible USB products. VIA chips may not be compatible with this driver. To bind ehci
specifically to the chip and eliminate the warnings, and to enable USB2.x suppport, a new, more specific driver alias
(refer to add_drv(1M) and update_drv(1M)) must be specified for ehci. By default, the ehci alias is 'pci<hy>
class,0c0320.' The compatible names in the prtconf(1M) output provides additional aliases. For example:
  # prtconf -vp | grep pciclass,0c0320
  compatible: 'pci1106,3104.1106.3104.2063' +
 'pci1106,3104.1106.3104' + 'pci1106,3104' +
  pci1106,3104.2063' + 'pci1106,3104' + 'pciclass,0c0320' +
 'pciclass,0c03'
  ....
  A more specific alias is 'pci1106,3104.' Perform the follow-
  ing step to add this alias, then reboot the system:
  # update_drv -a -i '"pci1106,3104"' ehci
  # reboot
After you apply the above workaround, the following message is displayed in your system log:
