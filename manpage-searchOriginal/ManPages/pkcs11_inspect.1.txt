pkcs11_inspect <-> print certificate contents
/usr/lib/pam_pkcs11/pkcs11_inspect [debug] [config_file=filename]
pkcs11_inspect uses the pam_pkcs11 library infrastructure to obtain the content of a certificate and display it.
pkcs11_inspect uses the same configuration file and arguments as the pam_pkcs11(5) PAM module. It loads de<hy>
fined mapper modules, and uses them to look into the certificate for required entries, that is, ms_mapper looks for
ms UPN entries, and so forth.
When a mapper module finds a proper entry in the certificate, it converts to UTF-8 and prints it to stdout.
The following options are supported:
config_file=fileame Set the configuration file. The default value is /etc/security/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf.
debug Enable debugging output.
As it uses the same configuration file as pam_pkcs11(5), all of the pam_pkcs11 options are available. Some of
these options make no sense in a non-PAM environment, and are therefore ignored. Some mapper options (mapfile,
ignorecase) have no effect on certificate contents, and they are ignored as well.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
pkcs11_inspect prints on stdout all certificate contents that are found for mappers.
1 An error occurred.
Example 1 Using pkcs_inspect
The following example runs the pkcs_inspect command without any options:
 % pkcs11_inspect
Example 2 Using pkcs_inspect with Options
The following example runs the pkcs_inspect command with options:
 % pkcs11_inspect debug config_file=${HOME}/.pam_pkcs11.conf
/etc/security/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf
