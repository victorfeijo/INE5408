mega_sas <-> SCSI HBA driver for LSI MegaRAID SAS controller
The mega_sas MegaRAID controller host bus adapter driver is a SCSA-compliant nexus driver that supports the
Dell PERC 5/E, 5/i, 6/E and 6/i RAID controllers, the IBM ServeRAID-MR10k SAS/SATA controller and the LSI
MegaRAID SAS/SATA 8308ELP, 8344ELP, 84016E, 8408ELP, 8480ELP, 8704ELP, 8704EM2, 8708ELP,
8708EM2, 8880EM2 and 8888ELP series of controllers.
Supported RAID features include RAID levels 0, 1, 5, and 6, RAID spans 10, 50 and 60, online capacity expansion
(OCE), online RAID level migration (RLM), auto resume after loss of system power during arrays, array rebuild or
reconstruction (RLM) and configurable stripe size up to 1MB. Additional supported RAID features include check
consistency for background data integrity, patrol read for media scanning and repairing, 64 logical drive support, up
to 64TB LUN support, automatic rebuild and global and dedicated hot spare support.
The mega_sas.conf file contains no user configurable parameters. Please configure your hardware through the relat<hy>
ed BIOS utility or the MegaCli configuration utility. If you want to install to a drive attached to a mega_sas HBA,
you should create the virtual drive first from the BIOS before running the Solaris install. You can obtain the MegaCli
utility from the LSI website.
The mega_sas device can support up to 64 virtual disks. Note that BIOS numbers the virtual disks as 1 through 64,
however in the Solaris operating environment virtual disks are numbered from 0 to 63. Also note that SAS and SA<hy>
TA drives cannot be configured into the same virtual disk.
The mega_sas driver does not support the LSI MegaRAID SAS 8204ELP, 8204XLP, 8208ELP, and 8208XLP con<hy>
trollers.
