tnctl provides an interface to manipulate trusted network parameters in the Solaris kernel.
As part of Solaris Trusted Extensions initialization, tnctl is run in the global zone by an smf(5) script during system
boot. The tnctl command is not intended to be used during normal system administration. Instead, if a local trusted
networking database file is modified without using the Solaris Management Console, the administrator first issues
tnchkdb(1M) to check the syntax, and then refreshes the kernel copy with this command:
 # svcadm restart svc:/network/tnctl
See WARNINGS about the risks of changing remote host and template information on a running system.
-d
Delete matching entries from the kernel. The default is to add new entries.
When deleting MLPs, the MLP range must match exactly. MLPs are specified in the form:
 port[-port]/protocol
Where port can be a number in the range 1 to 65535. or any known service (see services(4)), and protocol can be a
number in the range 1 to 255, or any known protocol (see protocols(4)).
-f
Flush all kernel entries before loading the entries that are specified on the command line. The flush does not take
place unless at least one entry parsed successfully.
-v
Turn on verbose mode.
-h host[/prefix][:template]
Update the kernel remote-host cache on the local host for the specified host or, if a template name is given, change
the kernel's cache to use the specified template. If prefix is not specified, then an implied prefix length is determined
according to the rules used for interpreting the tnrhdb. If -d is specified, then a template name cannot be specified.
-m zone:mlp:shared-mlp
Modify the kernel's multilevel port (MLP) configuration cache for the specified zone. zone specifies the zone to be
updated. mlp and shared-mlp specify the MLPs for the zone-specific and shared IP addresses. The shared-mlp field
is effective in the global zone only.
-t template[key=val[;key=val]]
Update the kernel template cache for template or, if a list of key=val pairs is given, change the kernel's cache to use
the specified entry. If -d is specified, then key=val pairs cannot be specified.
-T file
Load all template entries in file into the kernel cache.
<beginning of page>
-H file
Load all remote host entries in file into the kernel cache.
-z file
Load just the global zone's MLPs from file into the kernel cache. To reload MLPs for a non-global zone, reboot the
zone:
 # zoneadm -z non-global zone reboot

How to Synchronize Kernel Cache With Network Databases in Solaris Trusted Extensions Administrator's Proce<hy>
dures
Changing a template while the network is up can change the security view of an undetermined number of hosts.
The functionality described on this manual page is available only if the system is configured with Trusted Exten<hy>
sions.
The tnctl service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/network/tnctl
The service's status can be queried by using svcs(1). Administrative actions on this service, such as refreshing the
kernel cache, can be performed using svcadm(1M), as in:
 svcadm restart svc:/network/tnctl
