soconfig <-> configure transport providers for use by sockets
/sbin/soconfig -f file
/sbin/soconfig family type protocol [path]
The soconfig utility configures the transport provider driver for use with sockets. It specifies how the family, type,
and protocol parameters in the socket(3SOCKET) call are mapped to the name of a transport provider such as
/dev/tcp. This utility can be used to add an additional mapping or remove a previous mapping.
The init(1M) utility uses soconfig with the sock2path(4) file during the booting sequence.
The following options are supported:
-f file Set up the soconfig configuration for each driver according to the information stored in file. A soconfig file
consists of lines of at least the first three fields listed below, separated by spaces:
family type protocol path
These fields are described in the OPERANDS section below.
An example of file can be found in the EXAMPLES section below.
The following operands are supported:
family The protocol family as listed in the /usr/include/sys/socket.h file, expressed as an integer.
type The socket type as listed in the /usr/include/sys/socket.h file, expressed as an integer.
protocol The protocol number as specified in the family-specific include file, expressed as an integer. For example,
for AF_INET this number is specified in /usr/include/netinet/in.h. An unspecified protocol number is denoted with
the value zero.
module | path The module name or path name of a device that corresponds to the transport provider, such as tcp or
/dev/tcp. Modules must reside in kernel/socketmod. A device name must begin with /dev. If this parameter is spec<hy>
ified, the configuration will be added for the specified family, type, and protocol. If this parameter is not specified,
the configuration will be removed.
Example 1 Using soconfig
The following example sets up a module for family AF_INET and type SOCK_STREAM:
 example# soconfig 2 2 0 tcp
The following example sets up /dev/tcp for family AF_INET and type SOCK_STREAM:
 example# soconfig 2 2 0 /dev/tcp
The following is a sample file used with the -f option. Comment lines begin with a hash mark (#):
 # Family Type Protocol Module | Path
  2 2 0 tcp
  2 2 6 tcp
  2 1 0 udp

  2 1 17 udp
  1 2 0 /dev/ticotsord
  1 1 0 /dev/ticlts
  2 4 0 icmp
/etc/sock2path File containing mappings from sockets to transport providers.
