modlp Pointer to the Host Bus Adapters module linkage structure.
scsi_hba_init() is the system-provided initialization routine for SCSI HBA drivers. The scsi_hba_init() function
registers the HBA in the system and allows the driver to accept configuration requests on behalf of SCSI target driv<hy>
ers. The scsi_hba_init() routine must be called in the HBA's _init(9E) routine before mod_install(9F) is called. If
mod_install(9F) fails, the HBA's _init(9E) should call scsi_hba_fini() before returning failure.
scsi_hba_fini() is the system provided completion routine for SCSI HBA drivers. scsi_hba_fini() removes all of the
system references for the HBA that were created in scsi_hba_init(). The scsi_hba_fini() routine should be called in
the HBA's _fini(9E) routine if mod_remove(9F) is successful.
scsi_hba_init() returns 0 if successful, and a non-zero value otherwise. If scsi_hba_init() fails, the HBA's _init() en<hy>
try point should return the value returned by scsi_hba_init().
scsi_hba_init() and scsi_hba_fini() should be called from _init(9E) or _fini(9E), respectively.

Writing Device Drivers
The HBA is responsible for ensuring that no DDI request routines are called on behalf of its SCSI target drivers
once scsi_hba_fini() is called.
