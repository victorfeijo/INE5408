SAMESTR, samestr <-> test if next queue is in the same stream
#include <sys/stream.h>
int SAMESTR(queue_t *q);
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI).
q Pointer to the queue.
The SAMESTR() function is used to see if the next queue in a stream (if it exists) is the same type as the current
queue (that is, both are read queues or both are write queues). This function accounts for the twisted queue connec<hy>
tions that occur in a STREAMS pipe and should be used in preference to direct examination of the q_next field of
queue(9S) to see if the stream continues beyond q.
The SAMESTR() function returns 1 if the next queue is the same type as the current queue. It returns 0 if the next
queue does not exist or if it is not the same type.
The SAMESTR() function can be called from user, interrupt, context.
