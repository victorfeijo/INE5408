lprm <-> remove print requests from the print queue
/usr/ucb/lprm [-P destination] [-] [request-ID]...
 [user]...
The lprm utility removes print requests (request-ID) from the print queue.
Without arguments, lprm deletes the current print request. lprm reports the name of the file associated with print
requests that it removes. lprm is silent if there are no applicable print requests to remove.
Users can only remove print requests associated with their user name. See Notes. If a superuser executes lprm and
specifies the user operand, lprm removes all print requests belonging to the specified user.
The print client commands locate destination information using the "printers" database in the name service switch.
See nsswitch.conf(4), printers(4), and printers.conf(4) for details.
The following options are supported:
-P destination The name of the printer or class of printers (see lpadmin(1M)) from which to remove print requests.
Specify destination using atomic, URI-style (scheme://endpoint), or POSIX-style (server:destination) names. See
printers.conf(4) for information regarding the naming naming conventions for destination names.
<mi> If a user specifies this option, removes all print requests owned by that user. If a superuser specifies this option, re<hy>
moves all requests in the print queue. Job ownership is determined by the user's login name and host name on the
machine from which lpr was executed. See Notes.
The following operands are supported.
request-ID Removes a specific print request. Specify request-ID as the job number (Job) associated with a print re<hy>
quest and reported by lpq. See lpq(1B).
user Removes print requests associated with a specific user. Specify user as a valid user name. This option can only
be used by a superuser.
Example 1 Removing a Print Request
The following example removes request-ID 385 from destination killtree:
 example% lprm <mi>P killtree 385

Users can only remove print requests associated with their user name. By default, users can only remove print re<hy>
quests on the host from which the print request was submitted. If a superuser has set user-equivalence=true in
/etc/printers.conf on the print server, users can remove print requests associated with their user name on any host.
Superusers can remove print requests on the host from which the print request was submitted. Superusers can also
remove print requests from the print server.
Some print servers send cancelation notification to job owners when their print jobs have been cancelled. This notifi<hy>
cation usually comes in the form of an email message. Cancelation notices cannot be disabled on a Solaris server.
When IPP is in use, the user is prompted for a passphrase if the remote print service is configured to require authen<hy>
tication.
