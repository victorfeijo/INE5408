dumpcs <-> show codeset table for the current locale
dumpcs [-0123vw]
dumpcs shows a list of printable characters for the user's current locale, along with their hexadecimal code values.
The display device is assumed to be capable of displaying characters for a given locale. With no option, dumpcs dis<hy>
plays the entire list of printable characters for the current locale.
With one or more numeric options specified, it shows EUC codeset(s) for the current locale according to the num<hy>
bers specified, and in order of codeset number. Each non-printable character is represented by an asterisk "*" and
enough ASCII space character(s) to fill that codeset's column width.
-0 Show ASCII (or EUC primary) codeset.
-1 Show EUC codeset 1, if used for the current locale.
-2 Show EUC codeset 2, if used for the current locale.
-3 Show EUC codeset 3, if used for the current locale.
-v "Verbose". Normally, ranges of non-printable characters are collapsed into a single line. This option produces one
line for each non-printable character.
-w Replace code values with corresponding wide character values (process codes).
The environment variables LC_CTYPE and LANG control the character classification throughout dumpcs. On en<hy>
try to dumpcs, these environment variables are checked in that order. This implies that a new setting for LANG
does not override the setting of LC_CTYPE. When none of the values is valid, the character classification defaults
to the POSIX.1 "C" locale.
