install is most commonly used in ``makefiles'' (see make(1S)) to install a file in specific locations, or to create di<hy>
rectories within a file system. Each file is installed by copying it into the appropriate directory.
install uses no special privileges to copy files from one place to another. The implications of this are: <bu> You must
have permission to read the files to be installed. <bu> You must have permission to copy into the destination directory. <bu>
You must have permission to change the modes on the final copy of the file if you want to use the -m option. <bu> You
must be super-user if you want to specify the ownership of the installed file with the -u or -g options. If you are not
the super-user, the installed file is owned by you, regardless of who owns the original.
Note that if the ROOT environment variable is set, each of the default directory paths are prefixed by its value (for
example, $ROOT/bin and so on).
install prints messages telling the user exactly what files it is replacing or creating and where they are going.
If no options or directories (dirx ...) are given, install searches a set of default directories ( /bin, /usr/bin, /etc, /lib,
and /usr/lib, in that order) for a file with the same name as file. When the first occurrence is found, install issues a
message saying that it is overwriting that file with file, and proceeds to do so. If the file is not found, the program
states this and exits.
If one or more directories (dirx ...) are specified after file, those directories are searched before the default directo<hy>
ries.
This version of install (/usr/sbin/install) is not compatible with the install binaries in many versions of Unix other
than Solaris. For a higher degree of compatibility with other Unix versions, use /usr/ucb/install, which is described
in the install(1B) man page.
The following options are supported:
-c dira Install file in the directory specified by dira, if file does not yet exist. If it is found, install issues a message
saying that the file already exists, and exits without overwriting it.
-f dirb Force file to be installed in given directory, even if the file already exists. If the file being installed does not
already exist, the mode and owner of the new file is set to 755 and bin , respectively. If the file already exists, the
mode and owner is that of the already existing file.
-n dirc If file is not found in any of the searched directories, it is put in the directory specified in dirc. The mode and
owner of the new file is set to 755 and bin, respectively.
-d Create a directory. Missing parent directories are created as required as in mkdir -p. If the directory already ex<hy>
ists, the owner, group and mode is set to the values given on the command line.
-i Ignore default directory list, searching only through the given directories (dirx ...).

-m mode The mode of the new file is set to mode. Set to 0755 by default.
-u user The owner of the new file is set to user. Only available to the super-user. Set to bin by default.
-g group The group id of the new file is set to group. Only available to the super-user. Set to bin by default.
-o If file is found, save the ``found'' file by copying it to OLDfile in the directory in which it was found. This option
is useful when installing a frequently used file such as /bin/sh or /lib/saf/ttymon, where the existing file cannot be
removed.
-s Suppress printing of messages other than error messages.
