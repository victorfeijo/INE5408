int volmgt_running(void);
This function is obsolete. The management of removable media by the Volume Management feature, including vold,
has been replaced by software that supports the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). Programmatic support for HAL
is through the HAL APIs, which are documented on the HAL web site. See hal(5).
volmgt_running() tells whether or not Volume Management is running.
volmgt_running() always returns 0 indicating Volume Management (as implemented by vold) is not running.
volmgt_running() will fail, returning 0, if a stat(2) or open(2) of /dev/volctl fails, or if any of the following is true:
ENXIO Volume Management is not running.
EINTR An interrupt signal was detected while checking to see if Volume Management was running.
Example 1 Using volmgt_running()
To see if Volume Management is running:
 if (volmgt_running() != 0) {
  (void) printf("Volume Management is running\n");
 } else {
  (void) printf("Volume Management is NOT running\n");
 }

Volume Management must be running for many of the Volume Management library routines to work.
