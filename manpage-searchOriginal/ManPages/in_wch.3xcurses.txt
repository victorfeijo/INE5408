int in_wch(cchar_t *wcval);
int mvin_wch(int y, int x, cchar_t *wcval);
int mvwin_wch(WINDOW *win, inty, cchar_t *wcval);
int win_wch(WINDOW *win, cchar_t *wcval);
The in_wch() and win_wch() functions retrieve the complex character and its rendition located at the current cursor
position of the stdscr window and window win, respectively. The mvin_wch() and mvwin_wch() functions retrieve
the complex character and its rendition located at the position indicated by the x (column) and y (row) parameters
(the former in the stdscr window; the latter in window win).
All these functions store the retrieved character and its rendition in the object pointed to by wcval.
wcval Is a pointer to an object that can store a complex character and its rendition.
y Is the y (row) coordinate of the position of the character to be returned.
x Is the x (column) coordinate of the position of the character to be returned.
win Is a pointer to the window that contains the character to be returned.
On success, these functions return OK. Otherwise, they return ERR.
None.
