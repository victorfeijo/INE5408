int getcchar(const cchar_t *wcval, wchar_t *wch, attr_t *attrs,
 short *color_pair,void *opt);
If wch is not a null pointer, the getcchar() function splits the cchar_t object pointed to by wcval into a wide charac<hy>
ter string, attributes, and a color pair. It stores the attributes in the location pointed to by attrs, the color pair in the
location pointed to by color_pair, and the wide character string in the location pointed to by wch.
If wch is a null pointer, the getcchar() function simply returns the number of wide characters in the cchar_t object
pointed to by wcval. The objects pointed to by attrs and color_pair are not changed.
wcval Is a pointer to a cchar_t object.
wch Is a pointer to an object where a wide character string can be stored.
attrs Is a pointer to an object where attributes can be stored.
color_pair Is a pointer to an object where a color pair can be stored.
opts Is reserved for future use. Currently, this must be a null pointer.
When wch is a null pointer, the getcchar() function returns the number of wide characters in the string pointed to by
wcval including the null terminator.
When wch is not a null pointer, the getcchar() function returns OK on success and ERR otherwise.
