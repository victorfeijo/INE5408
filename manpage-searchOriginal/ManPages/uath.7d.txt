uath <-> Atheros AR5523 USB IEEE802.11a/b/g Wireless Network Driver
The uath IEEE802.11a/b/g wireless network driver is a multi-threaded, loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based
STREAMS driver supporting Atheros AR5523 USB IEEE802.11a/b/g wireless network driver.
The uath driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rate and mode. The driver supports only BSS net<hy>
works (also known as ap or infrastructure networks) and open (or open-system) or shared system authentication.
For wireless security, WEP encryption, WPA-PSk, and WPA2-PSK are currently supported. You can perform config<hy>
uration and administration tasks using the dladm(1M) and wificonfig(1M) utilities.
