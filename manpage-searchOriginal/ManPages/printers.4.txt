$HOME/.printers
The $HOME/.printers file is a simplified version of the system /etc/printers.conf file. See printers.conf(4). Users
create the $HOME/.printers file in their home directory. This optional file is customizable by the user.
The $HOME/.printers file performs the following functions: 1. Sets personal aliases for all print commands. 2.
Sets the interest list for the lpget, lpstat, and cancel commands. See lpget(1M), lpstat(1) and cancel(1). 3. Sets the
default printer for the lp, lpr, lpq, and lprm commands. See lp(1), lpr(1B), lpq(1B), and lprm(1B).
Use a line or full screen editor to create or modify the $HOME/.printers file.
Each entry in $HOME/.printers describes one destination. Entries are one line consisting of two fields separated by
either BLANKs or TABs and terminated by a NEWLINE. Format for an entry in $HOME/.printers varies accord<hy>
ing to the purpose of the entry.
Empty lines can be included for readability. Entries can continue on to multiple lines by adding a backslash (`\') as
the last character in the line. The $HOME/.printers file can include comments. Comments have a pound sign (`#')
as the first character in the line, and are terminated by a NEWLINE.
Specify the alias or aliases in the first field. Separate multiple aliases by a pipe sign (`|'). Specify the destination in
the second field. A destination names a printer or class of printers, See lpadmin(1M). Specify the destination using
atomic, URI-style (scheme://endpoint), or POSIX-style (server:destination) names. See printers.conf(4) for infor<hy>
mation regarding the naming conventions for destination names.
Specify _all in the first field. Specify the list of destinations for the interest list in the second field. Separate each
destinations by a comma (`,'). Specify destinations using atomic, URI-style (scheme://endpoint), or POSIX-style
(server:destination) names. See printers.conf(4) for information regarding the naming conventions for destination
names. This list of destinations can refer to an alias defined in $HOME/.printers.
Specify _default in the first field. Specify the default destination in the second field. Specify the default destination
using atomic, URI-style (scheme://endpoint), or POSIX-style (server:destination) names. See printers.conf(4) for
information regarding the naming conventions for destination names. The default destination can refer to an alias de<hy>
fined in $HOME/.printers.
The print client commands locate destination information based on the "printers" database entry in the /etc/nss<hy>
witch.conf file. See nsswitch.conf(4).
The default destination is located differently depending on the command.
The lp command locates the default destination in the following order: 1. lp command's -d destination option. 2.
LPDEST environment variable. 3. PRINTER environment variable. 4. _default destination in $HOME/.print<hy>
ers. 5. _default destination in /etc/printers.conf.
The lpr, lpq, and lprm commands locate the default destination in the following order: 1. lpr command's -P desti<hy>
nation option. 2. PRINTER environment variable. 3. LPDEST environment variable. 4. _default destination in
$HOME/.printers. 5. _default destination in /etc/printers.conf.
The lpget, lpstat, and cancel commands locate the interest list in the following order: 1. _all list in $HOME/.print<hy>
ers. 2. _all list in /etc/printers.conf. Example 1 Setting the Interest List
The following entry sets the interest list to destinations ps, secure, and dog at server west and finance_ps:
 _all  ps,secure,west:dog,lpd://server/printers/queue
Example 2 Setting Aliases to a Printer
The following entry sets the aliases ps, lp, and lw to sparc_printer:
 ps|lp|lw sparc_printer

Example 3 Setting an Alias as a Default Destination
The following entry sets the alias pcl to hplj and sets it as the default destination:
 pcl|_default hplj
Example 4 Setting an Alias to a Server Destination
The following entry sets the alias secure to destination catalpa at server tabloid:
 secure tabloid:catalpa
Example 5 Setting an Alias to a Site Destination
The following entry sets the alias insecure to destination legal_ps using IPP:
 insecureipp://server/printers/legal_ps

System Administration Guide: Basic Administration
$HOME/.printers is referenced by the printing commands before further name resolution is made in /etc/print<hy>
ers.conf or the name service. If the alias references a destination defined in /etc/printers.conf, it is possible that the
destination is defined differently on different systems. This could cause output to be sent to an unintended destina<hy>
tion if the user is logged in to a different system.
