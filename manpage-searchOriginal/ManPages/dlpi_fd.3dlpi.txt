int dlpi_fd(dlpi_handle_t dh);
The dlpi_fd() function returns the integer file descriptor that can be used to directly operate on the open DLPI
stream associated with the DLPI handle dh. This file descriptor can be used to perform non-DLPI operations that do
not alter the state of the DLPI stream, such as waiting for an event using poll(2), or pushing and configuring addi<hy>
tional STREAMS modules, such as pfmod(7M). If DLPI operations are directly performed on the file descriptor, or
a STREAMS module is pushed that alters the message-passing interface such that DLPI operations can no longer
be issued, future operations on dh might not behave as documented.
The returned file descriptor is managed by libdlpi(3LIB) and the descriptor must not be closed.
The function returns the integer file descriptor associated with the DLPI handle dh. If dh is invalid, -1 is returned.
