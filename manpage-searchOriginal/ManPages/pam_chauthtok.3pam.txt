int pam_chauthtok(pam_handle_t *pamh, const int flags);
The pam_chauthtok() function is called to change the authentication token associated with a particular user refer<hy>
enced by the authentication handle pamh.
The following flag may be passed in to pam_chauthtok():
PAM_SILENT The password service should not generate any messages.
PAM_CHANGE_EXPIRED_AUTHTOK The password service should only update those passwords that have
aged. If this flag is not passed, all password services should update their passwords.
PAM_NO_AUTHTOK_CHECK The password service should not perform conformance checks on the password
entered.
Upon successful completion of the call, the authentication token of the user will be changed in accordance with the
password service configured in the system through pam.conf(4).
Upon successful completion, PAM_SUCCESS is returned. In addition to the error return values described in
pam(3PAM), the following values may be returned:
PAM_PERM_DENIED No permission.
PAM_AUTHTOK_ERR Authentication token manipulation error.
PAM_AUTHTOK_RECOVERY_ERR Authentication information cannot be recovered.
PAM_AUTHTOK_LOCK_BUSY Authentication token lock busy.
PAM_AUTHTOK_DISABLE_AGING Authentication token aging disabled.
PAM_USER_UNKNOWN User unknown to password service.
PAM_TRY_AGAIN Preliminary check by password service failed.

The flag PAM_CHANGE_EXPIRED_AUTHTOK is typically used by a login application which has determined
that the user's password has aged or expired. Before allowing the user to login, the login application may invoke
pam_chauthtok() with this flag to allow the user to update the password. Typically, applications such as passwd(1)
should not use this flag.
The pam_chauthtok() functions performs a preliminary check before attempting to update passwords. This check is
<beginning of page>
performed for each password module in the stack as listed in pam.conf(4). The check may include pinging remote
name services to determine if they are available. If pam_chauthtok() returns PAM_TRY_AGAIN, then the check
has failed, and passwords are not updated.
The flag PAM_NO_AUTHTOK_CHECK is typically used by programs that allow an administrator to bypass vari<hy>
ous password conformance checks when setting a password for a user.
The interfaces in libpam are MT-Safe only if each thread within the multithreaded application uses its own PAM
handle.
