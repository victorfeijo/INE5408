The picl_get_next_by_row() function copies the handle of the property that is in the next column of the table and
on the same row as the property proph. The handle is copied into the location given by rowh.

If there are no more rows or columns, this function returns the value PICL_ENDOFLIST.
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. On failure, a non-negative integer is returned to indicate an error.
PICL_STALEHANDLE is returned if the handle is no longer valid. This occurs if the PICL tree was refreshed or
reinitialized.

saved handles.
