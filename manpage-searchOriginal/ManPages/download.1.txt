download <-> host resident PostScript font downloader
download [-f] [-p printer] [-m name] [-H directory]
 [file]...
/usr/lib/lp/postscript/download
download prepends host resident fonts to files and writes the results on the standard output. If no files are specified,
or if <mi> is one of the input files, the standard input is read. download assumes the input files make up a single Post<hy>
Script job and that requested fonts can be included at the start of each input file.
Requested fonts are named in a comment (marked with %%DocumentFonts:) in the input files. Available fonts are
the ones listed in the map table selected using the -m option.
The map table consists of fontname<mi>file pairs. The fontname is the full name of the PostScript font, exactly as it
would appear in a %%DocumentFonts: comment. The file is the pathname of the host resident font. A file that be<hy>
gins with a / is used as is. Otherwise the pathname is relative to the host font directory. Comments are introduced by
% (as in PostScript) and extend to the end of the line.
The only candidates for downloading are fonts listed in the map table that point download to readable files. A font
is downloaded once, at most. Requests for unlisted fonts or inaccessible files are ignored. All requests are ignored if
the map table can not be read.
-f Force a complete scan of each input file. In the absence of an explicit comment pointing download to the end of
the file, the default scan stops immediately after the PostScript header comments.
-p printer Check the list of printer-resident fonts in /etc/lp/printers/printer/residentfonts before downloading.
-m name Use name as the font map table. A name that begins with / is the full pathname of the map table and is used
as is. Otherwise name is appended to the pathname of the host font directory.
-H directory Use dir as the host font directory. The default is /usr/lib/lp/postscript.
Example 1 Examples of the download command.
The following map table could be used to control the downloading of the Bookman font family:
 %
 % The first string is the full PostScript font name. The second string
 % is the file name - relative to the host font directory unless it begins
 % with a /.
 %
  Bookman-Light bookman/light
  Bookman-LightItalic bookman/lightitalic
  Bookman-Demi bookman/demi
  Bookman-DemiItalic bookman/demiitalic
Using the file myprinter/map (in the default host font directory) as the map table, you could download fonts by is<hy>
suing the following command:
 example% download -m myprinter/map file
The following exit values are returned:

The download program should be part of a more general program.
download does not look for %%PageFonts: comments and there is no way to force multiple downloads of a partic<hy>
ular font.
Using full pathnames in either map tables or the names of map tables is not recommended.
