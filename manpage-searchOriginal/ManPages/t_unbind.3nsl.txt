t_unbind <-> disable a transport endpoint

int t_unbind(int fd);
The This routine is part of the XTI interfaces which evolved from the TLI interfaces. XTI represents the future
evolution of these interfaces. However, TLI interfaces are supported for compatibility. When using a TLI routine
that has the same name as an XTI routine, the tiuser.h header file must be used. Refer to the TLI COMPATIBIL<hy>
ITY section for a description of differences between the two interfaces.
t_unbind() function disables the transport endpoint specified by fd which was previously bound by t_bind(3NSL).
On completion of this call, no further data or events destined for this transport endpoint will be accepted by the
transport provider. An endpoint which is disabled by using t_unbind() can be enabled by a subsequent call to
t_bind(3NSL).
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned. Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and t_errno is set to in<hy>
dicate an error.
T_IDLE.
On failure, t_errno is set to one of the following:
TBADF The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.
TLOOK An asynchronous event has occurred on this transport endpoint.
TOUTSTATE The communications endpoint referenced by fd is not in one of the states in which a call to this func<hy>
tion is valid.
TPROTO This error indicates that a communication problem has been detected between XTI and the transport
provider for which there is no other suitable XTI error (t_errno).
TSYSERR A system error has occurred during execution of this function.
The XTI and TLI interface definitions have common names but use different header files. This, and other semantic
differences between the two interfaces are described in the subsections below.
The XTI interfaces use the header file, xti.h . TLI interfaces should not use this header. They should use the header:
 #include <tiuser.h>
The t_errno value that can be set by the XTI interface and cannot be set by the TLI interface is:
 TPROTO
