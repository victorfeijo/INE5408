stmfCreateLu <-> create a logical unit
cc [ flag... ] file... -lstmf [ library... ]
#include <libstmf.h>
int stmfCreateLu(luResource hdl, stmfGuid *luGuid);
hdl The logical unit resource returned from a previous call to stmfCreateLuResource(3STMF).
luGuid If non-null, it must contain a pointer to an stmfGuid structure allocated by the caller. On successful return
from this API, it will contain the guid of the newly created logical unit. If luGuid is NULL, this argument is ignored.
The stmfCreateLu function creates a logical unit in stmf using the properties of hdl. See stmfSetLuProp(3STMF)
for a complete description of properties and their possible values.
The following values are returned:
STMF_STATUS_SUCCESS
