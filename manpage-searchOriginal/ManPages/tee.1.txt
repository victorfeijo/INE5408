tee <-> replicate the standard output
/usr/bin/tee [-ai] [file]...
tee [-ail] [file]...
/usr/bin/tee copies standard input to standard output, making a copy in zero or more files. tee does not buffer its out<hy>
put. The options determine if the specified files are overwritten or appended to.
The tee built-in in ksh93 is associated with the /bin and /usr/bin paths. It is invoked when tee is executed without a
pathname prefix and the pathname search finds a /bin/tee or /usr/bin/tee executable.
tee copies standard input to standard output and to zero or more files. The options determine whether the specified
files are overwritten or appended to. The tee utility does not buffer output. If a write to a file fails, tee continues to
write to other files although it exits with a non-zero exit status.
The number of file operands that can be specified is limited by the underlying operating system.
The following options are supported by /usr/bin/tee:
-a Appends the output to the files rather than overwriting them.
-i Ignores interrupts.
The following options are supported by the tee built-in command in ksh93:
-a
--append Appends the output to the files rather than overwriting them.
-i
--ignore-interrupts Ignores SIGINT signal.
-l
--line-buffer Sets the standard output to be line buffered.
The following operands are supported:
file A path name of an output file. Processing of at least 13 file operands are supported.
See largefile(5) for the description of the behavior of tee when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte (
2^31 bytes).
See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of tee: LANG,
LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.
The following exit values are returned by /usr/bin/tee:
0 The standard input was successfully copied to all output files.
>0 The number of files that could not be opened or whose status could not be obtained.
The following exit values are returned by tee in ksh93:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred.
