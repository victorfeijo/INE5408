ICMP is the error and control message protocol used by the Internet protocol family. It is used by the kernel to han<hy>
dle and report errors in protocol processing. It may also be accessed by programs using the socket interface or the
Transport Level Interface (TLI) for network monitoring and diagnostic functions. When used with the socket inter<hy>
face, a "raw socket" type is used. The protocol number for ICMP, used in the proto parameter to the socket call, can
be obtained from getprotobyname(3SOCKET). ICMP file descriptors and sockets are connectionless, and are nor<hy>
mally used with the t_sndudata / t_rcvudata and the sendto() / recvfrom() calls.
Outgoing packets automatically have an Internet Protocol (IP) header prepended to them. Incoming packets are pro<hy>
vided to the user with the IP header and options intact.
ICMP is an datagram protocol layered above IP. It is used internally by the protcol code for various purposes in<hy>
cluding routing, fault isolation, and congestion control. Receipt of an ICMP "redirect" message will add a new entry
in the routing table, or modify an existing one. ICMP messages are routinely sent by the protocol code. Received
ICMP messages may be reflected back to users of higher-level protocols such as TCP or UDP as error returns from
system calls. A copy of all ICMP message received by the system is provided to every holder of an open ICMP
socket or TLI descriptor.

A socket operation may fail with one of the following errors returned:
EISCONN An attempt was made to establish a connection on a socket which already has one, or when trying to
send a datagram with the destination address specified and the socket is already connected.
ENOTCONN An attempt was made to send a datagram, but no destination address is specified, and the socket has
not been connected.
ENOBUFS The system ran out of memory for an internal data structure.
EADDRNOTAVAIL An attempt was made to create a socket with a network address for which no network interface
exists.
Replies to ICMP "echo" messages which are source routed are not sent back using inverted source routes, but rather
go back through the normal routing mechanisms.
