uucp, uulog, uuname <-> UNIX-to-UNIX system copy
uucp [-c | -C] [-d | -f] [-ggrade] [-jmr] [-nuser] [-sfile]
 [-xdebug_level] source-file destination-file
uulog [-ssys] [-fsystem] [-x] [-number] system
uuname [-c | -l]
The uucp utility copies files named by the source-file arguments to the destination-file argument.
The uulog utility queries a log file of uucp or uuxqt transactions in file /var/uucp/.Log/uucico/system or
/var/uucp/.Log/uuxqt/system.
The uuname utility lists the names of systems known to uucp.
The following options are supported by uucp:
-c Does not copy local file to the spool directory for transfer to the remote machine (default).
-C Forces the copy of local files to the spool directory for transfer.
-d Makes all necessary directories for the file copy (default).
-f Does not make intermediate directories for the file copy.
-g grade grade can be either a single letter, number, or a string of alphanumeric characters defining a service grade.
The uuglist command can determine whether it is appropriate to use the single letter, number, or a string of alphanu<hy>
meric characters as a service grade. The output from the uuglist command is a list of service grades that are avail<hy>
able, or a message that says to use a single letter or number as a grade of service.
-j Prints the uucp job identification string on standard output. This job identification can be used by uustat to obtain
the status of a uucp job or to terminate a uucp job. The uucp job is valid as long as the job remains queued on the
local system.
-m Sends mail to the requester when the copy is complete.
-n user Notifies user on the remote system that a file was sent.
When multiple -n options are passed in, uucp only retains the value specified for the last -n option. This is the only
user notified.
-r Does not start the file transfer, just queue the job.
-s file Reports status of the transfer to file. This option is accepted for compatibility, but it is ignored because it is in<hy>
secure.
-x debug_level Produce debugging output on standard output. debug_level is a number between 0 and 9. As de<hy>
bug_level increases to 9, more detailed debugging information is given. This option may not be available on all sys<hy>
tems.
The following options cause uulog to print logging information:
-s sys Prints information about file transfer work involving system sys.
<beginning of page>
-f system Executes a tail -f command of the file transfer log for system. You must press BREAK to exit this function.
Other options used in conjunction with the above options are:
-x Looks in the uuxqt log file for the given system.
-number Executes a tail command of number lines.
The following options are supported by uuname:
-c Displays the names of systems known to cu. The two lists are the same, unless your machine is using different
Systems files for cu and uucp. See the Sysfiles file.
-l Displays the local system name.
The source file name may be a path name on your machine, or may have the form:
 system-name!pathname
where system-name is taken from a list of system names that uucp knows about. source_file is restricted to no more
than one system-name. The destination system-name may also include a list of system names such as
 system-name!system-name!...!system-name!pathname
In this case, an attempt is made to send the file, using the specified route, to the destination. Care should be taken to
ensure that intermediate nodes in the route are willing to forward information. See NOTES for restrictions.
For C-Shell users, the exclamation point (!) character must be surrounded by single quotes ('), or preceded by a
backslash (\).
The shell metacharacters ?, * and [...] appearing in pathname are expanded on the appropriate system.
Pathnames may be one of the following: 1. An absolute pathname. 2. A pathname preceded by ~user where user is
a login name on the specified system and is replaced by that user's login directory. 3. A pathname preceded by
~/destination where destination is appended to /var/spool/uucppublic. This destination is treated as a filename un<hy>
less more than one file is being transferred by this request or the destination is already a directory. To ensure that the
destination is a directory, follow it with a forward slash (/). For example, ~/dan/ as the destination creates the direc<hy>
tory /var/spool/uucppublic/dan if it does not exist and put the requested file(s) in that directory.
Anything else is prefixed by the current directory.
If the result is an erroneous path name for the remote system, the copy fails. If the destination-file is a directory, the
last part of the source-file name is used.
Invoking uucp with shell wildcard characters as the remote source-file invokes the uux(1C) command to execute the
uucp command on the remote machine. The remote uucp command spools the files on the remote machine. After
the first session terminates, if the remote machine is configured to transfer the spooled files to the local machine, the
remote machine initiates a call and send the files; otherwise, the user must "call" the remote machine to transfer the
files from the spool directory to the local machine. This call can be done manually using Uutry(1M), or as a side ef<hy>
fect of another uux(1C) or uucp call.
Notice that the local machine must have permission to execute the uucp command on the remote machine in order
for the remote machine to send the spooled files.
uucp removes execute permissions across the transmission and gives 0666 read and write permissions (see
chmod(2)).

See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of uucp: LANG,
LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, LC_TIME, NLSPATH, and TZ.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred.

For security reasons, the domain of remotely accessible files may be severely restricted. You probably are not able to
access files by path name. Ask a responsible person on the remote system to send them to you. For the same reasons
you are probably not able to send files to arbitrary path names. As distributed, the remotely accessible files are those
whose names begin /var/spool/uucppublic (equivalent to ~/).
All files received by uucp are owned by uucp.
The -m option only works when sending files or receiving a single file. Receiving multiple files specified by special
shell characters ?, &, and [...] does not activate the -m option.
The forwarding of files through other systems may not be compatible with the previous version of uucp. If forward<hy>
ing is used, all systems in the route must have compatible versions of uucp.
Protected files and files that are in protected directories that are owned by the requester can be sent by uucp. Howev<hy>
er, if the requester is root, and the directory is not searchable by "other" or the file is not readable by "other", the re<hy>
quest fails.
Strings that are passed to remote systems may not be evaluated in the same locale as the one in use by the process
that invoked uucp on the local system.
Configuration files must be treated as C (or POSIX) locale text files.
