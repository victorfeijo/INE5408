hba_dip The dev_info_t pointer associated with the SCSI HBA.
The tran_quiesce() and tran_unquiesce() vectors in the scsi_hba_tran(9S) structure should be initialized during
the HBA driver's attach(9E). They are HBA entry points to be called when a user initiates quiesce and unquiesce
operations through device control interfaces.
tran_quiesce() should wait for all outstanding commands to complete and blocks (or queues) any I/O requests is<hy>
sued. tran_unquiesce() should allow I/O activities to resume on the SCSI bus.
Implementation is hardware specific.
tran_quiesce() and tran_unquiesce() should return:
0 Successful completion.
Non-zero An error occurred.
