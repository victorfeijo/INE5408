int semget(key_t key, int nsems, int semflg);
The semget() function returns the semaphore identifier associated with key.
A semaphore identifier and associated data structure and set containing nsems semaphores (see Intro(2)) are created
for key if one of the following is true: <bu> key is equal to IPC_PRIVATE. <bu> key does not already have a semaphore
identifier associated with it, and (semflg&IPC_CREAT) is true.
On creation, the data structure associated with the new semaphore identifier is initialized as follows: <bu>
sem_perm.cuid, sem_perm.uid, sem_perm.cgid, and sem_perm.gid are set equal to the effective user ID and ef<hy>
fective group ID, respectively, of the calling process. <bu> The access permission bits of sem_perm.mode are set equal
to the access permission bits of semflg. <bu> sem_nsems is set equal to the value of nsems. <bu> sem_otime is set equal to
0 and sem_ctime is set equal to the current time.
Upon successful completion, a non-negative integer representing a semaphore identifier is returned. Otherwise, <mi>1 is
returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
The semget() function will fail if:
EACCES A semaphore identifier exists for key, but operation permission (see Intro(2)) as specified by the low-or<hy>
der 9 bits of semflg would not be granted.
EEXIST A semaphore identifier exists for key but both (semflg&IPC_CREAT) and (semflg&IPC_EXCL) are both
true.
EINVAL The nsems argument is either less than or equal to 0 or greater than the system-imposed limit. See NOTES.
A semaphore identifier exists for key, but the number of semaphores in the set associated with it is less than nsems
and nsems is not equal to 0.
ENOENT A semaphore identifier does not exist for key and (semflg&IPC_CREAT) is false.
ENOSPC A semaphore identifier is to be created but the system-imposed limit on the maximum number of allowed
semaphores or semaphore identifiers system-wide would be exceeded. See NOTES.

The system-imposed limit on the value of the nsems argument is the maintained on a per-process basis using the
process.max-sem-nsems resource control.
The system-imposed limit on the number of semaphore identifiers is maintained on a per-project basis using the
project.max-sem-ids resource control. The zone.max-sem-ids resource control limis the total number of sema<hy>
phore identifiers that can be allocated by a zone.
See rctladm(1M) and setrctl(2) for information about using resource controls.
