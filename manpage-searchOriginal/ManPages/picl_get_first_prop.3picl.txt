int picl_get_first_prop(picl_nodehdl_t nodeh,
 piclprop_hdl_t *proph);
int picl_get_next_prop(picl_prophdl_t proph,
 picl_prophdl_t *nextprop);
The picl_get_first_prop() function gets the handle of the first property of the node specified by nodeh and copies it
into the location given by proph.
The picl_get_next_prop() function gets the handle of the next property after the one specified by proph from the
property list of the node, and copies it into the location specified by nextprop.
If there are no more properties, this function returns PICL_ENDOFLIST.
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. On failure, a non-negative integer is returned to indicate an error.
PICL_ENDOFLIST is returned to indicate that there are no more properties.
PICL_STALEHANDLE is returned if the handle is no longer valid. This occurs if the PICL tree was refreshed or
reinitialized.
PICL_INVALIDHANDLE is returned if the specified handle never existed. This error may be returned for a previ<hy>
ously valid handle if the daemon was brought down and restarted. When this occurs a client must revalidate any
saved handles.
PICL_NOTINITIALIZED Session not initialized
PICL_NORESPONSE Daemon not responding
PICL_NOTNODE Not a node
PICL_NOTPROP Not a property
PICL_INVALIDHANDLE Invalid handle
PICL_STALEHANDLE Stale handle
PICL_FAILURE General system failure
PICL_ENDOFLIST End of list
