/etc/security/device_maps
The device_maps file contains access control information about each physical device. Each device is represented by
a one line entry of the form:
 device-name : device-type : device-list :
where
device-name
This is an arbitrary ASCII string naming the physical device. This field contains no embedded white space or non-
printable characters.
device-type
This is an arbitrary ASCII string naming the generic device type. This field identifies and groups together devices of
like type. This field contains no embedded white space or non-printable characters.
device-list
This is a list of the device special files associated with the physical device. This field contains valid device special
file path names separated by white space.
The device_maps file is an ASCII file that resides in the /etc/security directory.
Lines in device_maps can end with a `\' to continue an entry on the next line.
Comments may also be included. A `#' makes a comment of all further text until the next NEWLINE not immedi<hy>
ately preceded by a `\'.
Leading and trailing blanks are allowed in any of the fields.
The device_maps file must be created by the system administrator bef\ore device allocation is enabled.
This file is owned by root, with a group of sys, and a mode of 0644. Example 1 A Sample device_maps File
