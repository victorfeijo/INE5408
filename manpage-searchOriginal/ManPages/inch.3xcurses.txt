chtype inch(void);
chtype mvinch(int y, int x);
chtype mvwinch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);
chtype winch(WINDOW *win);
The inch() and winch() functions return the chtype character located at the current cursor position of the stdscr
window and window win, respectively. The mvinch() and mvwinch() functions return the chtype character located
at the position indicated by the x (column) and y (row) parameters (the former in the stdscr window; the latter in
window win).
The complete character/attribute pair will be returned. The character or attributes can be extracted by performing a
bitwise AND on the returned value, using the constants A_CHARTEXT, A_ATTRIBUTES, and A_COLOR.
y Is the y (row) coordinate of the position of the character to be returned.
x Is the x (column) coordinate of the position of the character to be returned.
win Is a pointer to the window that contains the character to be returned.
On success, these functions return the specified character and rendition. Otherwise, they return ERR.
None.
