dat.conf <-> DAT static registry
/etc/dat/dat.conf
The DAT static registry, /etc/dat/dat.conf is a system-wide data resource maintained by the system administrative
command datadm(1M).
/etc/dat/dat.conf contains a list of interface adapters supported by uDAPL service providers. An interface adapter
on Infiniband (IB) corresponds to an IPoIB device instance, for example, ibd0. An IPoIB device name represents an
IP interface plumbed by ifconfig(1M) on an IB partition/Host Channel Adapter port combination.
Each entry in the DAT static registry is a single line that contains eight fields. Fields are separated by a SPACE.
Lines that begin with a pound sign (#) are considered comments. All characters that follow the # are ignored. En<hy>
close Solaris specific strings (Solaris_specific_string) and service provider's instance data (service _provider_in<hy>
stance_data) in quotes.
The following shows the order of the fields in a dat.conf entry:
 "interface_adapter_name" "API_version" "threadsafe | nonthreadsafe" \
 "default | nondefault" "service_provider_library_pathname" \
 "service_provider_version" "service _provider_instance_data"\
 "Solaris_specific_string"
The fields are defined as follows:
interface_adapter_name
Specifies the Interface Adapter (IA) name. In IB, this is the IPoIB device instance name, for example, ibd0. This
represents an IP interface plumbed on an IB partition/port combination of the HCA.
API_version
Specifies the API version of the service provide library: For example, "u"major.minor is u1.2.
threadsafe | nonthreadsafe
Specifies a threadsafe or non-threadsafe library.
default | nondefault
Specifies a default or non-default version of library. A service provider can offer several versions of the library. If so,
one version is designated as default with the rest as nondefault.
service_provider_library_pathname
Specifies the pathname of the library image.
service_provider_version
Specifies the version of the service provider. By convention, specify the company stock symbol as the service
provider, followed by major and minor version numbers, for example, SUNW1.0.
service _provider_instance_data
Specifies the service provider instance data.
Solaris_specific_string
Specifies a platform specific string, for example, the device name in the service_provider.conf file.
Example 1 Sample dat.conf File
<beginning of page>
The following dat.conf file shows a uDAPL 1.2 service provider for tavor, udapl_tavor.so.1 supporting two inter<hy>
faces, ibd0 and ibd1:
 #
 # dat.conf for uDAPL 1.2
 #
 ibd0 u1.2 nonthreadsafe default udapl_tavor.so.1 SUNW.1.0 ""
 "driver_name=tavor"
 ibd1 u1.2 nonthreadsafe default udapl_tavor.so.1 SUNW.1.0 ""
 "driver_name=tavor"

An empty dat.conf is created during the package SUNWudaplr installation if no file is present beforehand. Entries
in the file are added or removed by running datadm(1M).
The content of the platform specific string does not constitute an API. It is generated by datadm(1M) and might
have a different content or interpretation in a future release.
