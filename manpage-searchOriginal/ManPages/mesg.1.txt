mesg <-> permit or deny messages
mesg [-n | -y | n | y]
The mesg utility will control whether other users are allowed to send messages via write(1), talk(1), or other utili<hy>
ties to a terminal device. The terminal device affected is determined by searching for the first terminal in the se<hy>
quence of devices associated with standard input, standard output, and standard error, respectively. With no argu<hy>
ments, mesg reports the current state without changing it. Processes with appropriate privileges may be able to send
messages to the terminal independent of the current state.
The following options are supported:
-n|n Denies permission to other users to send message to the terminal. See write(1).
-y|y Grants permission to other users to send messages to the terminal.
See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of mesg: LANG,
LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.
The following exit values are returned:
0 if messages are receivable.
1 if messages are not receivable.
2 on error.
