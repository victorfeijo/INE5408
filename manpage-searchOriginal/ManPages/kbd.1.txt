The kbd utility manipulates the state of the keyboard, or displays the keyboard type, or allows the default keyboard
abort sequence effect to be changed. The abort sequence also applies to serial console devices. The kbd utility sets
the /dev/kbd default keyboard device.
The -i option reads and processes default values for the keyclick and keyboard abort settings from the /etc/de<hy>
fault/kbd keyboard default file. Only keyboards that support a clicker respond to the -c option. To turn clicking on
by default, add or change the value of the KEYCLICK variable in the /etc/default/kbd file to:
 KEYCLICK=on
Next, run the command kbd -i to change the setting. Valid settings for the KEYCLICK variable are on and off; all
other values are ignored. If the KEYCLICK variable is not specified in the default file, the setting is unchanged.
The keyboard abort sequence effect can only be changed by a super-user using the -a option. This sequence is typi<hy>
cally Stop-A or L1-A and Shift-Pause on the keyboard on SPARC systems, F1-A and Shift-Pause on x86 systems,
and BREAK on the serial console input device on most systems.
A BREAK condition that originates from an erroneous electrical signal cannot be distinguished from one deliberate<hy>
ly sent by remote DCE. As a remedy, use the -a option with Alternate Break to switch break interpretation. Due to
the risk of incorrect sequence interpretation, binary protocols such as SLIP and others should not be run over the se<hy>
rial console port when Alternate Break sequence is in effect.
Although PPP is a binary protocol, it has the ability to avoid using characters that interfere with serial operation. The
default alternate break sequence is CTRL-m ~ CTRL-b, or 0D 7E 02 in hexidecimal. In PPP, this can be avoided by
setting either 0x00000004 or 0x00002000 in the ACCM. This forces an escape for the CTRL-b or CTRL-m charac<hy>
ters, respectively.
To do this in Solaris PPP 4.0, add:
 asyncmap 0x00002000
to the /etc/ppp/options file or any of the other configuration files used for the connection. See pppd(1M).
SLIP has no comparable capability, and must not be used if the Alternate Break sequence is in use.
The Alternate Break sequence has no effect on the keyboard abort. For more information on the Alternate Break se<hy>
quence, see zs(7D),se(7D), and asy(7D).
On many systems, the default effect of the keyboard abort sequence is to suspend the operating system and enter the
debugger or the monitor. Some systems feature key switches with a secure position. On these systems, setting the
key switch to the secure position overrides any software default set with this command.
To permanently change the software default effect of the keyboard abort sequence, first add or change the value of
the KEYBOARD_ABORT variable in the /etc/default/kbd file to:
 KEYBOARD_ABORT=disable
<beginning of page>
Next, run the command kbd -i to change the setting. Valid settings are enable, disable, and alternate; all other val<hy>
ues are ignored. If the variable is not specified in the default file, the setting is unchanged.
To set the abort sequence to the hardware BREAK, set the value of the KEYBOARD_ABORT variable in the
/etc/default/kbd file to:
 KEYBOARD_ABORT=enable
To change the current setting, run the command kbd -i. To set the abort sequence to the Alternate Break character
sequence, first set the current value of the KEYBOARD_ABORT variable in the /etc/default/kbd file to:
 KEYBOARD_ABORT=alternate
Next, run the command kbd -i to change the setting. When the Alternate Break sequence is in effect, only serial con<hy>
sole devices are affected.
To set the autorepeat delay by default, set the REPEAT_DELAY variable in the file /etc/default/kbd to the expect<hy>
ed value with units in milliseconds (ms). To avoid making the keyboard unusable due to a typographical error, delay
values below KIOCRPTDELAY_MIN (defined in /usr/include/sys/kbio.h) are rejected with EINVAL:
 REPEAT_DELAY=500
To set the autorepeat rate by default, set the REPEAT_RATE variable in the file /etc/default/kbd to the expected
value with units in milliseconds. Negative and zero repeat rates are ejected with EINVAL:
 REPEAT_RATE=33
To change the current settings of delay and rate, run the command, kbd -i. When the Auto Repeat Delay and/or Au<hy>
to Repeat Rate are in effect, only command line mode is affected.
To set the language by default, set the LAYOUT variable in the file /etc/default/kbd to the expected language.
These languages supported in kernel can be found by running kbd -s. Other values are ignored. For example, the fol<hy>
lowing sets Spanish layout to the keyboard:
 LAYOUT=Spanish
Next, run the kbd -i to change the setting. When Solaris reboots, the Spanish key table is loaded into kernel. These
layouts are valid for usb and ps/2 keyboards.
To set the keyboard beeper frequency by default, set the KBD_BEEPER_FREQ variable in the file /etc/de<hy>
fault/kbd to the expected value with units in HZ. This value should be between 0 and 32767, inclusive. Otherwise
will be rejected with EINVAL:
 KBD_BEEPER_FREQ=2000
To set the console beeper frequency by default, set the CONSOLE_BEEPER_FREQ variable in the file /etc/de<hy>
fault/kbd to the expected value with units in HZ. This value should be between 0 and 32767, inclusive. Otherwise
will be rejected with EINVAL:
 CONSOLE_BEEPER_FREQ=900
To change the current settings of keyboard beeper frequency and console beeper frequency, run kbd -i.
<beginning of page>
The following options are supported:
-a enable | disable | alternate
Enables, disables, or alternates the keyboard abort sequence effect. By default, a keyboard abort sequence suspends
the operating system on most systems. This sequence is typically Stop-A or L1-A and Shift-Pause on the keyboard
on SPARC systems, F1-A and Shift-Pause on x86 systems, and BREAK on the serial console device.
The default keyboard behavior can be changed using this option. The -a option can only be used by a super-user.
enable Enables the default effect of the keyboard abort sequence (suspend the operating system and enter the debug<hy>
ger or the monitor).
disable Disables the default/alternate effect and ignores keyboard abort sequences.
alternate Enables the alternate effect of the keyboard abort sequences (suspend the operating system and enter the
debugger or the monitor) upon receiving the Alternate Break character sequence on the console. The Alternate
Break sequence is defined by the drivers zs(7D), se(7D), asy(7D). Due to a risk of incorrect sequence interpretation,
binary protocols cannot be run over the serial console port when this value is used.
-b keyboard | console
Sets the beeper frequency for keyboard or console.
keyboard Set the keyboard beeper frequency to the operand in HZ. See OPERANDS.
console Sets the console beeper frequency to the operand in HZ. See OPERANDS.
-c on | off
Turns the clicking of the keyboard on or off.
on Enables clicking
off Disables clicking
-d keyboard device
Specifies the keyboard device being set. The default setting is /dev/kbd.
-D autorepeat delay
Sets the autorepeat delay in milliseconds.
-i
Sets keyboard properties from the keyboard default file. With the exception of -d keyboard device, this option cannot
be used with any other option. The -i option instructs the keyboard command to read and process keyclick and
keyboard abort default values from the /etc/default/kbd file. The -i option can only be used by a user or role with
the Device Security Rights Profile.
-l
Returns the layout code of the keyboard being used, and the autorepeat delay and autorepeat rate being used.
<beginning of page>
If used with -R or -D option, this option returns the value before the changes.
-r
Resets the keyboard as if power-up.
-R autorepeat rate
Sets the autorepeat rate in milliseconds.
-s [language]
Sets the keyboard layout into kernel.
If language is specified, the layout is set to language. If language is not specified, a list of available layouts are pre<hy>
sented, prompting for the user to specify the language. See OPERANDS.
-t
Returns the type of the keyboard being used.
The following operands are supported:
frequency The frequency value specified to be set in kernel. The receiver of this value is specified by the -b option.
This value should be between 0 and 32767 otherwise will be ejected with EINVAL.
language The language specified to be set in kernel. If the language is not found, the languages supported are listed
for selection. It only applies to -s option.

Some server systems have key switches with a secure key position that can be read by system software. This key po<hy>
sition overrides the normal default of the keyboard abort sequence effect and changes the default so the effect is dis<hy>
abled. When the key switch is in the secure position on these systems, the keyboard abort sequence effect cannot be
overridden by the software default, which is settable with the kbd utility.
Currently, there is no way to determine the state of the keyboard click setting.
