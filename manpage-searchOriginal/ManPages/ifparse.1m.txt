/sbin/ifparse [-fs] addr_family commands
Use the ifparse command to parse the ifconfig(1M) command line options and output substrings, one per line, as ap<hy>
propriate. If no options are specified, ifparse returns the entire ifconfig command line as a series of substrings, one
per line.
The ifparse command supports the following options:
-f Lists only substrings of the ifconfig command line that are relevant to IP network multipath failover
-s
 Lists only substrings of the ifconfig command line that are not relevant to IP network multipath failover
The ifparse command does not support the interface operand of the ifconfig command. Example 1 Parsing Com<hy>
mand Line Options Relevant to Failover
The following example shows the use of the ifparse command to parse the command line options relevant to IP net<hy>
work multipath failover:
 example# ifparse -f inet 1.2.3.4 up group one addif 1.2.3.5 -failover up
 set 1.2.3.4 up
Example 2 Parsing Command Line Options That Are Not Relevant to Failover
The following example shows the use of the ifparse command to parse the command line options that are not rele<hy>
vant to IP network multipath failover:
 example# ifparse -s inet 1.2.3.4 up group one addif 1.2.3.5 -failover up
 group one
 addif 1.2.3.5 -failover up
Example 3 Parsing the Command Line For All Options
The following example shows the use of the ifparse command to parse the command line for all ifconfig options:
 example# ifparse inet 1.2.3.4 up group one addif 1.2.3.5 -failover up
 group one
 set 1.2.3.4 up
 addif 1.2.3.5 -failover up

ifconfig(1M), attributes(5)
usage: -fs <addr_family> <commands> Description:
This message indicates an invalid command line.
<beginning of page>
ifparse: Not enough space Description:
This message indicates insufficient memory.
ifparse: dhcp not supported for inet6 Description:
DHCP operations are not supported for the inet6 address family.
ifparse: Operation <operation> not supported for <addr_family> Description:
Most operations cannot be used with all address families. For example, the broadcast operation is not supported on
the inet6 address family.
ifparse: no argument for <operation> Description:
Some operations, for example broadcast, require an argument.
The ifparse command is classified as an obsolete interface. It will likely be removed in a future release. You should
not develop applications that depend upon this interface.
