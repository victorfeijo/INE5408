sckmd <-> Sun cryptographic key management daemon
/usr/platform/sun4u/lib/sckmd
sckmd is a server process that resides on a high-end system domain to maintain the Internet Protocol Security
(IPsec) Security Associations (SAs) needed to secure communications between a Service Processor or System Con<hy>
troller (SC) and platform management software running within a domain. The cvcd(1M) and dcs(1M) daemons use
these Security Associations. See ipsec(7P) for a description of Security Associations.
The sckmd daemon receives SAs from the Service Processor or SC and installs these SAs in a domain's Security
Association Database (SADB) using pf_key(7P).
sckmd starts up at system boot time as an SMF service. The FMRI for the sckmd service is:
 svc:/platform/sun4u/sckmd:default
A domain supports only one running sckmd process at a time.

The sckmd service is used only on Sun Fire high-end systems and the SPARC Enterprise Server family. It provides
a mechanism for exchanging IPsec keys between a domain and its System Controller (SC) or Service Processor.
These platforms use IPsec to secure the communications between the SC or Service Processor and certain platform-
specific daemons in the domain. Such daemons currently include cvcd(1M) and dcs(1M).
The documentation for each platform that supports sckmd describes how to configure its use of IPsec for such com<hy>
munications. Also, the documentation for each specific application describes how to configure its security policies
and IPsec options in a manner appropriate for the target platform. Refer to the platform- and application-specific
documentation for detailed information.
