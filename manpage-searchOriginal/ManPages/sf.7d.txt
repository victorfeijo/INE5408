sf <-> SOC+ FC-AL FCP Driver
sf@port,0
The sf driver is a SCSA compliant nexus driver which supports the Fibre Channel Protocol for SCSI on Private Fi<hy>
bre Channel Arbitrated loops. An SBus card called the SOC+ card (see socal(7D)) connects the Fibre Channel loop
to the host system.
The sf driver interfaces with the SOC+ device driver, socal(7D), the SCSI disk target driver, ssd(7D), and the SC<hy>
SI-3 Enclosure Services driver, ses(7D). It only supports SCSI devices of type disk and ses.
The sf driver supports the standard functions provided by the SCSA interface. The driver supports auto request
sense and tagged queueing by default.
The driver requires that all devices have unique hard addresses defined by switch settings in hardware. Devices with
conflicting hard addresses will not be accessible.

Fibre Channel Private Loop SCSI Direct Attach (FC-PLDA)
In addition to being logged, the messages below may display on the system console.
The first set of messages indicate that the attachment was unsuccessful, and will only display while the sf driver is
initially attempting to attach. Each message is preceded by sf%d , where %d is the instance number of the sf de<hy>
vice.
Failed to alloc soft state
Driver was unable to allocate space for the internal state structure. Driver did not attach to device, SCSI devices will
be inaccessible.
Bad soft state
Driver requested an invalid internal state structure. Driver did not attach to device, SCSI devices will be inaccessible.
Failed to obtain transport handle
Driver was unable to obtain a transport handle to communicate with the socal driver. Driver did not attach to device,
SCSI devices will be inaccessible

Failed to allocate command/response pool
Driver was unable to allocate space for commands and responses. Driver did not attach to device, SCSI devices will
be inaccessible.
Failed to allocate kmem cache
Driver was unable to allocate space for the packet cache. Driver did not attach to device, SCSI devices will be inac<hy>
cessible.
Failed to allocate dma handle for
Driver was unable to allocate a dma handle for the loop map. Driver did not attach to device, SCSI devices will be
inaccessible.
Failed to allocate lilp map

Failed to bind dma handle for
Driver was unable to bind a dma handle for the loop map. Driver did not attach to device, SCSI devices will be inac<hy>
cessible.
Failed to attach
Driver was unable to attach for some reason that may be printed. Driver did not attach to device, SCSI devices will
be inaccessible.
The next set of messages may display at any time. The full device pathname, followed by the shorter form de<hy>
scribed above, will precede the message.
Invalid lilp map
The driver did not obtain a valid lilp map from the socal driver. SCSI device will be inaccessible.
Target t, AL-PA x and hard
The device with a switch setting t has an AL-PA x which does not match its hard address y. The device will not be
accessible.
Duplicate switch settings
The driver detected devices with the same switch setting. All such devices will be inaccessible.
WWN changed on target t
The World Wide Name (WWN) has changed on the device with switch setting t.
Target t, unknown device type
The driver does not know the device type reported by the device with switch setting t.
