DAT_RETURN
 dat_evd_disable(
 IN DAT_EVD_HANDLE evd_handle
 )
evd_handle Handle for an instance of Event Dispatcher.
The dat_evd_disable() function disables the Event Dispatcher so that the arrival of an event does not affect the asso<hy>
ciated CNO.
If the Event Dispatcher is already disabled, this operation is no-op.
Events arriving on this EVD might cause waiters on the associated CNO to be awakened after the return of this rou<hy>
tine because an unblocking a CNO waiter is already "in progress" at the time this routine is called or returned.
DAT_SUCCESS The operation was successful.
DAT_INVALID_HANDLE The evd_handle parameter is invalid.
