msgb, mblk <-> STREAMS message block structure
#include <sys/stream.h>
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI)
A STREAMS message is made up of one or more message blocks, referenced by a pointer to a msgb structure. The
b_next and b_prev pointers are used to link messages together on a QUEUE. The b_cont pointer links message
blocks together when a message consists of more than one block.
Each msgb structure also includes a pointer to a datab(9S) structure, the data block (which contains pointers to the
actual data of the message), and the type of the message.
 struct msgb *b_next; /* next message on queue */
 struct msgb *b_prev; /* previous message on queue */
 struct msgb *b_cont; /* next message block */
 unsigned char *b_rptr; /* 1st unread data byte of buffer */
 unsigned char *b_wptr; /* 1st unwritten data byte of buffer */
 struct datab *b_datap; /* pointer to data block */
 unsigned char b_band; /* message priority */
 unsigned short b_flag; /* used by stream head */
Valid flags are as follows:
MSGMARK Last byte of message is marked.
MSGDELIM Message is delimited.
The msgb structure is defined as type mblk_t.
