nfsmapid <-> NFS user and group id mapping daemon
/usr/lib/nfs/nfsmapid
The nfsmapid daemon maps to and from NFS version 4 owner and owner_group identification attributes and local
UID and GID numbers used by both the NFS version 4 client and server.
nfsmapid uses the passwd and group entries in the /etc/nsswitch.conf file to direct how it performs the mappings.
The nfsmapid daemon has no external, customer-accessible interfaces. You can, however, administratively configure
nfsmapid in one of the following ways: <bu> Specify the NFSMAPID_DOMAIN parameter in nfs(4) <bu> Specify the
_nfsv4idmapdomain DNS resource record.
Please refer to the for further details.
See attributes(5) for descriptions of the following attributes:

share_nfs(1M), userdel(1M), usermod(1M), nfs(4), attributes(5), smf(5)

The nfsmapid service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/network/nfs/mapid
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). The service's status can be queried using the svcs(1) command.
If it is disabled, it will be enabled by mount_nfs(1M), share_nfs(1M), and automountd(1M), unless its appli<hy>
cation/auto_enable property is set to false.
nfsmapid caches a user's UID and GID. If a user subsequently changes a UID or GID, using one of the utilities list<hy>
ed below, the nfsmapid cache becomes stale. At this point, any NFS operation that gets or set attributes will result in
the exchange of this stale information. To resolve this situation, restart nfsmapid, as follows:
 # svcadm restart svc:/network/nfs/mapid:default
The utilities that allow you to change UID and GID are: <bu> usermod(1M) <bu> userdel(1M) <bu> groupmod(1M) <bu>
groupdel(1M) <bu> passmgmt(1M)
The nfsmapid daemon might not exist in a future release of Solaris.
