imqkeytool <-> generate a self-signed certificate for secure communication
/usr/bin/imqkeytool [-broker] [-servlet keystore_location]
/usr/bin/imqkeytool -h
The imqkeytool utility generates a self-signed certificate for secure communication. The certificate can be used by a
broker instance to establish a secure connection with a client, or by a Message Queue-supplied HTTPS servlet to es<hy>
tablish a secure connection with a broker instance. An HTTPS servlet is an SSL-enabled varient of the HyperText
Transfer Protocol that establishes a secure connection with a broker instance.
Without an option, imqkeytool generates a self-signed certificate for a broker instance.
imqkeytool uses command line options to specify whether the certificate is used by a broker instance or by a servlet.
The following options are supported:
-broker Generate a self-signed certificate for the broker and places it in the Message Queue keystore. All broker in<hy>
stances running on a system must use the same certificate.
-h Display usage help. Do not execute anything else on the command line.
-servlet keystore_location Generate a self-signed certificate for an HTTPS servlet and places it in keystore_location.
keystore_location refers to the location of the keystore. You should move this keystore to a location where it is ac<hy>
cessible and readable by the Message Queue HTTPS servlet to establish a secure connection with a broker.
