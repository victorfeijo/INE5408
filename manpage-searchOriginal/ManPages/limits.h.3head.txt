limits.h, limits <-> implementation-defined constants
#include <limits.h>
The <limits.h> header defines various symbolic names. Different categories of names are described below.
The names represent various limits on resources that the implementation imposes on applications. Symbolic constant
names beginning with _POSIX can be found in unistd.h(3HEAD).
Applications should not assume any particular value for a limit. An application wishing to avail itself of the full
amount of a resource available on an implementation can make use of the value given in limits.h on that particular
implementation by using the symbolic names listed below. Many of the listed limits are not invariant, and at runtime,
the value of the limit might differ from those given in this header, for the following reasons: <bu> The limit is pathname-
dependent. <bu> The limit differs between the compile and runtime machines.
For these reasons, an application can use the fpathconf(2), pathconf(2), and sysconf(3C) functions to determine the
actual value of a limit at runtime.
