The ddi_get_eventcookie() function queries the device tree for a cookie matching the given event name and returns
a reference to that cookie. The search is performed by a calling up the device tree hierarchy until the request is satis<hy>

The cookie returned by this function can be used to register a callback handler, unregister a callback handler, or post
an event.
DDI_SUCCESS Cookie handle is returned.
DDI_FAILURE Request was not serviceable by any nexus driver in the driver's ancestral device tree hierarchy.
