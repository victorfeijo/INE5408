spray <-> spray packets
/usr/sbin/spray [-c count] [-d delay] [-l length]
 [-t nettype] host
spray sends a one-way stream of packets to host using RPC, and reports how many were received, as well as the
transfer rate. The host argument can be either a name or an Internet address.
spray is not useful as a networking benchmark, as it uses unreliable connectionless transports, UDP for example.
spray can report a large number of packets dropped when the drops were caused by spray sending packets faster
than they can be buffered locally, that is, before the packets get to the network medium.
-c count Specify how many packets to send. The default value of count is the number of packets required to make
the total stream size 100000 bytes.
-d delay Specify how many microseconds to pause between sending each packet. The default is 0.
-l length The length parameter is the numbers of bytes in the Ethernet packet that holds the RPC call message. Since
the data is encoded using XDR, and XDR only deals with 32 bit quantities, not all values of length are possible, and
spray rounds up to the nearest possible value. When length is greater than 1514, then the RPC call can no longer be
encapsulated in one Ethernet packet, so the length field no longer has a simple correspondence to Ethernet packet
size. The default value of length is 86 bytes, the size of the RPC and UDP headers.
-t nettype Specify class of transports. Defaults to netpath. See rpc(3NSL) for a description of supported classes.
