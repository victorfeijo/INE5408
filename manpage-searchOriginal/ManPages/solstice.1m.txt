The Solstice Launcher adds or removes local applications that are private to the user (not local to the system) only.
The properties of globally registered applications that are used by local and remote users sharing the software from a
particular /opt directory cannot be modified from the Solstice Launcher. To register global applications for use by
local and remote users, use the soladdapp(1M) command. To remove globally registered applications, use the solde<hy>
lapp(1M) command.
