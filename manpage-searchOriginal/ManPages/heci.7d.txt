The Intel AMT Manageability Interface driver is meant to be used by the Local Manageability Service. When the In<hy>
tel AMT machine is in Legacy Mode, the Intel AMT Manageability Interface driver functions. Messages from the
Intel AMT Manageability Interface driver are sent to the system's log, that is, /var/log/messages.
