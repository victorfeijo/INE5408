curs_inswch, inswch, winswch, mvinswch, mvwinswch <-> insert a wchar_t character before the character under the
cursor in a curses window

#include <curses.h>
int inswch(chtype wch);
int winswch(WINDOW *win, chtype wch);
int mvinswch(int y, int x, chtype wch);
int mvwinswch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, chtype wch);
These routines insert the character wch, holding a wchar_t character, before the character under the cursor. All
characters to the right of the cursor are moved one space to the right, with the possibility of the rightmost character
on the line being lost. The cursor position does not change (after moving to y, x, if specified). (This does not imply
use of the hardware insert character feature.)
All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.

The header file <curses.h> automatically includes the header files <stdio.h>, <unctrl.h> and <widec.h>.
Note that inswch(), mvinswch(), and mvwinswch() may be macros.
None of these routines can use the color attribute in chtype.
