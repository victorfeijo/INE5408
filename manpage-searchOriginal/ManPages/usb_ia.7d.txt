usb_ia <-> USB interface association driver
interface association@unit-address
The usb_ia driver is a USBA (Solaris Universal Serial Bus Architecture)-compliant nexus driver that binds to a de<hy>
vice's interface association nodes when no vendor or class specific driver is available. To do this, usb_ia creates
nodes for the internal interfaces and then attempts to bind drivers to each child interface.
Each interface association node has a parent device node that is created by usb_mid(7D) and all ugen(7D) inter<hy>
faces are exported by usb_mid(7D). (Note: attempting to export ugen(7D) interfaces using usb_ia is prohibited.)
