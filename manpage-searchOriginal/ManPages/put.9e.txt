q Pointer to the queue(9S) structure.
mp Pointer to the message block.
The primary task of the put() routine is to coordinate the passing of messages from one queue to the next in a
stream. The put() routine is called by the preceding stream component (stream module, driver, or stream head).
put() routines are designated ``write'' or ``read'' depending on the direction of message flow.
With few exceptions, a streams module or driver must have a put() routine. One exception is the read side of a driv<hy>
er, which does not need a put() routine because there is no component downstream to call it. The put() routine is al<hy>
ways called before the component's corresponding srv(9E) (service) routine, and so put() should be used for the im<hy>
mediate processing of messages.
A put() routine must do at least one of the following when it receives a message: <bu> pass the message to the next com<hy>
ponent on the stream by calling the putnext(9F) function; <bu> process the message, if immediate processing is required
(for example, to handle high priority messages); or <bu> enqueue the message (with the putq(9F) function) for deferred
processing by the service srv(9E) routine.
Typically, a put() routine will switch on message type, which is contained in the db_type member of the datab
structure pointed to by mp. The action taken by the put() routine depends on the message type. For example, a put()
routine might process high priority messages, enqueue normal messages, and handle an unrecognized M_IOCTL
message by changing its type to M_IOCNAK (negative acknowledgement) and sending it back to the stream head
using the qreply(9F) function.
The putq(9F) function can be used as a module's put() routine when no special processing is required and all mes<hy>
sages are to be enqueued for the srv(9E) routine.
Ignored.
put() routines do not have user context.
