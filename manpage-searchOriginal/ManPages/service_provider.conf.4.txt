service_provider.conf
service_provider.conf contains information about the device type that the service provider supports. This informa<hy>
tion includes the pathname of the service provider library, the library version and other library characteristics that are
required by the system administrative command, datadm(1M). datadm(1M) puts this information in the DAT static
register file, dat.conf(4).
The datadm program enumerates each device entry into a list of interface adapters, that is, interfaces to external net<hy>
work that are available to uDAPL consumers. This new list of interface adapters is appended to other service
providers' information in the DAT static registry, dat.conf. You can do this is you invoke the datadm program with
the -a option and the pathname of the service_provider.conf file.
Each entry in the service_provider.conf is a single line of 7 fields.
The following shows the order of the fields in a service_provider.conf entry:
 "driver_name" "API_version" "threadsafe_library | \
  nonthreadsafe_library"\
 "default_version | nondefault_version" \
  "service_provider_library_pathname"\
 "service_provider_version" "service_provider_instance_data"\
The fields are defined as follows:
driver_name
Specifies a driver name in the format of driver_name=value pair, for example, driver_name=tavor.
API_version
Specifies the API version of the service provide library: For example, "u"major.minor is u1.2.
threadsafe_library | nonthreadsafe_librar
Specifies a threadsafe or non-threadsafe library.
default_version | nondefault_version
Specifies a default or non-default version of library. A service provider can offer several versions of the library. If so,
one version is designated as default with the rest as nondefault.
service_provider_library_pathname
Specifies the pathname of the library image.
service_provider_version
Specifies the version of the service provider. By convention, specify the company stock symbol as the service
provider, followed by major and minor version numbers, for example, SUNW1.0.
service_provider_instance_data
Specifies the service provider instance data.
Example 1 Using a Logical Device Name
The following example service_provider.conf entry uses a logical device name:
 #
<beginning of page>
 # Sample service_provider.conf entry showing an uDAPL 1.2 service
 # provider, udapl_tavor.so.1 supporting a device with a driver named
 # tavor
 driver_name=tavor u1.2 nonthreadsafe default udapl_tavor.so.1 \
  SUNW.1.0 ""
Example 2 Using a Physical Device Name
The following example service_provider.conf uses a physical device name:
 #
 # Sample service_provider.conf entry showing an uDAPL 1.2
 # service provider, udapl_tavor.so.1 supporting a device named
 # pci15b3,5a44 that can be located under /devices
 #
 pci15b3,5a44 u1.2 nonthreadsafe default \
  /usr/lib/tavor/udapl_tavor.so.1 SUNWudaplt1.0 ""
