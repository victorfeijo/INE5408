hermon <-> ConnectX MT25408/MT25418/MT25428 InfiniBand (IB) Driver
The hermon driver is an IB Architecture-compliant implementation of an HCA, which operates on the Mellanox
MT25408, MT25418 and MT25428 InfiniBand ASSPs using host memory for context storage rather than locally
attached memory on the card. Cards based on these ASSP's utilize the PCI-Express I/O bus. These ASSP's sup<hy>
port the link and physical layers of the InfiniBand specification while the ASSP and the driver support the trans<hy>
port layer.
The hermon driver interfaces with the InfiniBand Transport Framework (IBTF) and provides an implementation of
the Channel Interfaces that are defined by that framework. It also enables management applications and agents to
access the IB fabric.

Writing Device Drivers
In addition to being logged, the following messages may appear on the system console:
hermoni: driver attached for maintenance mode only.
There was a failure in the boot process of the hermon ASSP and the only function that can be performed is to re-
flash firmware on the ASSP. (Note that i represents the instance of the hermon device number.)
hermoni: driver failed to attach
The ASSP could not boot into either operational (HCA) mode or into maintenance mode. The device is inoperable.
(Note that i represents the instance of the hermon device number.)
Unexpected port number in port state change event.
A port state change event occurred, but the port number in the message does not exist on this HCA. This message
also indicates the port number that was in the port state changed.
Hermon driver successfully detached.
The driver has been removed from the system and the HCA is no longer available for transfer operations.
<beginning of page>
hermoni: port m up.
A port up asynchronous event has occurred. (Note that i represents the instance of the Hermon device number
while "m" represents the port number on the Hermon device.
hermoni: port m down.
A port up asynchronous event has occurred. Similar to port up event.
hermon: <command name> command failed.
A internal firmware command failed to execute.
