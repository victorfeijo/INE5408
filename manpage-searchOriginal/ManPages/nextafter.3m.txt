double nextafter(double x, double y);
float nextafterf(float x, float y);
long double nextafterl(long double x, long double y);
double nexttoward(double x, long double y);
float nexttowardf(float x, long double y);
long double nexttowardl(long double x, long double y);
The nextafter(), nextafterf(), and nextafterl() functions compute the next representable floating-point value follow<hy>
ing x in the direction of y. Thus, if y is less than x, nextafter() returns the largest representable floating-point number
less than x. The nextafter(), nextafterf(), and nextafterl() functions return y if x equals y.
The nexttoward(), nexttowardf(), and nexttowardl() functions are equivalent to the corresponding nextafter()
functions, except that the second parameter has type long double and the functions return y converted to the type of
the function if x equals y.
Upon successful completion, these functions return the next representable floating-point value following x in the di<hy>
rection of y.
If x == y, y (of the type x) is returned.
If x is finite and the correct function value would overflow, a range error occurs and <+->HUGE_VAL,
<+->HUGE_VALF, and <+->HUGE_VALL (with the same sign as x) is returned as appropriate for the return type of the
function.
If x or y is NaN, a NaN is returned.
If x != y and the correct function value is subnormal, zero, or underflows, a range error occurs and either the correct
function value (if representable) or 0.0 is returned.
These functions will fail if:
Range Error The correct value overflows.
If the integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, the overflow floating-point ex<hy>
ception is raised.
The nextafter() function sets errno to ERANGE if the correct value would overflow.
Range Error The correct value underflows.
If the integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, the underflow floating-point
exception is raised.
An application wanting to check for exceptions should call feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these
functions. On return, if fetestexcept(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDER<hy>
FLOW) is non-zero, an exception has been raised. An application should either examine the return value or check
the floating point exception flags to detect exceptions.
An application can also set errno to 0 before calling nextafter(). On return, if errno is non-zero, an error has oc<hy>
curred. The nextafterf(), nextafterl(). nexttoward(), nexttowardf(), and nexttowardl() functions do not set errno.
