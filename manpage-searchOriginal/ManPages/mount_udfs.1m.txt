mount -F udfs [generic_options] [-o specific_options]
 [-O] special | mount_point
The mount utility attaches a udfs file system to the file system hierarchy at the mount_point, which is the pathname
of a directory. If mount_point has any contents prior to the mount operation, these are hidden until the file system is
unmounted.
If mount is invoked with either special or mount_point as the only arguments, mount searches /etc/vfstab to fill in
the missing arguments, including the specific_options. See mount(1M).
The udfs file system supports direct mounting of files containing the file system as well as block devices. See
mount(1M) and lofiadm(1M).
If special and mount_point are specified without any specific_options, the default is rw.
If the directory on which a file system is to be mounted is a symbolic link, the file system is mounted on the directo<hy>
ry to which the symbolic link refers, rather than on top of the symbolic link itself.
See mount(1M) for the list of supported generic_options.
The following options are supported:
-o specific_options
Specify udfs file system specific options in a comma-separated list with no intervening spaces. The following specif<hy>
ic_options are available:
m
Mount the file system without making an entry in /etc/mnttab.
remount
Remount the file system as read-write. The option is used in conjunction with the rw option.
A file system mounted read-only can be remounted as read-write. This option fails if the file system is not currently
mounted.
-O
Overlay mount. Allow the file system to be mounted over an existing mount point, making the underlying file sys<hy>
tem inaccessible. If a mount is attempted on a pre-existing mount point without setting this flag, the mount fails, pro<hy>
ducing the error device busy.

tributes(5)
not super user
The command is run by a non-root user. Run as root.
no such device
The device name specified does not exist.
not a directory
The specified mount point is not a directory.
is not an udfs file system
The device specified does not contain a udf 1.50 file system or the udfs file system module is not available.
is already mounted
The specified device is already in use.
not a block device
The device specified is not a block device. Use block device to mount.
write-protected
The device is read-only.
is corrupted. needs checking
The file system is in an inconsistent state. Run fsck.
Copy-protected files can be stored on DVD-ROM media using Universal Disk Format (UDF). Reading these copy-
protected files is not possible as this involves an authentication process. Unless an authentication process between
the host and the drive is completed, reading these copy-protected files after mounting and before the authentication
process, returns an error.
