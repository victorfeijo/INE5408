q Pointer to the queue.
The noenable() function prevents the q from being scheduled for service by insq(9F), putq(9F) or putbq(9F) when
enqueuing an ordinary priority message. The queue can be re-enabled with the enableok(9F) function.
The noenable() function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context.
