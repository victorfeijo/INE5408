 [pattern]
The pgrep utility examines the active processes on the system and reports the process IDs of the processes whose at<hy>
tributes match the criteria specified on the command line. Each process ID is printed as a decimal value and is sepa<hy>
rated from the next ID by a delimiter string, which defaults to a newline. For each attribute option, the user can spec<hy>
ify a set of possible values separated by commas on the command line. For example,
 pgrep -G other,daemon
matches processes whose real group ID is other OR daemon. If multiple criteria options are specified, pgrep
matches processes whose attributes match the logical AND of the criteria options. For example,
 pgrep -G other,daemon -U root,daemon
matches processes whose attributes are:
 (real group ID is other OR daemon) AND
 (real user ID is root OR daemon)
pkill functions identically to pgrep, except that each matching process is signaled as if by kill(1) instead of having
its process ID printed. A signal name or number may be specified as the first command line option to pkill.
The following options are supported:
-c ctidlist Matches only processes whose process contract ID is in the given list.
-d delim Specifies the output delimiter string to be printed between each matching process ID. If no -d option is
specified, the default is a newline character. The -d option is only valid when specified as an option to pgrep.
-f The regular expression pattern should be matched against the full process argument string (obtained from the
pr_psargs field of the /proc/nnnnn/psinfo file). If no -f option is specified, the expression is matched only against
the name of the executable file (obtained from the pr_fname field of the /proc/nnnnn/psinfo file).
-g pgrplist Matches only processes whose process group ID is in the given list. If group 0 is included in the list, this
is interpreted as the process group ID of the pgrep or pkill process.
-G gidlist Matches only processes whose real group ID is in the given list. Each group ID may be specified as either
a group name or a numerical group ID.
-J projidlist Matches only processes whose project ID is in the given list. Each project ID may be specified as either
a project name or a numerical project ID.
-l Long output format. Prints the process name along with the process ID of each matching process. The process
name is obtained from the pr_psargs or pr_fname field, depending on whether the -f option was specified (see
above). The -l option is only valid when specified as an option to pgrep.

-n Matches only the newest (most recently created) process that meets all other specified matching criteria. Cannot
be used with option -o.
-o Matches only the oldest (earliest created) process that meets all other specified matching criteria. Cannot be used
with option -n.
-P ppidlist Matches only processes whose parent process ID is in the given list.
-s sidlist Matches only processes whose process session ID is in in the given list. If ID 0 is included in the list, this is
interpreted as the session ID of the pgrep or pkill process.
-t termlist Matches only processes which are associated with a terminal in the given list. Each terminal is specified
as the suffix following "/dev/" of the terminal's device path name in /dev. For example, term/a or pts/0.
-T taskidlist Matches only processes whose task ID is in the given list. If ID 0 is included in the list, this is interpret<hy>
ed as the task ID of the pgrep or pkill process.
-u euidlist Matches only processes whose effective user ID is in the given list. Each user ID may be specified as ei<hy>
ther a login name or a numerical user ID.
-U uidlist Matches only processes whose real user ID is in the given list. Each user ID may be specified as either a
login name or a numerical user ID.
-v Reverses the sense of the matching. Matches all processes except those which meet the specified matching crite<hy>
ria.
-x Considers only processes whose argument string or executable file name exactly matches the specified pattern to
be matching processes. The pattern match is considered to be exact when all characters in the process argument
string or executable file name match the pattern.
-z zoneidlist Matches only processes whose zone ID is in the given list. Each zone ID may be specified as either a
zone name or a numerical zone ID. This option is only useful when executed in the global zone. If the pkill utility is
used to send signals to processes in other zones, the process must have asserted the {PRIV_PROC_ZONE} privi<hy>
lege (see privileges(5)).
-signal Specifies the signal to send to each matched process. If no signal is specified, SIGTERM is sent by default.
The value of signal can be one of the symbolic names defined in signal.h(3HEAD) without the SIG prefix, or the
corresponding signal number as a decimal value. The -signal option is only valid when specified as the first option to
pkill.
The following operand is supported:
pattern Specifies an Extended Regular Expression (ERE) pattern to match against either the executable file name or
full process argument string. See regex(5) for a complete description of the ERE syntax.
Example 1 Obtaining a Process ID
Obtain the process ID of sendmail:
 example% pgrep -x -u root sendmail
 283
<beginning of page>
Example 2 Terminating a Process
Terminate the most recently created xterm:
 example% pkill -n xterm
The following exit values are returned:
0 One or more processes were matched.
1 No processes were matched.
2 Invalid command line options were specified.
3 A fatal error occurred.

Both utilities match the ERE pattern argument against either the pr_fname or pr_psargs fields of the
/proc/nnnnn/psinfo files. The lengths of these strings are limited according to definitions in <sys/procfs.h>. Patterns
which can match strings longer than the current limits may fail to match the intended set of processes.
If the pattern argument contains ERE meta-characters which are also shell meta-characters, it may be necessary to
enclose the pattern with appropriate shell quotes.
Defunct processes are never matched by either pgrep or pkill.
The current pgrep or pkill process will never consider itself a potential match.
