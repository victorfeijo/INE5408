The dca device driver is a multi-threaded, loadable hardware driver supporting Sun PCI-based (pci108e,5454) cryp<hy>
tographic accelerators, such as the Sun Crypto Accelerator 1000.
The dca driver requires the presence of Solaris Cryptographic Framework for applications and kernel clients to ac<hy>
cess the provided services.
The dca driver maintains the following statistics:
3desjobs Total number of jobs submitted to the device for 3DES encryption.
3desbytes Total number of bytes submitted to the device for 3DES encryption.
rsapublic Total number of jobs submitted to the device for RSA public key operations.
rsaprivate Total number of jobs submitted to the device for RSA private key operations.
dsasign Total number of jobs submitted to the device for DSA signing.
dsaverify Total number of jobs submitted to the device for DSA verification.
rngjobs Total number of jobs submitted for pure entropy generation.
rngbytes Total number of bytes of pure entropy requested from the device.
rngsha1jobs Total number of jobs submitted for entropy generation, with SHA-1 post-processing.
rngsha1bytes Total number of bytes of entropy requested from the device, with SHA-1 post-processing.
Additional statistics may be supplied for Sun support personnel, but are not useful to end users and are not docu<hy>
mented here.
The dca driver can be configured by defining properties in /kernel/drv/dca.conf which override the default settings.
The following properties are supported:
nostats Disables the generation of statistics. This property may be used to help prevent traffic analysis, but this may
inhibit support personnel.
rngdirect Disables the SHA-1 post-processing of generated entropy. This may give "truer" random numbers, but it
may also introduce the risk of external biases influencing the distribution of generated random numbers.
