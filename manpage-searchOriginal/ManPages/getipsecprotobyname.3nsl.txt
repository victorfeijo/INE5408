Use the getipsecprotobyname() and getipsecprotobynum() functions to obtain the IPsec algorithm mappings that
are defined by ipsecalgs(1M). You can also use the getipsecprotobyname() and getipsecprotobynum() functions in
conjunction with getipsecalgbyname(3NSL) and getipsecalgbynum(3NSL) to obtain information about the sup<hy>
ported IPsec algorithms. The IPsec algorithms and associated protocol name spaces are defined by RFC 2407.
getipsecprotobyname() takes as an argument the name of an IPsec protocol and returns its assigned protocol num<hy>
ber. The character string returned by the getipsecprotobyname() function must be freed by the called when it is no
longer needed.
getipsecprotobynum() takes as an argument a protocol number and returns the corresponding protocol name.
The following protocol numbers are pre-defined:
IPSEC_PROTO_ESP Defines the encryption algorithms (transforms) that can be used by IPsec to provide data
confidentiality.
IPSEC_PROTO_AH Defines the authentication algorithms (transforms) that can be used by IPsec to provide au<hy>
thentication.
proto_name A pointer to the name of an IPsec protocol.
proto_num A pointer to a protocol number. conditions.
The getipsecprotobyname() function returns a protocol number upon success, or -1 if the protocol specified does
not exist.
 The getipsecprotobynum() function returns a protocol name upon success, or the NULL value if the protocol num<hy>
ber specified does not exist.
