ttyslot <-> find the slot of the current user in the user accounting database
#include <stdlib.h>
int ttyslot(void);
The ttyslot() function returns the index of the current user's entry in the user accounting database, /var/adm/utmpx.
The current user's entry is an entry for which the utline member matches the name of a terminal device associated
with any of the process's file descriptors 0, 1 or 2. The index is an ordinal number representing the record number in
the database of the current user's entry. The first entry in the database is represented by the return value 0.
Upon successful completion, ttyslot() returns the index of the current user's entry in the user accounting database. If
an error was encountered while searching for the terminal name or if none of the above file descriptors are associat<hy>
ed with a terminal device, <mi>1 is returned.
