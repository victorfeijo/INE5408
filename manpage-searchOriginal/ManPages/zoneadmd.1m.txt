zoneadmd <-> zone administration daemon
/usr/lib/zones/zoneadmd
zoneadmd is a system daemon that is started when the system needs to manage a particular zone. Because each in<hy>
stance of the zoneadmd daemon manages a particular zone, it is not unexpected to see multiple zoneadmd daemons
running.
This daemon is started automatically by the zone management software and should not be invoked directly. The dae<hy>
mon shuts down automatically when no longer in use. It does not constitute a programming interface, but is classi<hy>
fied as a private interface.
