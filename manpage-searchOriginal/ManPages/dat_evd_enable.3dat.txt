 dat_evd_enable(
 IN DAT_EVD_HANDLE evd_handle
 )
evd_handle Handle for an instance of Event Dispatcher.
The dat_evd_enable() function enables the Event Dispatcher so that the arrival of an event can trigger the associated
CNO. The enabling and disabling EVD has no effect on direct waiters on the EVD. However, direct waiters effec<hy>
tively take ownership of the EVD, so that the specified CNO is not triggered even if is enabled.
If the Event Dispatcher is already enabled, this operation is no-op.
DAT_SUCCESS The operation was successful.
DAT_INVALID_HANDLE The evd_handle parameter is invalid.
