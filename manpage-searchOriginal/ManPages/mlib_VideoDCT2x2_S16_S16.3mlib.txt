 const mlib_s16 block[4]);
The mlib_VideoDCT2x2_S16_S16() function computes the forward DCT for the destination DCT coefficients of
data type mlib_s16 and a source block of data type mlib_s16. The input to the DCT routine is the difference between
the current block and the reference block. The difference pixel can occupy nine bits and is represented as a 16-bit da<hy>
tum. The source and destination buffer addresses must be 8-byte aligned.
The function takes the following arguments:
coeffs Pointer to the destination DCT coefficients. coeffs must be 8-byte aligned.
block Pointer to an 2x2 motion-compensated block that is the difference between the reference block and the current
block. block must be 8-byte aligned.
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
