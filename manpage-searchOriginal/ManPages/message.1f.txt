message <-> puts its arguments on FMLI message line
message [-t] [-b [num]] [-o] [-w] [string]
message [-f] [-b [num]] [-o] [-w] [string]
message [-p] [-b [num]] [-o] [-w] [string]
The message command puts string out on the FMLI message line. If there is no string, the stdin input to message
will be used. The output of message has a duration (length of time it remains on the message line). The default dura<hy>
tion is "transient": it or one of two other durations can be requested with the mutually-exclusive options below.
Messages displayed with message -p will replace (change the value of) any message currently displayed or stored
via use of the permanentmsg descriptor. Likewise, message -f will replace any message currently displayed or
stored via use of the framemsg descriptor. If more than one message in a frame definition file is specified with the
-p option, the last one specified will be the permanent duration message.
The string argument should always be the last argument.
-t Explicitly defines a message to have transient duration. Transient messages remain on the message line only until
the user presses another key or a CHECKWORLD occurs. The descriptors itemmsg , fieldmsg , invalidmsg ,
choicemsg , the default-if-not-defined value of oninterrupt , and FMLI generated error messages (that is, from syn<hy>
tax errors) also output transient duration messages. Transient messages take precedence over both frame messages
and permanent messages.
-f Defines a message to have "frame" duration. Frame messages remain on the message line as long as the frame in
which they are defined is current. The descriptor framemsg also outputs a frame duration message. Frame messages
take precedence over permanent messages.
-p Defines a message to have "permanent" duration. Permanent messages remain on the message line for the length
of the FMLI session, unless explicitly replaced by another permanent message or temporarily superseded by a tran<hy>
sient message or frame message. A permanent message is not affected by navigating away from, or by closing, the
frame which generated the permanent message. The descriptor permanentmsg also outputs a permanent duration
message.
-b[num] Rings the terminal bell num times, where num is an integer from 1 to 10. The default value is 1. If the ter<hy>
minal has no bell, the screen will flash num times instead, if possible.
-o Forces message to duplicate its message to stdout .
-w Turns on the working indicator.
Example 1 A sample output of message on the message line:
When a value entered in a field is invalid, ring the bell 3 times and then display Invalid Entry: Try again! on the
message line:
 invalidmsg=`message -b 3 "Invalid Entry: Try again!"`
Display a message that tells the user what is being done:
 done=`message EDITOR has been set in your environment` close
Display a message on the message line and stdout for each field in a form (a pseudo-"field duration" message).
<beginning of page>
 fieldmsg="`message -o -f "Enter a filename."`"
Display a blank transient message (effect is to "remove" a permanent or frame duration message).
 done=`message ""` nop

If message is coded more than once on a single line, it may appear that only the right-most instance is interpreted
and displayed. Use sleep(1) between uses of message in this case, to display multiple messages.
message -f should not be used in a stand-alone backquoted expression or with the init descriptor because the frame
is not yet current when these are evaluated.
In cases where `message -f "string"` is part of a stand-alone backquoted expression, the context for evaluation of
the expression is the previously current frame. The previously current frame can be the frame that issued the open
command for the frame containing the backquoted expression, or it can be a frame given as an argument when fmli
was invoked. That is, the previously current frame is the one whose frame message will be modified.
Permanent duration messages are displayed when the user navigates to the command line.
