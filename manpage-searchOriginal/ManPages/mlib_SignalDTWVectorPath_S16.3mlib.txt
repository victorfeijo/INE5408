The mlib_SignalDTWVectorPath_S16() function performs dynamic time warping on vector data.
Assume the reference data are
  r(y), y=1,2,...,N
and the observed data are
  o(x), x=1,2,...,M
the dynamic time warping is to find a mapping function (a path)
  p(i) = {px(i),py(i)}, i=1,2,...,Q
with the minimum distance.
In K-best paths case, K paths with the K minimum distances are searched.
The distance of a path is defined as
  Q
  dist = SUM d(r(py(i)),o(px(i))) * m(px(i),py(i))
  i=1
where d(r,o) is the dissimilarity between data point/vector r and data point/vector o; m(x,y) is the path weighting co<hy>
efficient associated with path point (x,y); N is the length of the reference data; M is the length of the observed data;
Q is the length of the path.
Using L1 norm (sum of absolute differences)
  L-1
  d(r,o) = SUM |r(i) - o(i)|
  i=0
Using L2 norm (Euclidean distance)
  L-1
  d(r,o) = SQRT { SUM (r(i) - o(i))**2 }
  i=0
where L is the length of each data vector.
To scalar data where L=1, the two norms are the same.
  d(r,o) = |r - o| = SQRT {(r - o)**2 }
The constraints of dynamic time warping are: 1. Endpoint constraints
  px(1) = 1
  1 <<=> py(1) <<=> 1 + delta
<beginning of page>
and
  px(Q) = M
  N-delta <<=> py(Q) <<=> N
2. Monotonicity Conditions
  px(i) <<=> px(i+1)
  py(i) <<=> py(i+1)
3. Local Continuity Constraints
See Table 4.5 on page 211 in Rabiner and Juang's book.

Allowable paths are
  p1->p0 (1,0)
  p2->p0 (1,1)
  p3->p0 (1,2)
Consecutive (1,0)(1,0) is disallowed. So path p4->p1->p0 is disallowed. 4. Global Path Constraints
Due to local continuity constraints, certain portions of the (px,py) plane are excluded from the region the optimal
warping path can traverse. This forms global path constraints. 5. Slope Weighting
See Equation 4.150-3 on page 216 in Rabiner and Juang's book.
A path in (px,py) plane can be represented in chain code. The value of the chain code is defined as following.
  ============================
  shift ( x , y ) | chain code
  ----------------------------
  ( 1 , 0 ) | 0
  ( 0 , 1 ) | 1
  ( 1 , 1 ) | 2
  ( 2 , 1 ) | 3
  ( 1 , 2 ) | 4
  ( 3 , 1 ) | 5
  ( 3 , 2 ) | 6

where x marks the start point of a path segment, the numbers are the values of the chain code for the segment that
ends at the point.
In following example, the observed data with 11 data points are mapped into the reference data with 9 data points

The chain code that represents the path is
  (2 2 2 1 2 0 2 2 0 2 0)
See Fundamentals of Speech Recognition by Lawrence Rabiner and Biing-Hwang Juang, Prentice Hall, 1993.
The function takes the following arguments:
dist The distance of the optimal path.
path The optimal path.
lpath The length of the optimal path.
dobs The observed data array.
lobs The length of the observed data array.
sobs The scaling factor of the observed data array, where actual_data = input_data * 2**(-scaling_factor).
state Pointer to the internal state structure.
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
