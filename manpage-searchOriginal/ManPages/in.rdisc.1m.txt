in.rdisc remains part of the software distribution of the Solaris Operating Environment. It is, however, not used by
default. in.routed(1M) includes the functionality provided by in.rdisc. See routeadm(1M) for details of how to
specify the IPV4 routing daemon.
in.rdisc implements the ICMP router discovery protocol. The first form of the command is used on hosts and the
second form is used on routers.
in.rdisc can be invoked in either the first form (host mode) or second form (router mode).
On a host, in.rdisc populates the network routing tables with default routes. On a router, advertises the router to all
the hosts.
in.rdisc is managed by the service management facility (SMF), by means of the service identifier:
 svc:/network/routing/rdisc:default
On a host, in.rdisc listens on the ALL_HOSTS (224.0.0.1) multicast address for ROUTER_ADVERTISE mes<hy>
sages from routers. The received messages are handled by first ignoring those listed router addresses with which the
host does not share a network. Among the remaining addresses, the ones with the highest preference are selected as
default routers and a default route is entered in the kernel routing table for each one of them.
Optionally, in.rdisc can avoid waiting for routers to announce themselves by sending out a few ROUTER_SOLIC<hy>
ITATION messages to the ALL_ROUTERS (224.0.0.2) multicast address when it is started.
A timer is associated with each router address. The address will no longer be considered for inclusion in the routing
tables if the timer expires before a new advertise message is received from the router. The address will also be ex<hy>
cluded from consideration if the host receives an advertise message with the preference being maximally negative or
with a lifetime of zero.
When in.rdisc is started on a router, it uses the SIOCGIFCONF ioctl(2) to find the interfaces configured into the
system and it starts listening on the ALL_ROUTERS multicast address on all the interfaces that support multicast.
It sends out advertise messages to the ALL_HOSTS multicast address advertising all its IP addresses. A few initial
advertise messages are sent out during the first 30 seconds and after that it will transmit advertise messages approxi<hy>
mately every 600 seconds.
When in.rdisc receives a solicitation message, it sends an advertise message to the host that sent the solicitation
message.
When in.rdisc is terminated by a signal, it sends out an advertise message with the preference being maximally neg<hy>
ative.
Supported options and equivalent SMF service properties are listed below. SMF service properties are set using a
command of the form:
 # routeadm -m rdisc:default key=value
-a Accept all routers independent of the preference they have in their advertise messages. Normally, in.rdisc only
accepts (and enters in the kernel routing tables) the router or routers with the highest preference. Use of this option is
equivalent to setting the accept_all property to true.
-f Run in.rdisc forever even if no routers are found. Normally, in.rdisc gives up if it has not received any advertise
message after soliciting three times, in which case it exits with a non-zero exit code. If -f is not specified in the first
form then -s must be specified. For SMF execution, this option is required.
<beginning of page>
-r Act as a router, rather than a host. Use of this option is equivalent to setting the act_as_router property to true.
-s Send three solicitation messages initially to quickly discover the routers when the system is booted. When -s is
specified, in.rdisc exits with a non-zero exit code if it can not find any routers. This can be overridden with the -f op<hy>
tion. This option is not compatible with SMF execution and is not supported for the rdisc service.
-p preference Set the preference transmitted in the solicitation messages. The default is zero. Use of this option is
equivalent to setting the preference property.
-T interval Set the interval between transmitting the advertise messages. The default time is 600 seconds. Use of this
option is equivalent to setting the transmit_interval property.
The send-address and receive-address daemon options can be set by means of the send_address and receive_ad<hy>
dress properties.
