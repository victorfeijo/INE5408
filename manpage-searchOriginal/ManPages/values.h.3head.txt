This file contains a set of manifest constants, conditionally defined for particular processor architectures.
The model assumed for integers is binary representation (one's or two's complement), where the sign is represented
by the value of the high-order bit.
BITS(type) The number of bits in a specified type (for example, int).
HIBITS The value of a short integer with only the high-order bit set.
HIBITL The value of a long integer with only the high-order bit set.
HIBITI The value of a regular integer with only the high-order bit set.
MAXSHORT The maximum value of a signed short integer.
MAXLONG The maximum value of a signed long integer.
MAXINT The maximum value of a signed regular integer.
MAXFLOAT, LN_MAXFLOAT The maximum value of a single-precision floating-point number, and its natural
logarithm.
MAXDOUBLE, LN_MAXDOUBLE The maximum value of a double-precision floating-point number, and its nat<hy>
ural logarithm.
MINFLOAT, LN_MINFLOAT The minimum positive value of a single-precision floating-point number, and its
natural logarithm.
MINDOUBLE, LN_MINDOUBLE The minimum positive value of a double-precision floating-point number, and
its natural logarithm.
FSIGNIF The number of significant bits in the mantissa of a single-precision floating-point number.
DSIGNIF The number of significant bits in the mantissa of a double-precision floating-point number.
