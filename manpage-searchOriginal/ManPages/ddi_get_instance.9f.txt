int ddi_get_instance(dev_info_t *dip);
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
dip Pointer to dev_info structure.
The ddi_get_instance() function returns the instance number of the device corresponding to dip.
The system assigns an instance number to every device. Instance numbers for devices attached to the same driver
are unique. This provides a way for the system and the driver to uniquely identify one or more devices of the same
type. The instance number is derived by the system from different properties for different device types in an imple<hy>
mentation specific manner.
Once an instance number has been assigned to a device, it will remain the same even across reconfigurations and re<hy>
boots. Therefore, instance numbers seen by a driver may not appear to be in consecutive order. For example, if de<hy>
vice foo0 has been assigned an instance number of 0 and device foo1 has been assigned an instance number of 1, if
foo0 is removed, foo1 will continue to be associated with instance number 1 (even though foo1 is now the only de<hy>
vice of its type on the system).
The ddi_get_instance() function returns the instance number of the device corresponding to dip.
The ddi_get_instance() function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context.
