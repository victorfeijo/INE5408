dad <-> driver for IDE disk devices
dad@ target,lun:partition
This driver handles the ide disk drives on SPARC platforms. The type of disk drive is determined using the ATA IDE
identify device command and by reading the volume label stored on the drive. The dad device driver supports the
Solaris SPARC VTOC and the EFI/GPT disk volume labels.
The block-files access the disk using the system's normal buffering mechanism and are read and written without re<hy>
gard to physical disk records. There is also a "raw" interface that provides for direct transmission between the disk
and the user's read or write buffer. A single read or write call usually results in one I/O operation; raw I/O is there<hy>
fore considerably more efficient when many bytes are transmitted. The names of the block files are found in
/dev/dsk. Raw file names are found in /dev/rdsk.
I/O requests to the raw device must be aligned on a 512-byte (DEV_BSIZE) boundary and must have a length that
is a multiple of 512 bytes. Requests that do not meet the restrictions cause the driver to return an EINVAL error. I/O
requests to the block device have no alignment or length restrictions.
Each device maintains I/O statistics both for the device and for each partition allocated on that device. For each de<hy>
vice/partition, the driver accumulates reads, writes, bytes read, and bytes written. The driver also takes hi-resolution
time stamps at queue entry and exit points, which facilitates monitoring the residence time and cumulative resi<hy>
dence-length product for each queue.
Each device also has error statistics associated with it. These must include counters for hard errors, soft errors and
transport errors. Other data may be implemented as required.

where:
cn controller n
tn IDE target id n (0-3)
dn Always 0.
sn partition n (0-7)
The target ide numbers are assigned as:
0 Master disk on Primary channel.
1 Slave disk on Primary channel.
2 Master disk on Secondary channel
3 Slave disk on Secondary channel.
Refer to dkio(7I).

EBUSY The partition was opened exclusively by another thread.
EFAULT Argument was a bad address.
EINVAL Invalid argument.
EIO
 I/O error occurred.
ENOTTY The device does not support the requested ioctl function.
ENXIO The device did not exist during opening.
EROFS The device is a read-only device.

X3T10 ATA-4 specifications.
Command:<number>, Error:<number>, Status:<number>
Indicates that the command failed with an error and provides status register contents. Where <number> is a hexadec<hy>
imal value.
offline
The driver has decided that the target disk is no longer there.
disk ok
The target disk is now responding again.
disk not responding to selection
The target disk is not responding.
i/o to invalid geometry
The geometry of the drive could not be established.
incomplete read/write - retrying/giving up
There was a residue after the command completed normally.
no bp for disk label
A bp with consistent memory could not be allocated.
no memory for disk label
Free memory pool exhausted.
ATA transport failed: reason 'nnnn': {retrying|giving}
The host adapter has failed to transport a command to the target for the reason stated. The driver will either retry the
<beginning of page>
command or, ultimately, give up.
no mem for property
Free memory pool exhausted.
transport rejected (<n>)
Host adapter driver was unable to accept a command.
Device Fault
Device fault - reason for such error is vendor specific.
