symorder <-> rearrange a list of symbols
symorder [-s] objectfile symbolfile
symorder was used in SunOS 4.x specifically to cut down on the overhead of getting symbols from vmunix. This is
no longer applicable as kernel symbol entries are dynamically obtained through /dev/ksyms.
This script is provided as a convenience for software developers who need to maintain scripts that are portable
across a variety of operating systems.
symorder has exit status 0.
