lckpwdf, ulckpwdf <-> manipulate shadow password database lock file
#include <shadow.h>
int lckpwdf(void);
int ulckpwdf(void);
The lckpwdf() and ulckpwdf() functions enable modification access to the password databases through the lock file.
A process first uses lckpwdf() to lock the lock file, thereby gaining exclusive rights to modify the /etc/passwd or
/etc/shadow password database. See passwd(4) and shadow(4). Upon completing modifications, a process should
release the lock on the lock file using ulckpwdf(). This mechanism prevents simultaneous modification of the pass<hy>
word databases. The lock file, /etc/.pwd.lock, is used to coordinate modification access to the password databases
/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow.
If lckpwdf() is successful in locking the file within 15 seconds, it returns 0. If unsuccessful (for example,
/etc/.pwd.lock is already locked), it returns <mi>1.
If ulckpwdf() is successful in unlocking the file /etc/.pwd.lock, it returns 0. If unsuccessful (for example,
/etc/.pwd.lock is already unlocked), it returns <mi>1.
These routines are for internal use only; compatibility is not guaranteed.
