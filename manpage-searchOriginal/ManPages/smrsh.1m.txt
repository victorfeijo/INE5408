smrsh <-> restricted shell for sendmail
smrsh -c command
The smrsh program is intended as a replacement for the sh command in the prog mailer in sendmail(1M) configu<hy>
ration files. The smrsh program sharply limits commands that can be run using the |program syntax of sendmail.
This improves overall system security. smrsh limits the set of programs that a programmer can execute, even if
sendmail runs a program without going through an alias or forward file.
Briefly, smrsh limits programs to be in the directory /var/adm/sm.bin, allowing system administrators to choose the
set of acceptable commands. It also rejects any commands with the characters: ,, <, >, |, ;, &, $, \r (RETURN), or \n
(NEWLINE) on the command line to prevent end run attacks.
Initial pathnames on programs are stripped, so forwarding to /usr/ucb/vacation, /usr/bin/vacation, /home/serv<hy>
er/mydir/bin/vacation, and vacation all actually forward to/var/adm/sm.bin/vacation.
System administrators should be conservative about populating /var/adm/sm.bin. Reasonable additions are utilities
such as vacation(1) and procmail. Never include any shell or shell-like program (for example, perl) in the sm.bin
directory. This does not restrict the use of shell or perl scrips in the sm.bin directory (using the #! syntax); it simply
disallows the execution of arbitrary programs.
The following options are supported:
-c command Where command is a valid command, executes command.
/var/adm/sm.bin directory for restricted programs
