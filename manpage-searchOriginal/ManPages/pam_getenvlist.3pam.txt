char **pam_getenvlist(pam_handle_t *pamh);
The pam_getenvlist() function returns a list of all the PAM environment variables stored in the PAM handle pamh.
The list is returned as a null-terminated array of pointers to strings. Each string contains a single PAM environment
variable of the form name=value. The list returned is a duplicate copy of all the environment variables stored in
pamh. It is the responsibility of the calling application to free the memory returned by pam_getenvlist().
If successful, pam_getenvlist() returns in a null-terminated array a copy of all the PAM environment variables
stored in pamh. Otherwise, pam_getenvlist() returns a null pointer.

handle.
