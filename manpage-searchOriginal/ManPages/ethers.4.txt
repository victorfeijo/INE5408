ethers <-> Ethernet address to hostname database or domain
The ethers file is a local source of information about the (48-bit) Ethernet addresses of hosts on the Internet. The
ethers file can be used in conjunction with or instead of other ethers sources, including the NIS maps ethers.by<hy>
name and ethers.byaddr, the NIS+ table ethers, or Ethernet address data stored on an LDAP server. Programs use
the ethers(3SOCKET) routines to access this information.
The ethers file has one line for each host on an Ethernet. The line has the following format:
Ethernet-address official-host-name
Items are separated by any number of SPACE and/or TAB characters. A `#' indicates the beginning of a comment
extending to the end of line.
The standard form for Ethernet addresses is "x:x:x:x:x:x" where x is a hexadecimal number between 0 and ff, repre<hy>
senting one byte. The address bytes are always in network order. Host names may contain any printable character
other than SPACE, TAB, NEWLINE, or comment character.
