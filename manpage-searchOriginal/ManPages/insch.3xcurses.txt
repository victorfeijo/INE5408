int insch(chtype ch);
int mvinsch(int y, int x, chtype ch);
int mvwinsch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, chtype ch);
int winsch(WINDOW *win, chtype ch);
ch Is the character to be inserted.
y Is the y (row) coordinate of the position of the character.
x Is the x (column) coordinate of the position of the character.
win Is a pointer to the window in which the character is to be inserted.
These functions insert the character and rendition from ch into the current or specified window at the current or
specified position.
These functions do not perform wrapping and do not advance the cursor position. These functions perform special-
character processing, with the exception that if a newline is inserted into the last line of a window and scrolling is
not enabled, the behavior is unspecified.
Upon successful completion, these functions return OK. Otherwise, they return ERR.
No errors are defined.
These functions are only guaranteed to operate reliably on character sets in which each character fits into a single
byte, whose attributes can be expressed using only constants with the A_ prefix.
