showrev <-> show machine, software revision, and patch revision information
/usr/bin/showrev [-a] [-p | -p -R root_path] [-w]
 [-c command] [-s hostname]
showrev displays revision information for the current hardware and software. With no arguments, showrev shows
the system revision information including hostname, hostid, release, kernel architecture, application architecture,
hardware provider, domain, and kernel version.
If a command is supplied with the -c option, showrev shows the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH and finds out all
the directories within the PATH that contain it. For each file found, its file type, revision, permissions, library infor<hy>
mation, and checksum are printed as well.
The following options are supported:
-a Print all system revision information available. Window system and patch information are added.
-c command Print the revision information about command.
-p Print only the revision information about patches.
-R root_path Define the full path name of a directory to use as the root_path. By specifying the root path, showrev
retrieves the revision information about the patch from package system information files located under a directory
tree starting at root_path. The root_path can be specified when retrieving installed patch information in a client from
a server, for example, /export/root/client1. Note -
The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced with the -R option. Doing so might damage the
global zone's file system, might compromise the security of the global zone, and might damage the non-global
zone's file system. See zones(5).
-s hostname Perform this operation on the specified hostname. The -s operation completes correctly only when host<hy>
name is running Solaris 2.5 or compatible versions.
-w Print only the OpenWindows revision information.
Varies, based on flags passed. If no flags are passed, output similar to the following appears:
  Hostname: system1
  Hostid: 7233808e
  Release: 5.10
  Kernel architecture: sun4u
  Application architecture: sparc
  Hardware provider: Sun_Microsystems
  Domain: a.network.COM
  Kernel version: SunOS 5.10 generic

For the -s option to work when hostname is running a version of Solaris prior to 2.5, the Solstice AdminSuite must
be installed on hostname.
