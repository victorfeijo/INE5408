space <-> disk space requirement file
space is an ASCII file that gives information about disk space requirements for the target environment. The space
file defines space needed beyond what is used by objects defined in the prototype(4) file; for example, files which
will be installed with the installf(1M) command. The space file should define the maximum amount of additional
space that a package will require.
The generic format of a line in this file is:
pathname blocks inodes
Definitions for the fields are as follows:
pathname Specify a directory name which may or may not be the mount point for a filesystem. Names that do not
begin with a slash ('/') indicate relocatable directories.
blocks Define the number of disk blocks required for installation of the files and directory entries contained in the
pathname (using a 512-byte block size).
inodes Define the number of inodes required for installation of the files and directory entries contained in the path<hy>
name.
Example 1 A sample file.
 # extra space required by config data which is
 # dynamically loaded onto the system
 data 500 1
installf(1M), prototype(4)
