iser <-> iSCSI Extensions for Remote DMA driver
The iSER driver accelerates the iSCSI protocol by mapping the data transfer phases to Remote DMA (RDMA) oper<hy>
ations. No iSER configuration is required for its use, but an RDMA-capable protocol (RCaP) must be configured and
enabled on both target and initiator endpoints.
Currently, InfiniBand RC is the supported RCaP, and for discovery IP over IB must be configured on both the initia<hy>
tor and target. If Infiniband (IB) hardware is present and an Infiniband reliable-connected (RC) connection can be es<hy>
tablished then an iSER-enabled initiator uses iSER connections to iSER-enabled targets. Otherwise the connection is
established using IP-based connectivity.
