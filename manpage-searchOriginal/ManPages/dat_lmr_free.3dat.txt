 dat_lmr_free (

 )
lmr_handle: Handle for an instance of LMR to be destroyed.
The dat_lmr_free() function destroys an instance of the LMR. The LMR cannot be destroyed if it is in use by an
RMR. The operation does not deallocate the memory region or unpin memory on a host.
Use of the handle of the destroyed LMR in any subsequent operation except for dat_lmr_free() fails. Any DTO op<hy>
eration that uses the destroyed LMR after the dat_lmr_free() is completed shall fail and report a protection viola<hy>
tion. The use of rmr_context of the destroyed LMR by a remote peer for an RDMA DTO results in an error and bro<hy>
ken connection on which it was used. Any remote RDMA operation that uses the destroyed LMR rmr_context,
whose Transport-specific request arrived to the local host after the dat_lmr_free() has completed, fails and reports a
protection violation. Remote RDMA operation that uses the destroyed LMR rmr_context, whose Transport-specific
request arrived to the local host prior to the dat_lmr_free() returns, might or might not complete successfully. If it
fails, DAT_DTO_ERR_REMOTE_ACCESS is reported in DAT_DTO_COMPLETION_STATUS for the remote
RDMA DTO and the connection is broken.
DAT_SUCCESS The operation was successful.
DAT_INVALID_HANDLE The lmr_handle parameter is invalid.
DAT_INVALID_STATE Parameter in an invalid state; LMR is in use by an RMR instance.
