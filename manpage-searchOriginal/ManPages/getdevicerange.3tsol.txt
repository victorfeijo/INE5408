getdevicerange <-> get the label range of a device

#include <tsol/label.h>
blrange_t *getdevicerange(const char *device);
The getdevicerange() function returns the label range of a user-allocatable device.
If the label range is not specified for device, getdevicerange() returns the default values of ADMIN_LOW for the
lower bound and ADMIN_HIGH for the upper bound of device.
From the command line, list_devices(1) can be used to see the label range of device.
The getdevicerange() function returns NULL on failure and sets errno. On successful completion, it returns a point<hy>
er to a blrange_t structure which must be freed by the caller, as follows:
 blrange_t *range;
  ...
  m_label_free(range->lower_bound);
  m_label_free(range->upper_bound);
  free(range);
The getdevicerange() function will fail if:
EAGAIN There is not enough memory available to allocate the required bytes. The application could try later.
ENOMEM The physical limits of the system are exceeded by size bytes of memory which cannot be allocated.
ENOTSUP Invalid upper or lower bound for device.
