kid_t kstat_chain_update(kstat_ctl_t *kc);
The kstat_chain_update() function brings the user's kstat header chain in sync with that of the kernel. The kstat
chain is a linked list of kstat headers (kstat_t's) pointed to by kc->kc_chain, which is initialized by
kstat_open(3KSTAT). This chain constitutes a list of all kstats currently in the system.
During normal operation, the kernel creates new kstats and delete old ones as various device instances are added and
removed, thereby causing the user's copy of the kstat chain to become out of date. The kstat_chain_update() func<hy>
tion detects this condition by comparing the kernel's current kstat chain ID (KCID), which is incremented every time
the kstat chain changes, to the user's KCID, kc->kc_chain_id. If the KCIDs match, kstat_chain_update() does
nothing. Otherwise, it deletes any invalid kstat headers from the user's kstat chain, adds any new ones, and sets
kc->kc_chain_id to the new KCID. All other kstat headers in the user's kstat chain are unmodified.
Upon successful completion, kstat_chain_update() returns the new KCID if the kstat chain has changed and 0 if it
has not changed. Otherwise, it returns <mi>1 and sets errno to indicate the error.
The kstat_chain_update() function will fail if:
EAGAIN The kstat was temporarily unavailable for reading or writing.
ENOMEM Insufficient storage space is available.
ENXIO The given kstat could not be located for reading.
EOVERFLOW The data for the given kstat was too large to be stored in the structure.
