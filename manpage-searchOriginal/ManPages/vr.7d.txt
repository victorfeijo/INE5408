vr <-> driver for VIA Rhine fast Ethernet controllers
The vr Fast Ethernet driver is GLD based and supporting the VIA Rhine family of Fast Ethernet adapters:
 pci1106,3043 VIA VT86C100A Fast Ethernet
 pci1106,3065 VT6102 VIA Rhine II
 pci1106,3106 VT6105 VIA Rhine III
 pci1106,3053 VT6105 VIA Rhine III Management Adapter
The vr driver supports IEEE 802.3 auto-negotiation, flow control and VLAN tagging.
The default configuration is autonegotiation with bidirectional flow control. The advertised capabilities for autone<hy>
gotiation are based on the capabilities of the PHY.
You can set the capabilities advertised by the vr controlled device using dladm(1M). The driver supports a number
of parameters, the names of which begin with en_ (enabled). Each of these boolean parameters determines if the de<hy>
vice advertises that mode of operation when the hardware supports it.
The adv_autoneg_cap parameter controls whether auto-negotiation is performed. If adv_autoneg_cap is 0, the
driver selects the speed/duplex combination from the first non-zero parameter from this list:
 en_100fdx_cap 100Mpbs full duplex
 en_100hdx_cap 100Mpbs half duplex
 en_10fdx_cap 10Mpbs full duplex
 en_10hdx_cap 10Mpbs half duplex
All capabilities default to enabled. Changing any capability parameter causes the link to go down while the link part<hy>
ners renegotiate the link using the newly changed capabilities.
The vr driver does not support asymmetric flowcontrol. VT86C100A and Rhine II adapters are not capable of trans<hy>
mitting flowcontrol messages
