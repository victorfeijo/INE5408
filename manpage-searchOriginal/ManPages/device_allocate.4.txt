device_allocate <-> device_allocate file
/etc/security/device_allocate
The device_allocate file is an ASCII file that resides in the /etc/security directory. It contains mandatory access
control information about each physical device. Each device is represented by a one- line entry of the form:
device-name;device-type;reserved1;reserved2;auths;device-exec
where:
device-name
Represents an arbitrary ASCII string naming the physical device. This field contains no embedded white space or
non-printable characters.
device-type
Represents an arbitrary ASCII string naming the generic device type. This field identifies and groups together de<hy>
vices of like type. This field contains no embedded white space or non-printable characters. The following types of
devices are currently managed by the system: audio, sr (represents CDROM drives), fd (represents floppy drives), st
(represents tape drives), rmdisk (removable media devices).
reserved1
On systems configured with Trusted Extensions, this field stores a colon-separated (:) list of key-value pairs that de<hy>
scribe device allocation attributes used in Trusted Extensions. Zero or more keys can be specified. The following
keys are currently interpreted by Trusted Extensions systems:
minlabel
Specifies the minimum label at which device can be allocated. Default value is admin_low.
maxlabel
Specifies the maximum label at which device can be allocated. Default value is admin_high.
zone
Specifies the name of the zone in which device is currently allocated.
class
Specifies a logical grouping of devices. For example, all Sun Ray devices of all device types. There is no default
class.
xdpy
Specifies the X display name. This is used to identify devices associated with that X session. There is no default xd<hy>
py value.
reserved2
Represents a field reserved for future use.
auths
Represents a field that contains a comma-separated list of authorizations required to allocate the device, an asterisk
(*) to indicate that the device is not allocatable, or an '@' symbol to indicate that no explicit authorization is needed
to allocate the device. The default authorization is solaris.device.allocate. See auths(1).
<beginning of page>
device-exec
The physical device's data clean program to be run any time the device is acted on by allocate(1). This ensures that
unmanaged data does not remain in the physical device between uses. This field contains the filename of a program
in /etc/security/lib or the full pathname of a cleanup script provided by the system administrator.
The device_allocate file is an ASCII file that resides in the /etc/security directory.
Lines in device_allocate can end with a `\' to continue an entry on the next line.
Comments can also be included. A `#' makes a comment of all further text until the next NEWLINE not immediate<hy>
ly preceded by a `\'.
White space is allowed in any field.
The device_allocate file must be created by the system administrator before device allocation is enabled.
The device_allocate file is owned by root, with a group of sys, and a mode of 0644. Example 1 Declaring an Allo<hy>
catable Device
Declare that physical device st0 is a type st. st is allocatable, and the script used to clean the device after running
deallocate(1) is named /etc/security/lib/st_clean.
 # scsi tape

  st;\
  reserved;\
  reserved;\
  solaris.device.allocate;\
  /etc/security/lib/st_clean
Example 2 Declaring an Allocatable Device with Authorizations
Declare that physical device fd0 is of type fd. fd is allocatable by users with the solaris.device.allocate authoriza<hy>
tion, and the script used to clean the device after running deallocate(1) is named /etc/security/lib/fd_clean.
 # floppy drive

  fd;\

  solaris.device.allocate;\

Making a device allocatable means that you need to allocate and deallocate it to use it (with allocate(1) and deallo<hy>
cate(1)). If a device is not allocatable, there is an asterisk (*) in the auths field, and no one can use the device.

The functionality described in this man page is available only if Solaris Auditing has been enabled. See bsm<hy>
conv(1M) for more information.
On systems configured with Trusted Extensions, the functionality is enabled by default. On such systems, the de<hy>
vice_allocate file is updated automatically by the system.
