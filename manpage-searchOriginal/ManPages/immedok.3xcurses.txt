int immedok(WINDOW *win, bool bf);
If bf is TRUE, immedok() calls refresh(3XCURSES) if any change to the window image is made (for example,
through functions such as addch(3XCURSES), clrtobot(3XCURSES), and scrl(3XCURSES)). Repeated calls to
refresh() may affect performance negatively. The immedok () function is disabled by default.
win Is a pointer to the window that is to be refreshed.
bf Is a Boolean expression.
The immedok() function does not return a value.
None.
