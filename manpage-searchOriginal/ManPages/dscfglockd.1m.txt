dscfglockd <-> Availability Suite Services lock daemon
/usr/lib/dscfglockd [-e program | -f file]
The dscfglockd daemon coordinates StorageTek configuration database lock requests between nodes within a clus<hy>
ter.
The dscfglockd supports the following options:
-e program
Executes the script and arguments in program. The executable and any arguments it needs must be supplied with
suitable quoting as a single argument to this option. This argument is processed by sh(1).
-f file
Reads the list of names for peer hosts from file.
If no arguments are specified, dscfglockd acts as a local lock daemon, but coordinates lock requests with any other
daemons that might contact the local host as part of their own configuration process.
