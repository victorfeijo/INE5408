fbt <-> DTrace function boundary tracing provider
The fbt driver is a DTrace dynamic tracing provider that performs dynamic instrumentation at function boundaries
in the Solaris kernel.
The function is the fundamental unit of program text. In a well-designed system, the function performs a discrete
and well-defined operation on a specified object or series of like objects. Most functions are implemented by them<hy>
selves calling functions on encapsulated objects, but some functions <em>so-called "leaf functions" <em> are implement<hy>
ed without making further function calls. The Function Boundary Tracing fbt provider contains a mechanism for in<hy>
strumenting the vast majority of functions in the kernel and offering the instrumentation as a set of DTrace probes.
The fbt driver is not a public interface and you access the instrumentation offered by this provider through DTrace.
Refer to the Solaris Dynamic Tracing Guide for a description of the public documented interfaces available for the
DTrace facility and the probes offered by the fbt provider.
