scalb, scalbf, scalbl <-> load exponent of a radix-independent floating-point number
c99 [ flag... ] file... -lm [ library... ]
#include <math.h>
double scalb(double x, double n);
float scalbf(float x, float n);
long double scalbl(long double x, long double n);
These functions compute x * r^n, where r is the radix of the machine's floating point arithmetic. When r is 2, scalb()
is equivalent to ldexp(3M). The value of r is FLT_RADIX which is defined in <float.h>.
Upon successful completion, the scalb() function returns x * r^n.
If x or n is NaN, a NaN is returned.
If n is 0, x is returned.
If x is <+->Inf and n is not <mi>Inf, x is returned.
If x is <+->0 and n is not +Inf, x is returned.
If x is <+->0 and n is +Inf, a domain error occurs and a NaN is returned.
If x is <+->Inf and n is <mi>Inf, a domain error occurs and a NaN is returned.
If the result would cause an overflow, a range error occurs and <+->HUGE_VAL (according to the sign of x) is re<hy>
turned.
For exceptional cases, matherr(3M) tabulates the values to be returned by scalb() as specified by SVID3 and XPG3.
See standards(5).
These functions will fail if:
Domain Error If x is 0 and n is +Inf, or x is Inf and n is <mi>Inf.
If the integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the invalid floating-point
exception is raised.
Range Error The result would overflow.
If the integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the overflow floating-
point exception is raised.
An application wanting to check for exceptions should call feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these
functions. On return, if fetestexcept(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDER<hy>
FLOW) is non-zero, an exception has been raised. An application should either examine the return value or check
the floating point exception flags to detect exceptions.
