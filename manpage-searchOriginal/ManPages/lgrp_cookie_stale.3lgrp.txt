int lgrp_cookie_stale(lgrp_cookie_t cookie);
The lgrp_cookie_stale() function takes a cookie representing the snapshot of the lgroup hierarchy obtained from
lgrp_init(3LGRP) and returns whether it is stale. The snapshot can become out-of-date for a number of reasons de<hy>
pending on its view. If the snapshot was taken with LGRP_VIEW_OS, changes in the lgroup hierarchy from dy<hy>
namic reconfiguration, CPU on/offline, or other conditions can cause the snapshot to become out-of-date. A snap<hy>
shot taken with LGRP_VIEW_CALLER can be affected by the caller's processor set binding and changes in its
processor set itself, as well as changes in the lgroup hierarchy.
If the snapshot needs to be updated, lgrp_fini(3LGRP) should be called with the old cookie and lgrp_init() should
be called to obtain a new snapshot.
Upon successful completion, lgrp_cookie_stale() returns whether the cookie is stale. Otherwise, it returns <mi>1 and
sets errno to indicate the error.
The lgrp_cookie_stale() function will fail if:
EINVAL The cookie is not valid.
