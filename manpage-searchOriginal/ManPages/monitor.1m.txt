The CPU board of a workstation contains one or more EPROMs or EEPROMs. The program which executes from
the PROMs is referred to as "the monitor". Among other things, the monitor performs system initialization at
power-on and provides a user interface.
The monitor of earlier workstations was known as the SunMON monitor and displayed the > for its prompt. See the
SunMON MONITOR USAGE section for further details.
Existing workstations use a monitor which is known as the OpenBoot monitor. The OpenBoot monitor typically dis<hy>
plays ok as its prompt, but it may also display the > prompt under certain circumstances.
If the 'auto-boot?' NVRAM parameter is set to 'false' when the workstation is powered on, the system does not at<hy>
tempt to boot and the monitor issues its prompt. If 'auto-boot' is set to 'true', the system initiates the boot se<hy>
quence. The boot sequence can be aborted by simultaneously pressing two keys on the system's keyboard: L1 and A
(on older keyboards), or Stop and A (on newer keyboards). Either a lower case a or an upper case A works for the
keyboard abort sequence. If a console has been attached by way of one of the system's serial ports then the abort se<hy>
quence can be accomplished by sending a BREAK. See tip(1).
When the NVRAM 'security-mode' parameter has been turned on, or when the value of the 'sunmon-compat?'
parameter is true, then the OpenBoot monitor displays the message: Type b (boot), c (continue), or n (new com<hy>
mand mode)
and the > prompt appears.
Some of the more useful commands that can be issued from OpenBoot's ok prompt are described here. Refer to the
book for a complete list of commands.
Help for various functional areas of the OpenBoot monitor can be obtained by typing help. The help listing provides
a number of other key words which can then be used in the help command to provide further details.
Each workstation contains one or more NVRAM devices which contains unique system ID information, as well as a
set of user-configurable parameters. The NVRAM parameters allow the user a certain level of flexibility in config<hy>
uring the system to act in a given manner under a specific set of circumstances.
See eeprom(1M) for a description of the parameters and information regarding setting the parameters from the OS
level.
The following commands can be used at the OpenBoot monitor to access the NVRAM parameters.
printenv Used to list the NVRAM parameters, along with their default values and current values.
setenv pn pv Used to set or modify a parameter. The pn represents the parameter name, and pv represents the pa<hy>
rameter value.
set-default pn Used to set an individual parameter back to its default value.
set-defaults Used to reset all parameters to their default values. (Note that 'set-defaults' only affects parameters
that have assigned default values.)
Newer OpenBoot monitors contain user interfaces that support the storage and listing of keys for later use by client
programs.
<beginning of page>
list-security-keys
Lists the names of keys currently stored on a machine.
set-security-key keyname [ keydata ]
Stores key data keydata in a key named keyname. Actual key data can be up to 32 bytes in length. The maximum
length of keyname is 64 bytes, which allows for the hex-formatted ASCII used to present the key data. If keydata is
not present, keyname and its corresponding data is deleted.
The following commands are available for testing or checking the system's hardware. If the 'diag-switch?'
NVRAM parameter is set to true when the system is powered on, then a Power-On Self Test (POST) diagnostic is
run, if present, sending its results messages to the system's serial port A. Not all of the commands shown are avail<hy>
able on all workstations.
test-all Run the diagnostic tests on each device which has provided a self-test.
test floppy Run diagnostics on the system's floppy device.
test /memory Run the main memory tests. If the NVRAM parameter 'diag-switch?' is set to true, then all of main
memory is tested. If the parameter is false then only the amount of memory specified in the 'selftest-#megs'
NVRAM parameter is tested.
test net Test the network connection for the on-board network controller.
watch-net Monitor the network attached to the on-board net controller.
watch-net-all Monitor the network attached to the on-board net controller, as well as the network controllers in<hy>
stalled in SBus slots.
watch-clock Test the system's clock function.
The following commands are available for displaying information about the system. Not all commands are available
on all workstations.
banner Display the power-on banner.
.enet-addr Display the system's Ethernet address.
.idprom Display the formatted contents of the IDPROM.
module-info Display information about the system's processor(s).
probe-scsi Identify the devices attached to the on-board SCSI controller.
probe-scsi-all Identify the devices attached to the on-board SCSI controller as well as those devices which are at<hy>
tached to SBus SCSI controllers.
show-disks Display a list of the device paths for installed SCSI disk controllers.
<beginning of page>
show-displays Display a list of the device paths for installed display devices.
show-nets Display a list of the device paths for installed Ethernet controllers.
show-sbus Display list of installed SBus devices.
show-tapes Display a list of the device paths for installed SCSI tape controllers.
show-ttys Display a list of the device paths for tty devices.
.traps Display a list of the SPARC trap types.
.version Display the version and date of the OpenBoot PROM.
These commands must be typed from the keyboard, they do not work from a console which is attached by way of
the serial ports. With the exception of the Stop-A command, these commands are issued by pressing and holding
down the indicated keys on the keyboard immediately after the system has been powered on. The keys must be held
down until the monitor has checked their status. The Stop-A command can be issued at any time after the console
display begins, and the keys do not need to be held down once they've been pressed. The Stop-D, Stop-F and Stop-
N commands are not allowed when one of the security modes has been set. Not all commands are available on all
workstations.
Stop (L1) Bypass the Power-On Self Test (POST). This is only effective if the system has been placed into the diag<hy>
nostic mode.
Stop-A (L1-A) Abort the current operation and return to the monitor's default prompt.
Stop-D (L1-D) Set the system's 'diag-switch?' NVRAM parameter to 'true', which places the system in diagnos<hy>
tic mode. POST diagnostics, if present, are run, and the messages are displayed by way of the system's serial port
A.
Stop-F (L1-F) Enter the OpenBoot monitor before the monitor has probed the system for devices. Issue the 'fexit'
command to continue with system initialization.
Stop-N (L1-N) Causes the NVRAM parameters to be reset to their default values. Note that not all parameters have
default values.
The following commands can be used while the monitor is displaying the ok prompt. Not all of these editing com<hy>
mands are available on all workstations.
CTRL-A Place the cursor at the start of line.
CTRL-B Move the cursor backward one character.
ESC-B Move the cursor backward one word.
CTRL-D Erase the character that the cursor is currently highlighting.
ESC-D Erase the portion of word from the cursor's present position to the end of the word.
<beginning of page>
CTRL-E Place the cursor at the end of line.
CTRL-F Move the cursor forward one character.
ESC-F Move the cursor forward one word.
CTRL-H Erase the character preceding the cursor (also use Delete or Back Space)
ESC-H Erase the portion of the word which precedes the cursor (use also CTRL-W)
CTRL-K Erase from the cursor's present position to the end of the line.
CTRL-L Show the command history list.
CTRL-N Recall the next command from the command history list
CTRL-P Recall a previous command from the command history list.
CTRL-Q Quote the next character (used to type a control character).
CTRL-R Retype the current line.
CTRL-U Erase from the cursor's present position to the beginning of the line.
CTRL-Y Insert the contents of the memory buffer into the line, in front (to the left) of the cursor.
The nvramrc is an area of the system's NVRAM where users may store Forth programs. The programs which are
stored in the nvramrc are executed each time the system is reset, provided that the 'use-nvramrc?' NVRAM pa<hy>
rameter has been set to 'true'. Refer to the book for information on how to edit and use the nvramrc.
The command 'old-mode' is used to move OpenBoot into a restricted monitor mode, causing the > prompt to be
displayed. Only three commands are allowed while in the restricted monitor; the 'go' command (to resume a pro<hy>
gram which was interrupted with the Stop-A command), the 'n' command (to return to the normal OpenBoot moni<hy>
tor), and boot commands. The restricted monitor's boot commands approximate the older SunMON monitor's boot
command syntax. If a 'security-mode' has been turned on then the restricted monitor becomes the default monitor
environment. The restricted monitor may also become the default environment if the 'sunmon-compat?' NVRAM
parameter is set to true. Not all workstations have the 'sunmon-compat?' parameter.
The following commands are available systems with older SunMON-based PROM:
+|<mi>
Increment or decrement the current address and display the contents of the new location.
^C source destination n
(caret-C) Copy, byte-by-byte, a block of length n from the source address to the destination address.
^I program
(caret-I) Display the compilation date and location of program.
<beginning of page>
^T virtual_address
(caret-T) Display the physical address to which virtual_address is mapped.
b [ ! ] [ device [ (c,u,p) ] ] [ pathname ] [ arguments_list ]
b[?]
Reset appropriate parts of the system and bootstrap a program. A `!' (preceding the device argument) prevents the
system reset from occurring. Programs can be loaded from various devices (such as a disk, tape, or Ethernet). `b'
with no arguments causes a default boot, either from a disk, or from an Ethernet controller. `b?' displays all boot de<hy>
vices and their devices.

countered. <bu> A user program dropped into the monitor (by calling abortent). <bu> The user manually entered the moni<hy>
tor by typing L1<mi>A or BREAK. The display consists of the following: <bu> The special registers: PSR, PC, nPC,
TBR, WIM, and Y <bu> Eight global registers <bu> 24 window registers (8 in, 8 local, and 8 out), corresponding to one of
the 7 available windows. If a Floating-Point Unit is on board, its status register along with 32 floating-point registers
are also shown.
window_number Display the indicated window_number, which can be any value between 0 and 6, inclusive. If no
window is specified and the PSR's current window pointer contains a valid window number, registers from the win<hy>
dow that was active just prior to entry into the monitor are displayed. Otherwise, registers from window 0 are dis<hy>
played.
e [virtual_address][action] ...
Open the 16-bit word at virtual_address (default zero). The address is interpreted in the address space defined by
the s command. See the a command for a description of action.
f virtual_address1 virtual_address2 pattern [size]
Fill the bytes, words, or long words from virtual_address1 (lower) to virtual_address2 (higher) with the constant,
pattern. The size argument can take one of the following values:
b byte format (the default)
w word format
l long word format
For example, the following command fills the address block from 0x1000 to 0x2000 with the word pattern,
0xABCD:
f 1000 2000 ABCD W
g [vector] [argument]
g [virtual_address] [argument]
Goto (jump to) a predetermined or default routine (first form), or to a user-specified routine (second form). The val<hy>
ue of argument is passed to the routine. If the vector or virtual_address argument is omitted, the value in the PC is
used as the address to jump to.
To set up a predetermined routine to jump to, a user program must, prior to executing the monitor's g command, set
the variable *romp->v_vector_cmd to be equal to the virtual address of the desired routine. Predetermined routines
need not necessarily return control to the monitor.
The default routine, defined by the monitor, prints the user-supplied vector according to the format supplied in argu<hy>
ment. This format can be one of:
%x hexadecimal
%d decimal
