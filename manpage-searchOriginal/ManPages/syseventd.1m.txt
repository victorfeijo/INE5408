syseventd <-> kernel system event notification daemon
/usr/lib/sysevent/syseventd [-d debug_level] [-r rootdir]
syseventd is a user-level daemon that accepts delivery of system event buffers from the kernel. Once an event buffer
has been delivered to syseventd, it, in turn, attempts to propagate the event to all interested end event subscribers.
Event subscribers take the form of a syseventd loadable module (SLM). syseventd passes the event buffer to each
of its subscribers and in return expects a notification as to the successful or unsuccessful delivery attempt.
Upon successful delivery of the event buffer to all interested event subscribers, syseventd frees the event buffer from
the kernel event queue.
The following options are supported:
-d debug_level Enable debug mode. Messages are printed to the invoking user's terminal.
-r rootdir Cause syseventd to use an alternate root path when creating its door and lock files. Modules continue to
be loaded from the standard module directories.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
non-zero An error occurred.
