sccs-rmdel, rmdel <-> remove a delta from an SCCS file
rmdel -rsid s.filename...
The rmdel utility removes the delta specified by the SCCS delta ID (SID) supplied with -r. The delta to be removed
must be the most recent (leaf) delta in its branch. In addition, the SID must not be that of a version checked out for
editing: it must not appear in any entry of the version lock file (p.file).
If you created the delta, or, if you own the file and directory and have write permission, you can remove it with
rmdel.
If a directory name is used in place of the s.filename argument, the rmdel command applies to all s.files in that di<hy>
rectory. Unreadable s.files produce an error; processing continues with the next file (if any). The use of `<mi>' as the
s.filename argument indicates that the names of files are to be read from the standard input, one s.file per line.
The following option is supported:
-rsid Remove the version corresponding to the indicated SID (delta).
See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of rmdel: LANG,
LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.
p.file permissions file
s.file history file
z.file temporary copy of the s.file
