qlc <-> ISP2200, ISP2300, and SP212 Family Fibre Channel host bus adapter driver.
SUNW,qlc
The qlc host bus adapter driver is a Sun Fibre Channel transport layer-compliant nexus driver for the Qlogic
ISP2200, ISP2200A, ISP2310, ISP2312, and SP212 adapters. These adapters support Fibre Channel SCSI and IP
Protocols, FC-AL public loop profile, point-to-point fabric connection and Fibre Channel service classes two and
three (see NOTES section below).
The qlc driver interfaces with the Sun Fibre Channel transport layer to support the standard functions provided by
the SCSA interface. It supports auto request sense and tagged queueing by default. The driver requires that all de<hy>
vices have unique hard addresses in private loop configurations. Devices with conflicting hard addresses are not ac<hy>
cessible.

 SP-212-based host bus adapters (including QLA-210) are supported on x86 platforms only and are limited to a
maximum of 8 targets in fabric and sixteen targets in local loop topology. FL topology is not supported with the
SP-212-based host bus adapter.
