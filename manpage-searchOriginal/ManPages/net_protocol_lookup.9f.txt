net_protocol_lookup <-> locate an implementation of a network layer protocol
#include <sys/neti.h>
net_data_t net_protocol_lookup(netid_t id, const char *protocol);
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
id network instance identifier.
family name of the network protocol to find.
The net_protocol_lookup() function attempts to locate a data structure that defines what capabilities it is exporting
through this interface. The value returned by this call is guaranteed to be valid until it is passed into a call to
net_protocol_release(9F), after which it should no longer be treated as valid.
The protocol must be a registered name of a network protocol that has been registered. The symbols NHF_INET
and NHF_INET6 should be passed to net_protocol_lookup() as the protocol name to gain access to either IPv4 or
IPv6 respectively.
The net_protocol_lookup() function returns NULL if it does not find any knowledge about the network protocol
referenced. Otherwise, it returns a value that can be used with other calls in this framework.
The net_protocol_lookup() function may be called from user, kernel, or interrupt context.
