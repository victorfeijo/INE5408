ntxn <-> NetXen 10/1 Gigabit Ethernet network driver
/dev/ntxn*
The ntxn 10/1 Gigabit Ethernet driver is a multi-threaded, loadable, clonable, GLD-based STREAMS driver sup<hy>
porting the Data Link Provider Interface, dlpi(7P), on NetXen 10/1 Gigabit Ethernet controllers.
The ntxn driver functions include chip initialization, frames transmit and receive, promiscuous and multicast sup<hy>
port, TCP and UDP checksum off-load (IPv4) and 9600 bytes jumbo frame.
The ntxn driver and hardware support the 10GBASE CX4, 10GBASE-SR/W, LR/W, and 10/100/1000BASE-T
physical layers.
The cloning character-special device, /dev/ntxn, is used to access all NetXen devices installed within the system.
The ntxn driver is managed by the dladm(1M) command line utility, which allows VLANs to be defined on top of
ntxn instances and for ntxn instances to be aggregated. See dladm(1M) for more details.
The values returned by the driver in the DL_INFO_ACK primitive in response to your DL_INFO_REQ are: <bu> Maxi<hy>
mum SDU is 9600. <bu> Minimum SDU is 0. <bu> DLSAP address length is 8. <bu> MAC type is DL_ETHER. <bu> SAP (Ser<hy>
vice Access Point) length value is -2, meaning the physical address component is followed immediately by a 2-byte
SAP component within the DLSAP address. <bu> Broadcast address value is the Ethernet/IEEE broadcast address
(FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF).
By default, the ntxn driver works without any configuration file.
