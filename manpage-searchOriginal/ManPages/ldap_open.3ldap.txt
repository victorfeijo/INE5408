LDAP *ldap_open(const char *host, int port);
LDAP *ldap_init(const char *host, int port);
The ldap_open() function initializes an LDAP session and also opens a connection to an LDAP server before it re<hy>
turns to the caller. Unlike ldap_open(), ldap_init() does not open a connection to the LDAP server until an opera<hy>
tion, such as a search request, is performed.
The ldap_open() function is deprecated and should no longer be used. Call ldap_init() instead.
A list of LDAP hostnames or an IPv4 or IPv6 address can be specified with the ldap_open() and ldap_init() func<hy>
tions. The hostname can include a port number, separated from the hostname by a colon (:). A port number included
as part of the hostname takes precedence over the port parameter. The ldap_open() and ldap_init() functions at<hy>
tempt connections with LDAP hosts in the order listed and return the first successful connection.
These functions support the following parameters.
host The hostname, IPv4 or IPv6 address of the host that runs the LDAP server. A space-separated list of hostnames
can also be used for this parameter.
port TCP port number of a connection. Supply the constant LDAP_PORT to obtain the default LDAP port of 389.
If a host includes a port number, the default parameter is ignored.
The ldap_open() and ldap_init() functions return a handle to an LDAP session that contains a pointer to an opaque
structure. The structure must be passed to subsequent calls for the session. If a session cannot be initialized, the
functions return NULL and errno should be set appropriately.
Various aspects of this opaque structure can be read or written to control the session-wide parameters. Use the
ldap_get_option(3LDAP) to access the current option values and the ldap_set_option(3LDAP) to set values for
these options. Example 1 Specifying IPv4 and IPv6 Addresses
LDAP sessions can be initialized with hostnames, IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, such as those shown in the following ex<hy>
amples.
 ldap_init("hosta:636 hostb", 389)
 ldap_init("192.168.82.110:389", 389)
 ldap_init("[fec0::114:a00:20ff:ab3d:83ed]", 389)
