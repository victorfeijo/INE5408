The XTSOLsetPolyInstInfo() function sets the polyinstantiated information to get property resources. By default,
when a client requests property data for a polyinstantiated property, the data returned corresponds to the SL and UID
of the requesting client. To get the property data associated with a property with specific sl and uid, a client can use
this call to set the SL and UID with enabled flag to TRUE. The client should also restore the enabled flag to FALSE
after retrieving the property value. Client must have the PRIV_WIN_MAC_WRITE and
PRIV_WIN_DAC_WRITE privileges.
None.
BadAccess Lack of privilege.
BadValue Not a valid display or sl.
