The mlib_VideoColorSplit3_S16() function performs color channel split.
The elements of the colors array are selected in consecutive groups of three. As each group is processed, the first ele<hy>
ment is stored in the color1 array; the second element, in the color2 array; and the third element, in the color3 array.
This process is repeated untill the end of the colors array is reached.
The function takes the following arguments:
color1 Pointer to first color component row. color1 must be 8-byte aligned.
color2 Pointer to second color component row. color2 must be 8-byte aligned.
colors Pointer to colors multi-component row. colors must be 8-byte aligned.
n Length of color1, color2, and color3 arrays. Length of colors must be 3*n.
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
