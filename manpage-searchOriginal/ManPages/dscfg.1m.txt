The dscfg command controls the Availability Suite configuration by providing facilities to initialize, list, format, re<hy>
store the configuration database.
If no options are specified, dscfg displays the current local configuration location. The dscfg command supports the
following options:
-L
Displays the status of the lock controlling access to the configuration database. If the configuration database is
locked, the type of lock (read or write) is displayed along with the process id of the process that holds the lock.
-h
Displays the usage message for the dscfg command.
-i
Initializes the configuration database. As it deletes previous or current configuration information, this option
prompts you to confirm the deletion before proceeding.
-p parser_config_file
When used with the -i option, dscfg loads the parser configuration file into the persistent configuration, it reformats
the configuration database.
-a config_file
Restore the specified config_file into the configuration. This option does not do any error checking of the file. Use of
this option invalidates the configuration file.
-l
Lists the contents of current configuration database in a format that is suitable for the -a option. When used in com<hy>
bination with the -s option, it displays the contents stored in the location passed to the -s option, but does not set the
configuration location.
The options below are for Sun Cluster-configured systems only. group can be either Sun Cluster device group or as
'-' as local devices.
-C group
Display the location of cluster configuration database.

-C group -i
Initializes the configuration database entries that only associated with group specified. As it deletes previous or cur<hy>
rent configuration information, this options prompts you to confirm the deletion before proceeding.
-C group -p parser_config_file
When used with the -i option, dscfg loads the parser configuration file into the persistent configuration, it reformats
the configuration database entries that only associated with group specified.
-C  group -a config_file
Restore the specified config_file into the configuration database entries that only associated with group specified.
This option does not do any error checking of the file. Use of this option invalidates the configuration file.
-C group -l
Lists the contents of current configuration database that is associated with resource group specified.
-C  group -s config_file_location
Specifies where the Sun Cluster configuration database resides, the location has to be DID device.
-D device_group
Checks whether the specified device_group is known by Sun Cluster and whether it is available on this node. It dis<hy>
plays a information that indicates the device group's status and return values are as follows,
(use echo $? to retrieve the return value):
1 Device group is in Sun Cluster and is active on this node;
0 Device group is in Sun Cluster but active on another node;
-1 Device group is not in Sun Cluster.
The dscfg command is typically run from other scripts, such as package installation scripts, and from dscf<hy>
gadm(1M). It is not intended for general use. For uses of dscfg not covered by dscfgadm, please refer to the Avail<hy>
ability Suite Troubleshooting Guide.
