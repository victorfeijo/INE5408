rquotad <-> remote quota server
/usr/lib/nfs/rquotad
rquotad is an rpc(4) server which returns quotas for a user of a local file system which is mounted by a remote ma<hy>
chine over the NFS. The results are used by quota(1M) to display user quotas for remote file systems. The rquotad
daemon is normally invoked by inetd(1M).
See largefile(5) for the description of the behavior of rquotad when encountering files greater than or equal to 2
Gbyte (2^31 bytes).

The rquotad service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/network/nfs/rquota
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). Responsibility for initiating and restarting this service is delegated to inetd(1M). Use inetadm(1M) to
make configuration changes and to view configuration information for this service. The service's status can be
queried using the svcs(1) command.
If it is disabled, it will be enabled by mount_nfs(1M), share_nfs(1M), and automountd(1M) unless its applica<hy>
tion/auto_enable property is set to false.
