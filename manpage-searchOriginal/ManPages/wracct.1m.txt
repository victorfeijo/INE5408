wracct <-> write extended accounting records for active processes and tasks
/usr/sbin/wracct -i id_list [-t record_type]
 {process | task}
The wracct utility allows the administrator to invoke the extended accounting system, if active, to write intermediate
records representing the resource usage of a selected set of processes or tasks. For tasks, a record_type option is also
supported, allowing the administrator to request the writing of: <bu> an interval record, which reflects task usage since a
previous interval record (or since task creation if there is no interval record), or <bu> a partial record, which reflects us<hy>
age since task creation.
The following options are supported:
-i id_list Select the IDs of the tasks or processes to write records for. Specify id_list as a comma- or space-separated
list of IDs, presented as a single argument. For some shells, this requires appropriate quoting of the argument.
-t record_type Select type of record to write for the selected task or process. For tasks, record_type can be partial or
interval. partial is the default type, and the only type available for process records.
The following operands are supported:
process Treat the given ID as a process ID for the purposes of constructing and writing an extended accounting
record.
task Treat the given ID as a task ID for the purposes of constructing and writing an extended accounting record.
Example 1 Writing a Partial Record
Write a partial record for all active sendmail processes.
 # /usr/sbin/wracct -i "`pgrep sendmail`" process
Example 2 Writing an Interval Record
Write an interval record for the task with ID 182.
 # /usr/sbin/wracct -t interval -i 182 task
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
1 An error occurred.
2 Invalid command line options were specified.
3 Pertinent components of extended accounting facility are not active.
/var/adm/exacct/task
/var/adm/exacct/proc Extended accounting data files.
