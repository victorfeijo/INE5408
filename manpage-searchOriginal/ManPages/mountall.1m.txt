mountall is used to mount file systems specified in a file system table. The file system table must be in vfstab(4)
format. If no file_system_table is specified, /etc/vfstab is used. If <mi> is specified as file_system_table, mountall reads
the file system table from the standard input. mountall mounts only those file systems with the mount at boot field
set to yes in the file_system_table.
For each file system in the file system table, the following logic is executed: if there exists a
file/usr/lib/fs/FSType/fsckall, where FSType is the type of the file system, save that file system in a list to be passed
later, and all at once, as arguments to the /usr/lib/fs/FSType/fsckall script. The /usr/lib/fs/FSType/fsckall script
checks all of the file systems in its argument list to determine whether they can be safely mounted. If no
/usr/lib/fs/FSType/fsckall script exists for the FSType of the file system, the file system is individually checked using
fsck(1M). If the file system does not appear mountable, it is fixed using fsck before the mount is attempted. File sys<hy>
tems with a <mi> entry in the fsckdev field are mounted without first being checked.
umountall causes all mounted file systems in the current zone except root, /usr, /var, /var/adm, /var/run, /proc,
and /dev/fd to be unmounted. If the FSType is specified, mountall and umountall limit their actions to the FSType
specified. There is no guarantee that umountall unmounts busy file systems, even if the -k option is specified.
The following options are supported:
-F Specify the FSType of the file system to be mounted or unmounted.
-h host Unmount all file systems listed in /etc/mnttab that are remote-mounted from host.
-k Use the fuser -k mount-point command. See the fuser(1M) for details. The -k option sends the SIGKILL signal
to each process using the file. As this option spawns kills for each process, the kill messages might not show up im<hy>
mediately. There is no guarantee that umountall unmounts busy file systems, even if the -k option is specified.
-l Limit the action to local file systems.
-n List the actions that would be performed for the specified options, but do not actually execute these actions. Re<hy>
peating the command without the -n option executes the listed actions, assuming that the /etc/mnttab file has not
changed in the interval prior to repeating the command.
-r Limit the action to remote file system types.
-s Do not perform the umount operation in parallel.
-Z Apply the action(s) only to the file systems mounted in non-global zones. By default, umountall unmounts only
file systems mounted in the current zone. Option -Z is ignored if used in a non-global zone.

No messages are printed if the file systems are mountable and clean.
Error and warning messages come from fsck(1M) and mount(1M).
At this time, NFS is the only remote file system supported by the -l, -r, and -h options.
