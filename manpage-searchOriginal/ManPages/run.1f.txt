run <-> run an executable
run [-s] [-e] [-n] [-t string] program
The run command runs program, using the PATH variable to find it. By default, when program has completed, the
user is prompted (Press ENTER to continue:), before being returned to FMLI. The argument program is a system
executable followed by its options (if any).
The following options are supported:
-e If -e is specified, the user is prompted before returning to FMLI only if there is an error condition
-n If -n is specified, the user is never prompted before returning to FMLI (useful for programs like vi, in which the
user must do some specific action to exit in the first place).
-s The -s option means "silent", implying that the screen does not have to be repainted when program has completed.
The -s option should only be used when program does not write to the terminal. In addition, when -s is used, pro<hy>
gram cannot be interrupted, even if it recognizes interrupts.
-tstring If -t is specified, string is the name this process has in the pop-up menu generated by the frm-list command.
