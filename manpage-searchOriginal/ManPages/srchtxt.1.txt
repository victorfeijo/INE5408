srchtxt <-> display contents of, or search for a text string in, message data bases
srchtxt [-s] [-l locale] [-m msgfile ,...] [text]
The srchtxt utility is used to display all the text strings in message data bases, or to search for a text string in mes<hy>
sage data bases (see mkmsgs(1)). These data bases are files in the directory /usr/lib/locale/locale/LC_MESSAGES
(see setlocale(3C)), unless a file name given with the -m option contains a /. The directory locale can be viewed as
the name of the language in which the text strings are written. If the -l option is not specified, the files accessed will
be determined by the value of the environment variable LC_MESSAGES. If LC_MESSAGES is not set, the files
accessed will be determined by the value of the environment variable LANG. If LANG is not set, the files accessed
will be in the directory /usr/lib/locale//C/LC_MESSAGES , which contains default strings.
If no text argument is present, then all the text strings in the files accessed will be displayed.
If the -s option is not specified, the displayed text is prefixed by message sequence numbers. The message sequence
numbers are enclosed in angle brackets: <msgfile:msgnum>.
msgfile name of the file where the displayed text occurred
msgnum sequence number in msgfile where the displayed text occurred
This display is in the format used by gettxt(1) and gettxt(3C).
-s Suppress printing of the message sequence numbers of the messages being displayed.
-l locale Access files in the directory /usr/lib/locale/locale/LC_MESSAGES. If -m msgfile is also supplied, lOCALE
is ignored for msgfiles containing a /.
-m msgfile Access files specified by one or more msgfiles. If msgfile contains a / character, then msgfile is interpreted
as a pathname; otherwise, it will be assumed to be in the directory determined as described above. To specify more
than one msgfile, separate the file names using commas.
text Search for the text string specified by text and display each one that matches. text can take the form of a regular
expression; see regexp(5).
Example 1 Using srchtxt
If message files have been installed in a locale named french by using mkmsgs(1), then you could display the entire
set of text strings in the french locale (/usr/lib/locale/french/LC_MESSAGES/* ) by typing:
 example% srchtxt <mi>l french
Example 2 Using srchtxt
If a set of error messages associated with the operating system have been installed in the file UX in the french locale
(/usr/lib/locale/french/LC_MESSAGE/UX ), then, using the value of the LANG environment variable to deter<hy>
mine the locale to be searched, you could search that file in that locale for all error messages dealing with files by
typing:
 example% setenv LANG=french; export LANG
 example% srchtxt -m UX "[Ff]ichier"
If /usr/lib/locale/french/LC_MESSAGES/UX contained the following strings:
 Erreur E/S\n
<beginning of page>
 Liste d'arguments trop longue\n
 Fichier inexistant\n
 Argument invalide\n
 Trop de fichiers ouverts\n
 Fichier trop long\n
 Trop de liens\n
 Argument hors du domaine\n
 Identificateur supprim\n
 Etreinte fatale\n
  .
  .
  .
then the following strings would be displayed:
 <UX:3>Fichier inexistant\n
 <UX:5>Trop de fichiers ouverts\n
 <UX:6>Fichier trop long\n
Example 3 Using srchtxt
If a set of error messages associated with the operating system have been installed in the file UX and a set of error
messages associated with the INGRESS data base product have been installed in the file ingress, both in the german
locale, then you could search for the pattern [Dd]atei in both the files UX and ingress in the german locale by typ<hy>
ing:
 example% srchtxt -l german -m UX,ingress "[Dd]atei"
See environ(5) for a description of the LC_CTYPE environment variable that affects the execution of srchtxt.

The error messages produced by srchtxt are intended to be self-explanatory. They indicate an error in the command
line or errors encountered while searching for a particular locale and/or message file.
