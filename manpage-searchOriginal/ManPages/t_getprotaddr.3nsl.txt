int t_getprotaddr(int fd, struct t_bind *boundaddr,
 struct t_bind *peeraddr);
This routine is part of the XTI interfaces which evolved from the TLI interfaces. XTI represents the future evolution
of these interfaces. However, TLI interfaces are supported for compatibility. When using a TLI routine that has the
same name as an XTI routine, the tiuser.h header file must be used. Refer to the TLI COMPATIBILITY section
for a description of differences between the two interfaces.
The t_getprotaddr() function returns local and remote protocol addresses currently associated with the transport
endpoint specified by fd. In boundaddr and peeraddr the user specifies maxlen, which is the maximum size (in
bytes) of the address buffer, and buf which points to the buffer where the address is to be placed. On return, the buf
field of boundaddr points to the address, if any, currently bound to fd, and the len field specifies the length of the ad<hy>
dress. If the transport endpoint is in the T_UNBND state, zero is returned in the len field of boundaddr. The buf field
of peeraddr points to the address, if any, currently connected to fd, and the len field specifies the length of the ad<hy>
dress. If the transport endpoint is not in the T_DATAXFER, T_INREL, T_OUTCON or T_OUTREL states, zero
is returned in the len field of peeraddr. If the maxlen field of boundaddr or peeraddr is set to zero, no address is re<hy>
turned.
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned. Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and t_errno is set to in<hy>
dicate the error.
ALL - apart from T_UNINIT.
On failure, t_errno is set to one of the following:
TBADF The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.
TBUFOVFLW The number of bytes allocated for an incoming argument (maxlen) is greater than 0 but not suffi<hy>
cient to store the value of that argument.
TPROTO This error indicates that a communication problem has been detected between XTI and the transport
provider for which there is no other suitable XTI error (t_errno).
TSYSERR A system error has occurred during execution of this function.
In the TLI interface definition, no counterpart of this routine was defined.
