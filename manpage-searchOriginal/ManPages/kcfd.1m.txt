kcfd <-> kernel-level cryptographic framework daemon
kcfd
The kcfd daemon helps in managing CPU usage by cryptographic operations performed in software by kernel
threads. The system utilization associated with these threads is charged to the kcfd process. It also does module veri<hy>
fication for kernel cryptographic modules.
Only a privileged user can run this daemon.
The kcfd daemon is automatically invoked in run level 1, after /usr is mounted. A previously invoked kcfd daemon
that is still running must be stopped before invoking another kcfd command.
Manually starting and restarting kcfd is not recommended. If it is necessary to do so, use the cryptoadm(1M) start
and stop subcommands.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Daemon started successfully.
> 1 Daemon failed to start.
