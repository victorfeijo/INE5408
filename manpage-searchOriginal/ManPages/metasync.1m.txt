metasync <-> handle metadevice resync during reboot
/usr/sbin/metasync -h
/usr/sbin/metasync [-s setname] [buffer_size] metadevice
/usr/sbin/metasync [-s setname] -r [buffer_size]
/usr/sbin/metasync -p metadevice
/usr/sbin/metasync -c metadevice
The metasync command starts a resync operation on the specified metadevice. All components that need to be
resynced are resynced. If the system crashes during a RAID5 initialization, or during a RAID5 resync, either an ini<hy>
tialization or resync restarts when the system reboots.
Applications are free to access a metadevice at the same time that it is being resynced by metasync. Also, metasync
performs the copy operations from inside the kernel, which makes the utility more efficient.
Use the -r option in boot scripts to resync all possible submirrors.
The following options are supported:
-c metadevice Cancels the resync that is in progress on the specified metadevice. The resync will be stopped at its
current point and can be resumed by running the "metasync metadevice" command. This option only applies to
RAID1 volumes.
-h Displays usage message.
-p metadevice Regenerates parity information for RAID5 metadevices.
-s setname Specifies the name of the diskset on which metasync will work. Using the -s option will cause the com<hy>
mand to perform its administrative function within the specified diskset. Without this option, the command will per<hy>
form its function on local metadevices.
-r Specifies that the metasync command handle special resync requirements during a system reboot. metasync -r
should only be invoked from the svc:/system/mdmonitor service. The metasync command only resyncs those
metadevices that need to be resynced. metasync schedules all the mirror resyncs according to their pass numbers.
To override the default buffer_size value used by the svc:/system/mdmonitor service, you can edit /etc/system to
specify:
 set md_mirror:md_resync_bufsz = 2048
so that resyncs occur as quickly as possible.
buffer_size Specifies the size (number of 512-byte disk blocks) of the internal copy buffer for the mirror resync. The
size defaults to 1024 512-byte disk blocks. It can be no more than 2048 blocks. For best performance (quickest com<hy>
pletion of the resync), 2048 blocks is the recommended size.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred.

The metasync service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/system/mdmonitor
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). The service's status can be queried using the svcs(1) command.
