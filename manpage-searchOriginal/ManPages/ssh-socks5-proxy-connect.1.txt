ssh-socks5-proxy-connect <-> Secure Shell proxy for SOCKS5
/usr/lib/ssh/ssh-socks5-proxy-connect
 [-h socks5_proxy_host]
 [-p socks5_proxy_port] connect_host connect_port
A proxy command for ssh(1) that uses SOCKS5 (RFC 1928). Typical use is where connections external to a net<hy>
work are only allowed via a socks gateway server.
This proxy command does not provide any of the SOCKS5 authentication mechanisms defined in RFC 1928. Only
anonymous connections are possible.
The following options are supported:
-h socks5_proxy_host Specifies the proxy web server through which to connect. Overrides the SOCKS5_SERVER
environment variable.
-p socks5_proxy_port Specifies the port on which the proxy web server runs. If not specified, port 80 is assumed.
Overrides the SOCKS5_PORT environment variable.
The following operands are supported:
socks5_proxy_host The host name or IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the proxy.
socks5_proxy_port The numeric port number to connect to on socks5_proxy_host.
connect_host The name of the remote host to which the socks gateway is to connect you.
connect_port The numeric port number of the socks gateway to connect you to on connect_host.
The recommended way to use a proxy connection command is to configure the ProxyCommand in ssh_config(4)
(see Example 1 and Example 2). Example 3 shows how the proxy command can be specified on the command line
when running ssh(1). Example 1 Setting the proxy from the environment
The following example uses ssh-socks5-proxy-connect in ssh_config(4) when the proxy is set from the environ<hy>
ment:
 Host playtime.foo.com
  ProxyCommand /usr/lib/ssh/ssh-socks5-proxy-connect \
  playtime.foo.com 22
Example 2 Overriding proxy environment variables
The following example uses ssh-socks5-proxy-connect in ssh_config(4) to override (or if not set) proxy environ<hy>
ment variables:
 Host playtime.foo.com
  ProxyCommand /usr/lib/ssh/ssh-socks5-proxy-connect -h socks-gw \
  -p 1080 playtime.foo.com 22
Example 3 Using the command line
The following example uses ssh-socks5-proxy-connect from the ssh(1) command line:
 example$ ssh -o'ProxyCommand=/usr/lib/ssh/ssh-socks5-proxy-connect \
<beginning of page>
  -h socks-gw -p 1080 playtime.foo.com 22' playtime.foo.com
SOCKS5_SERVER Takes socks5_proxy_host operand to specify the default proxy host.
SOCKS5_PORT Takes socks5_proxy_port operand to specify the default proxy port.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
1 An error occurred.
