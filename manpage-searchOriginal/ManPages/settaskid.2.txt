The settaskid() function makes a request of the system to assign a new task ID to the calling process, changing the
associated project ID to that specified. The calling process must have sufficient privileges to perform this operation.
The flags argument should be either TASK_NORMAL for a regular task, or TASK_FINAL, which disallows sub<hy>
sequent settaskid() calls by the created task.
The gettaskid() function returns the task ID of the calling process.
The getprojid() function returns the project ID of the calling process.
Upon successful completion, these functions return the appropriate task or project ID. Otherwise, <mi>1 is returned and
errno is set to indicate the error.
The settaskid() function will fail if:
EACCES The invoking task was created with the TASK_FINAL flag.
EAGAIN A resource control limiting the number of tasks or LWPs in the current project or zone has been exceeded.
A resource control on the given project would be exceeded.
EINVAL The given project ID is not within the valid project ID range.
EPERM The {PRIV_PROC_TASKID} privilege is not asserted in the effective set of the calling process.
