impact Impact of error
The following service impact values are accepted by ddi_fm_service_impact():
DDI_SERVICE_LOST The service provided by the device is unavailable due to an error. The operational state of
the device will transition to DEVI_DEVICE_DOWN.
DDI_SERVICE_DEGRADED The driver is unable to provide normal service, but it can provide a partial or de<hy>
graded level of service. The driver might have to make repeated attempts to perform an operation before it succeeds,
or it may be running at less than its configured speed. A driver may use this value to indicate that an alternative de<hy>
vice should be used if available, but that it can continue operation if no alternative exists. The operational state of the
device will transition to DEVI_DEVICE_DEGRADED.
DDI_SERVICE_RESTORED The service provided by the device has been restored. The operational state of the
device will transition to its pre-error condition state and DEVI_DEVICE_DOWN or DEVI_DEVICE_DEGRAD<hy>
ED is removed.
DDI_SERVICE_UNAFFECTED The service provided by the device was unaffected by the error.
The ddi_fm_service_impact() function can be called from user, kernel, or high-level interrupt context.
