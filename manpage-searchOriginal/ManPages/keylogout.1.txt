keylogout <-> delete stored secret key with keyserv
/usr/bin/keylogout [-f]
keylogout deletes the key stored by the key server process keyserv(1M). Further access to the key is revoked; how<hy>
ever, current session keys might remain valid until they expire or are refreshed.
Deleting the keys stored by keyserv causes any background jobs or scheduled at(1) jobs that need secure RPC ser<hy>
vices to fail. Since only one copy of the key is kept on a machine, it is a bad idea to place a call to this command in
your .logout file since it affects other sessions on the same machine.
If multiple NIS+ authentication mechanisms are configured for the system, then all keys stored by the key server
process is deleted, including keys that are no longer configured.
The following options are supported:
-f Force keylogout to delete the secret key for the superuser. By default, keylogout by the superuser is disallowed
because it would break all RPC services, such as NFS, that are started by the superuser.

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
NIS+ to LDAP are available in the current Solaris release. For more information, visit http://www.sun.com/directo<hy>
