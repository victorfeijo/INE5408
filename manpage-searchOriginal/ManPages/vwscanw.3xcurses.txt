int vwscanw(WINDOW *win, char *fmt, va_list varglist);
fmt
 Is a scanf() format string.
varglist Is a pointer to a list of parameters.
win Is a pointer to the window in which the character is to be read.
The vwscanw() function achieves the same effect as wscanw(3XCURSES) using a variable argument list. The third
argument is a va_list, as defined in <varargs.h>.
Upon successful completion, vwscanw() returns OK. Otherwise, it returns ERR.
No errors are defined.
The vwscanw() function is deprecated; the vw_scanw(3XCURSES) function is preferred. The use of the vwscanw()
and vw_scanw() in the same file will not work, due to the requirements to include <varargs.h> and <stdarg.h>,
which both contain definitions of va_list.
