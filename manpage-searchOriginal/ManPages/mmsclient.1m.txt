mmsclient <-> send script commands to Media Management server
/usr/bin/mmsclient [-f filename] [-A application-name] [-c clientname]
 [-i instancename] [-n network_config_file] [-P password]
 [-p portnumber] [-s hostname:port] [-t tag]
/usr/bin/mmsclient -h
The mmsclient command creates a session with a Media Management (MM) server, enabling you to send Media
Management Protocol (MMP) commands to the server and receive responses from that server. When used with the -f
option (see below), mmsclient runs a script file that performs MMP operations. See mmsclient_script(4) for a de<hy>
scription of the script file.
The MMP and the commands in the script file are based, in part, on IEEE 1244, the Media Management System
(MMS) standards.
To run mmsclient, you must become superuser, or assume the Primary Administrator role.
The following options are supported:
-A application-name
Specifies the MMS application name to use for the current session. The default application name is MMS.
-c client-name
Specifies the MMS client from which commands are sent to the MMS server. The default is localhost. Note that this
is not the host name for the MMS, which you specify with the -s option (see below).
-f filename
Specifies the name of the file containing the MMP commands. See mmsclient_script(4) for a description of the
script file.
-h
Display usage information.
-i instance-name
Specifies the MMS application instance to use for this session. If administrative tasks such as creating or deleting
objects are planned for the session, specify the instance as Admin.
-n network_config_file
Defines the configuration for the application client that runs the script, including the default values. To run the script
of MMP commands, the application client can be configured explicitly, can use the default values, or can be modi<hy>
fied using the values in this XML file. See EXAMPLES.
-P password-file
Specifies the full path to a file containing the password for the application specified with the -A option. If the com<hy>
mand does not contain the -P option, you are prompted for the password. There is no default.
-p portnumber
Specify port number of MMS server.
-s hostname[:port]
Specifies the MMS server and, optionally, the port number, to which you send MMP commands. If you do not speci<hy>
fy port, the port number defaults to 7151.

-t tag
Specify a tag for identifying an MMS session. You can match against tag to query information related to a session.
The default tag is mmsclient-pid=pid, where pid is the PID of the MMS client.
Example 1 Example of a Network Configuration File
The following example configuration file, net_cfg.xml, specifies the conditions under which the MMP commands
are performed:
 <!-- Client Configuration -->
 <mms_cfg>
  <!-- Network Configuration -->
  <mms_network_cfg
  host = "localhost"
  port = "7151"
  name = "MMS"
  instance = "admin"
  language = "MMP"
  version = "1.0"
  password = "summer05"
  <!-- mm_password = "MMS Media Manager" -->
  ssl_enabled = "false"
  ssl_cert_file = "/var/mms/ssl/pub/mms.pem"
  ssl_pass_file = "/var/mms/ssl/pub/mms_pass"
  <!-- ssl_crl_file = "/var/mms/ssl/pub/mms_crl.pem" -->
  />
 </mms_cfg>
Example 2 Running a Script with Default Connections
The following command runs a script named test_beginend with the default connections:
 # mmsclient -f test_beginend
Example 3 Specifying a Client by Host Name and Port Number
The following command runs a script named test_beginend that connects to an MMS server on a host named x4200
and port number 1492 as the HSM admin:
 # mmsclient -f test_beginend -A HSM -i admin -t HSM_test_session \
 -s x4200:1492
Example 4 Using a Network Configuration File and Specifying an Interactive Session
The following command connects to the MMS server defined in the net_cfg.xml file and runs an interactive session:
 # mmsclient -n net_cfg.xml
0
Success.
