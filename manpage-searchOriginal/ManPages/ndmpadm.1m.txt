/usr/sbin/ndmpadm [-? ] subcommand [options] [direct-object]
The ndmpadm command can be used to query the ndmpd(1M) daemon to get the status of active sessions, termi<hy>
nate a session, query backup devices, and set or get the current NDMP (Network Data Management Protocol) ser<hy>
vice variables and properties. ndmpadm is implemented as a set of subcommands, many with their own direct ob<hy>
ject, which are described in the section for a given subcommand. Certain subcommands support options, which are
described along with the subcommand.
The ndmpadm command supports the following subcommands:
disable
Disable the specified authentication password handling.
enable
Enable the specified authentication password handling.
get
Get the value of an NDMP configuration property.
kill-sessions
Terminate an active session.
set
Set the value of an NDMP configuration property.
show-devices
Get a list of tape devices connected to the server.
show-sessions
Display the details of active NDMP sessions.
The following option is supported:
-? Display a list of all subcommands and options.
The ndmpadm command supports the subcommands described below.
The syntax for the disable subcommand is:
 # ndmpadm disable -a auth-type
This subcommand disables the authentication type specified by auth-type for an NDMP client's remote access. Valid
values for auth-type are cram-md5 or cleartext.
The syntax for the enable subcommand is:
 # ndmpadm enable -a auth-type -u username
<beginning of page>
This subcommand prompts for the user's password twice for confirmation and activates the specified authentication
type with the given username and password for NDMP client access. Valid values for auth-type are cram-md5 or
cleartext.
The syntax for the get subcommand is:
 # ndmpadm get [-p] [property] [[-p] property=value]...
The property names are the same as used for the set subcommand and are described below. If you do not specify a
property, the get subcommand returns all configuration properties.
The kill-sessions subcommand allows you to terminate the session number ID.
The syntax for the kill-sessions subcommand is:
 # ndmpadm kill-sessions ID
The syntax for the set subcommand is:
 # ndmpadm set [-p] property=value [[-p] property=value]...
The properties you can set with the set subcommand are described in the ndmp(4) man page.
The syntax for the show-devices subcommand is:
 # ndmpadm show-devices
This subcommand lists the name, vendor, serial number, and other information about the current tape drive and li<hy>
braries connected to the system.
The show-sessions subcommand displays details of a session. The syntax for the show-sessions subcommand is:
 # ndmpadm show-sessions [-i tape,scsi,data,mover] [ID]
The show-sessions subcommand supports the following arguments:
-i tape,scsi,data,mover
Identify a type of interface about which to obtain data. If no interface is specified, show-sessions displays informa<hy>
tion for all types of interfaces.
ID
Identifies a particular session about which to display data. If no ID is specified, show-sessions displays data for all
sessions.
Example 1 Obtaining the Status of All NDMP Connections
The following command obtains status on all connections.
 # ndmpadm show-devices
Example 2 Obtaining the Status of Certain Types of Connections
<beginning of page>
The following command obtains status on tape and SCSI interfaces.
 # ndmpadm show-sessions -i scsi,tape
Example 3 Limiting Protocol Version
The following command limits the use of the NDMP protocol to version 3.
 # ndmpadm set -p version=3
Example 4 Turning on Debugging
The following command enables debugging. It also sets the NDMP protocol to version 3.
 # ndmpadm set -p debug-level=1 -p version=3
Example 5 Obtaining Current Version Number
The following command obtains the version number of the currently running NDMP.
 # ndmpadm get -p version
Example 6 Disconnecting a Specific Session
The command shown below disconnects session 5. The session number was previously obtained from an ndmpadm
show-sessions command.
 # ndmpadm kill-session 5
Example 7 Obtaining the Values for All NDMP Properties
The following command obtains the values for all NDMP properties.
 # ndmpadm get
Example 8 Enabling CRAM-MD5 Authentication
The following command enables CRAM-MD5 authentication.
 # ndmpadm enable -a cram-md5 -u admin

The ndmpd(1M) daemon is managed by the service management facility (smf(5)), under the service identifier:
 svc:/system/ndmpd
Administrative actions on this service, such as setting and getting a property can be alternatively performed using
svccfg(1M). For example to enable Direct Access Recovery (DAR) mode:
 # svccfg -s svc:/system/ndmpd
 svc:/system/ndmpd> setprop ndmpd/dar-support = yes
...and to get the list of properties:
 # svccfg -s svc:/system/ndmpd
 svc:/system/ndmpd> listprop
