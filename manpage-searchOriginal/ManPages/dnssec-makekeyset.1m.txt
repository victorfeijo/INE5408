dnssec-makekeyset <-> DNSSEC zone signing tool
dnssec-makekeyset [-ahp] [-s start-time] [-e end-time]
 [-r randomdev] [-t ttl] [-v level] key...
The dnssec-makekeyset utility generates a key set from one or more keys created by dnssec-keygen(1M). It creates
a file containing a KEY record for each key, and self-signs the key set with each zone key. The output file is of the
form keyset-nnnn., where nnnn is the zone name.
-a Verify all generated signatures.
-e end-time Specify the date and time when the generated SIG records expire. As with start-time, an absolute time is
indicated in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS notation. A time relative to the start time is indicated with +N, which is N
seconds from the start time. A time relative to the current time is indicated with now+N. If no end-time is specified,
30 days from the start time is used as a default.
-h Print a short summary of the options and arguments to dnssec-makekeyset().
-p Use pseudo-random data when signing the zone. This is faster, but less secure, than using real random data. This
option may be useful when signing large zones or when the entropy source is limited.
-r randomdev Specify the source of randomness. If the operating system does not provide a /dev/random or equiv<hy>
alent device, the default source of randomness is keyboard input. The randomdev argument specifies the name of a
character device or file containing random data to be used instead of the default. The special value keyboard indi<hy>
cates that keyboard input should be used.
-s start-time Specify the date and time when the generated SIG records become valid. This can be either an absolute
or relative time. An absolute start time is indicated by a number in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS notation;
20000530144500 denotes 14:45:00 UTC on May 30th, 2000. A relative start time is indicated by +N, which is N
seconds from the current time. If no start-time is specified, the current time is used.
-t ttl Specify the TTL (time to live) of the KEY and SIG records. The default is 3600 seconds.
-v level Set the debugging level.
The following operands are supported:
key The list of keys to be included in the keyset file. These keys are expressed in the form Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii as gen<hy>
erated by dnssec-keygen.
Example 1 Generates a keyset containing the DSA key for example.com.
The following command generates a keyset containing the DSA key for example.com generated in the dnssec-key<hy>
gen(1M) manual page.
 dnssec-makekeyset -t 86400 -s 20000701120000 -e +2592000 \
 Kexample.com.+003+26160
In this example, dnssec-makekeyset() creates the file keyset-example.com. This file contains the specified key and
a self-generated signature.
The DNS administrator for example.com could send keyset-example.com. to the DNS administrator for .com for
signing, if the .com zone is DNSSEC-aware and the administrators of the two zones have some mechanism for au<hy>
thenticating each other and exchanging the keys and signatures securely.
