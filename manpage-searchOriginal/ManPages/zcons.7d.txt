zcons <-> Zone console device driver
The zcons character driver exports the console for system zones. The driver is comprised of two "sides:" a master
side with which applications in the global zone communicate, and a slave side, which receives I/O from the master
side. The slave side is available in the global zones.
Applications must not depend on the location of /dev or /devices entries exported by zcons. Inside a zone, the zcons
slave side is fronted by /dev/console and other console-related symbolic links, which are used by applications that
expect to write to the system console.
The zcons driver is Sun Private, and may change in future releases.
