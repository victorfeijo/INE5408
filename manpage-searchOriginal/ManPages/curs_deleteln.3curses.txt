With the deleteln() and wdeleteln() routines, the line under the cursor in the window is deleted; all lines below the
current line are moved up one line. The bottom line of the window is cleared. The cursor position does not change.
This does not imply use of a hardware delete line feature.
With the insdelln() and winsdelln() routines, for positive n, insert n lines into the specified window above the cur<hy>
rent line. The n bottom lines are lost. For negative n, delete n lines (starting with the one under the cursor), and move
the remaining lines up. The bottom n lines are cleared. The current cursor position remains the same.
With the insertln() and insertln() routines, a blank line is inserted above the current line and the bottom line is lost.
This does not imply use of a hardware insert line feature.
All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.

The header <curses.h> automatically includes the headers <stdio.h> and <unctrl.h>.
Note that all but winsdelln() may be macros.
