ftpaddhost <-> set up a virtual FTP host
ftpaddhost -c | -l [-b] [-x xferlog] hostname root_dir
The ftpaddhost script is executed by the super user to set up virtual FTP hosts. The ftpaddhost command config<hy>
ures the virtual host hostname under directory root_dir. The value of hostname can be an IP address or the name of a
host.
The ftpaddhost script supports the following options:
-b Create a banner for the virtual host. This option is useful to confirm that the virtual host is working.
-c Configure complete virtual hosting. This option allows each virtual host to have its own version of the ftpaccess,
ftpconversions, ftpgroups, ftphosts, and ftpusers files. The master version of each of these configuration files is
copied from the /etc/ftpd directory and placed in the /etc/ftpd/virtual-ftpd/hostname directory. If the /etc/ftpusers
file exists it is appended to the virtual ftpusers file. If a virtual host lacks its own version of a configuration file, the
master version is used.
-l Configure limited virtual hosting. This option allows a small number of parameters to be configured differently
for a virtual host. See the virtual keyword on the ftpaccess(4) manual page.
-x xferlog Create a logfile entry such that the transfer logs for the virtual host are written to the specified file. An ab<hy>
solute path must be specified for the xferlog file.
The following operands are supported:
hostname The host name or IP address of the virtual server.
root_dir The absolute pathname of the directory under which the virtual server is set up.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion
1 Improper usage of the command
2 Command failed
/etc/ftpd/virtual-ftpd/hostname
The configuration files directory for the virtual host hostname.
