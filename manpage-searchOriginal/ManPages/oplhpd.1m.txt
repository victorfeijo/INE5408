oplhpd <-> Hot plug daemon for SPARC Enterprise Server line
/usr/platform/SUNW,SPARC-Enterprise/lib/sparcv9/lib/oplhpd
The hot plug daemon for SPARC Enterprise Servers is a daemon process that runs on the SUNW,SPARC-Enter<hy>
prise family of servers. The daemon is started by the service management facility (see smf(5)) and communicates
with the service processor when hot plug PCI cassettes change their dynamic reconfiguration state.
The service FMRI for oplhpd is:
 svc:/platform/sun4u/oplhpd:default
A domain supports only one running oplhpd process at a time.
OPLHPD uses syslog(3C) to report status and error messages. All of the messages are logged with the LOG_DAE<hy>
MON facility.
Error messages are logged with the LOG_ERR and LOG_NOTICE priorities, and informational messages are
logged with the LOG_DEBUG priority. The default entries in the /etc/syslog.conf file log all of the OPLHPD error
messages to the /var/adm/messages log.
