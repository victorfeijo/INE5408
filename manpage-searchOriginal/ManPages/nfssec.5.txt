nfssec <-> overview of NFS security modes
The mount_nfs(1M) and share_nfs(1M) commands each provide a way to specify the security mode to be used on
an NFS file system through the sec=mode option. mode can be sys, dh, krb5, krb5i, krb5p, or none. These security
modes can also be added to the automount maps. Note that mount_nfs(1M) and automount(1M) do not support
sec=none at this time. mount_nfs(1M) allows you to specify a single security mode; share_nfs(1M) allows you to
specify multiple modes (or none). With multiple modes, an NFS client can choose any of the modes in the list.
The sec=mode option on the share_nfs(1M) command line establishes the security mode of NFS servers. If the NFS
connection uses the NFS Version 3 protocol, the NFS clients must query the server for the appropriate mode to use.
If the NFS connection uses the NFS Version 2 protocol, then the NFS client uses the default security mode, which is
currently sys. NFS clients may force the use of a specific security mode by specifying the sec=mode option on the
command line. However, if the file system on the server is not shared with that security mode, the client may be de<hy>
nied access.
If the NFS client wants to authenticate the NFS server using a particular (stronger) security mode, the client wants to
specify the security mode to be used, even if the connection uses the NFS Version 3 protocol. This guarantees that
an attacker masquerading as the server does not compromise the client.
The NFS security modes are described below. Of these, the krb5, krb5i, krb5p modes use the Kerberos V5 proto<hy>
col for authenticating and protecting the shared filesystems. Before these can be used, the system must be configured
to be part of a Kerberos realm. See kerberos(5).
sys Use AUTH_SYS authentication. The user's UNIX user-id and group-ids are passed in the clear on the network,
unauthenticated by the NFS server. This is the simplest security method and requires no additional administration. It
is the default used by Solaris NFS Version 2 clients and Solaris NFS servers.
dh Use a Diffie-Hellman public key system (AUTH_DES, which is referred to as AUTH_DH in the forthcoming
Internet RFC).
krb5 Use Kerberos V5 protocol to authenticate users before granting access to the shared filesystem.
krb5i Use Kerberos V5 authentication with integrity checking (checksums) to verify that the data has not been tam<hy>
pered with.
krb5p User Kerberos V5 authentication, integrity checksums, and privacy protection (encryption) on the shared
filesystem. This provides the most secure filesystem sharing, as all traffic is encrypted. It should be noted that perfor<hy>
mance might suffer on some systems when using krb5p, depending on the computational intensity of the encryption
algorithm and the amount of data being transferred.
none Use null authentication (AUTH_NONE). NFS clients using AUTH_NONE have no identity and are mapped
to the anonymous user nobody by NFS servers. A client using a security mode other than the one with which a So<hy>
laris NFS server shares the file system has its security mode mapped to AUTH_NONE. In this case, if the file sys<hy>
tem is shared with sec=none, users from the client are mapped to the anonymous user. The NFS security mode none
is supported by share_nfs(1M), but not by mount_nfs(1M) or automount(1M).
