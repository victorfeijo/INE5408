kdb5_ldap_util [-D user_dn [-w passwd]] [-H ldap_uri] command
 [command_options]
The kdb5_ldap_util utility allows an administrator to manage realms, Kerberos services, and ticket policies. The
utility offers a set of general options, described under OPTIONS, and a set of commands, which, in turn, have their
own options. Commands and their options are described in their own subsections, below.
kdb5_ldap_util has a small set of general options that apply to the kdb5_ldap_util utility itself and a larger number
of options that apply to specific commands. A number of these command-specific options apply to multiple com<hy>
mands and are described in their own section, below.
The following general options are supported:
-D user_dn
Specifies the distinguished name (DN) of a user who has sufficient rights to perform the operation on the LDAP
server.
-H ldap_uri
Specifies the URI of the LDAP server.
-w passwd
Specifies the password of user_dn. This option is not recommended.
The following options apply to a number of kdb5_ldap_util commands.
-subtrees subtree_dn_list
Specifies the list of subtrees containing the principals of a realm. The list contains the DNs of the subtree objects
separated by a colon.
-sscope search_scope
Specifies the scope for searching the principals under a subtree. The possible values are 1 or one (one level), 2 or
sub (subtrees).
-containerref container_reference_dn
Specifies the DN of the container object in which the principals of a realm will be created. If the container reference
is not configured for a realm, the principals will be created in the realm container.
-maxtktlife max_ticket_life
Specifies maximum ticket life for principals in this realm.
-maxrenewlife max_renewable_ticket_life
Specifies maximum renewable life of tickets for principals in this realm.
-r realm
Specifies the Kerberos realm of the database; by default the realm returned by krb5_default_local_realm(3) is
used.

A number of kdb5_ldap_util commands have ticket_flag options. These flags are described as follows:
{-|+}allow_dup_skey
-allow_dup_skey disables user-to-user authentication for principals by prohibiting principals from obtaining a ses<hy>
sion key for another user. This setting sets the KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_DUP_SKEY flag. +allow_dup_skey
clears this flag.
{-|+}allow_forwardable
-allow_forwardable prohibits principals from obtaining forwardable tickets. This setting sets the
KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_FORWARDABLE flag. +allow_forwardable clears this flag.
{-|+}allow_postdated
-allow_postdated prohibits principals from obtaining postdated tickets. This setting sets the KRB5_KDB_DISAL<hy>
LOW_POSTDATED flag. +allow_postdated clears this flag.
{-|+}allow_proxiable
-allow_proxiable prohibits principals from obtaining proxiable tickets. This setting sets the KRB5_KDB_DISAL<hy>
LOW_PROXIABLE flag. +allow_proxiable clears this flag.
{-|+}allow_renewable
-allow_renewable prohibits principals from obtaining renewable tickets. This setting sets the KRB5_KDB_DIS<hy>
ALLOW_RENEWABLE flag. +allow_renewable clears this flag.
{-|+}allow_svr
-allow_svr prohibits the issuance of service tickets for principals. This setting sets the KRB5_KDB_DISAL<hy>
LOW_SVR flag. +allow_svr clears this flag.
{-|+}allow_tgs_req
-allow_tgs_req specifies that a Ticket-Granting Service (TGS) request for a service ticket for principals is not per<hy>
mitted. This option is useless for most purposes. +allow_tgs_req clears this flag. The default is +allow_tgs_req. In
effect, -allow_tgs_req sets the KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_TGT_BASED flag on principals in the database.
<beginning of page>

is -needchange. In effect, +needchange sets the KRB5_KDB_REQUIRES_PWCHANGE flag on principals in
the database.
{-|+}password_changing_service
+password_changing_service sets a flag in the attributes field marking a principal as a password-change-service
principal (a designation that is most often not useful). -password_changing_service clears the flag. That this flag
has a long name is intentional. The default is -password_changing_service. In effect, +password_changing_ser<hy>
vice sets the KRB5_KDB_PWCHANGE_SERVICE flag on principals in the database.
{-|+}requires_hwauth
+requires_hwauth requires principals to preauthenticate using a hardware device before being allowed to kinit(1).
This setting sets the KRB5_KDB_REQUIRES_HW_AUTH flag. -requires_hwauth clears this flag.
{-|+}requires_preauth
