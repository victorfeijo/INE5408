OM_uint32 gss_release_cred(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
 gss_cred_id_t *cred_handle);
The gss_release_cred() function informs the GSS-API that the specified credential handle is no longer required by
the application and frees the associated resources. The cred_handle parameter is set to GSS_C_NO_CREDEN<hy>
TIAL when this call completes successfully.
The parameter descriptions for gss_release_cred() follow:
minor_status A mechanism specific status code.
cred_handle An opaque handle that identifies the credential to be released. If GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL is spec<hy>
ified, the gss_release_cred() function will complete successfully, but it will do nothing.
gss_release_cred() may return the following status codes:
GSS_S_COMPLETE Successful completion.
GSS_S_NO_CRED The referenced credentials cannot be accessed.
GSS_S_FAILURE The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific GSS status code is defined.
The mechanism-specific status code reported by means of the minor_status parameter details the error condition.
