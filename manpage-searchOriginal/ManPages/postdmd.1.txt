postdmd translates DMD bitmap files, as produced by dmdps, or files written in the Ninth Edition bitfile(9.5) format
into PostScript and writes the results on the standard output. If no files are specified, or if <mi> is one of the input files,
the standard input is read.
-b num Pack the bitmap in the output file using num byte patterns. A value of 0 turns off all packing of the output
file. By default, num is 6.
-c num Print num copies of each page. By default only one copy is printed.
-f Flip the sense of the bits in files before printing the bitmaps.
-m num Magnify each logical page by the factor num. Pages are scaled uniformly about the origin, which by default
is located at the center of each page. The default magnification is 1.0.
-n num Print num logical pages on each piece of paper, where num can be any positive integer. By default num is set
to 1.
-o list Print pages whose numbers are given in the comma-separated list. The list contains single numbers N and
ranges N1 <mi> N2. A missing N1 means the lowest numbered page, a missing N2 means the highest. The page range is
an expression of logical pages rather than physical sheets of paper. For example, if you are printing two logical
pages to a sheet, and you specified a range of 4, then two sheets of paper would print, containing four page layouts.
If you specified a page range of 3-4, when requesting two logical pages to a sheet; then only page 3 and page 4 lay<hy>
outs would print, and they would appear on one physical sheet of paper.
-p mode Print files in either portrait or landscape mode. Only the first character of mode is significant. The default
mode is portrait.
-x num Translate the origin num inches along the positive x axis. The default coordinate system has the origin fixed
at the center of the page, with positive x to the right and positive y up the page. Positive num moves everything right.
The default offset is 0 inches.
-y num Translate the origin num inches along the positive y axis. Positive num moves everything up the page. The
default offset is 0.
Only one bitmap is printed on each logical page, and each of the input files must contain complete descriptions of at
least one bitmap. Decreasing the pattern size using the -b option may help throughput on printers with fast proces<hy>
sors (such as PS-810s), while increasing the pattern size will often be the right move on older models (such as
PS-800s).
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
non-zero An error occurred.
