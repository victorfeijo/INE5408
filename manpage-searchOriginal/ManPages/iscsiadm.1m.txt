iscsiadm <-> enable management of iSCSI initiators
iscsiadm subcommand direct-object [options] [operand]
The iscsiadm command enables management of the iSCSI (Internet SCSI) initiator on a host. iscsiadm is imple<hy>
mented as a set of subcommands, many with their own options, which are described in the section for that subcom<hy>
mand. Options not associated with a particular subcommand are described under OPTIONS.
iscsiadm works only when the following service is online:
 svc:/network/iscsi/initiator:default
The iscsiadm command supports the following subcommands, which are described in detail in subsections that fol<hy>
low:
add Adds element(s) to an object.
list Lists element(s) of an object.
modify Modifies attributes of an object.
remove Removes an element from an object.
The iscsiadm subcommands operate on a direct-object. These are described in the section for each subcommand.
The iscsiadm command supports the Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) for the discovery of iSCSI targets. The
command supports the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) for authentication.
The syntax for the add subcommand is:
 # iscsiadm add direct_object [operands...]
The add subcommand adds the following direct_objects:
discovery-address discovery-address [...]
Adds a target to a list of discovery addresses. A discovery address (as in the syntax shown below) is an IP ad<hy>
dress:port combination used in a SendTargets discovery session. Using this discovery approach, a target device can
inform an initiator of the target address and target name of each target exposed by that device. Connection to a target
is not attempted unless the SendTargets method of discovery has been enabled on the host. You enable this method
with the modify subcommand.
The discovery-address parameter is formatted as:
 <IP address>[:port]
If port is not specified, the default of 3260 will be used.
isns-server isns-server [...]
Add an iSNS server to the list of iSNS server addresses. An iSNS server address (specified in the syntax shown be<hy>
low) is an IP address-port combination used in an iSNS discovery session. By using iSNS discovery, an iSNS server
can provide an initiator with information about a portal and the name of each target that belongs to the same discov<hy>
ery domain as that of the initiator. Connection to the iSNS server is not attempted unless the iSNS method of discov<hy>
ery has been enabled on the host. You enable this method with the modify subcommand, described below.
The isns-server parameter is formatted as:
 IP_address[:port]
<beginning of page>
If a port is not specified, the default of 3205 is used.
static-config static_target [...]
Adds a target to the list of statically configured targets. A connection to the target will not be attempted unless the
static configuration method of discovery has been enabled.
The static_target parameter is formatted as:
 <target-name>,<target address>[:port-number][,tpgt]
<target-name> can be up to 223 characters.
The syntax for the list subcommand is:
 # iscsiadm list direct-object [options]
The list subcommand displays data for the following direct-objects:
discovery
Lists the discovery methods and their current activation state, enabled or disabled. Discovery methods are: <bu> iSNS
(Internet Storage Name Service) <bu> Static <bu> SendTargets
initiator-node
Lists information for the initiator node on the host. The iSCSI initiator node represents a logical HBA and is a logi<hy>
cal host connection point for iSCSI targets. The parameter values listed in the response are default parameter settings
for the initiator. Each connected target for an initiator can have parameter values that differ from the parameter val<hy>
ues on the initiator node.
static-config [static_target[, ...]]
Lists the target name and address for specified targets or, if no static targets are specified, all statically discovered
targets.
target [-S] [-v] [target[, ...]]
Lists a target's current parameters, connection state, and which method was used for the target's discovery. Reports
information for specified targets or, if no targets are specified, all targets that have been discovered or have had pa<hy>
rameters modified by the modify target subcommand.
When used with the -S option for a specified target, this subcommand returns: <bu> target name <bu> logical unit number <bu>
vendor ID <bu> product ID <bu> OS device name (for example, /dev/rdsk/c0t2d0s0) The -v options gives more details, such
as the current login parameters, the detailed connection information, and the discovery method used to discover the
target.
A return of NA as the discovery method parameter indicates that the target was created with a iscsiadm modify tar<hy>
get-param command and does not exist as a discovered object. To remove such targets, use iscsiadm remove tar<hy>
get-param.
target-param [-v] target [...]
Lists a target's default and user-defined parameters.
discovery-address [-v] [discovery-address[, ...]]
Lists the discovery-address objects that have been added using the iscsiadm add discovery-address subcommand.
When used with the -v option, lists all known targets at a specified discovery-address. The -v option returns one or
<beginning of page>
more target names along with zero or more target addresses and associated target portal group tags (TPGT), if appli<hy>
cable.
isns-server [-v] [isns-server[, ...]]
Lists the isns-server objects that have been added using the iscsiadm add isns-server subcommand.
When used with the -v option, this subcommand lists all known targets at a specified isns-server address. The -v op<hy>
tion returns one of more target names along with zero or more target addresses and associated target portal group
tags, if applicable.
The syntax for the modify subcommand is:
 # iscsiadm modify direct_object [options]
The modify subcommand supports the following direct_objects:
discovery [options]
Enabling a discovery method initiates a discovery using that method. Disabling a discovery method that is currently
enabled does not affect connections to any targets that have already been discovered by that method.
Options for modify discovery are as follows:
-i, -iSNS enable | disable
Enable or disable iSNS discovery.
-s, --static enable | disable
Enable or disable static discovery.
-t, --sendtargets enable | disable
Enable or disable SendTargets discovery.
initiator-node [options]
Modifies an initiator's properties. If a target is currently connected, this operation can succeed. However, the modi<hy>
fied set of parameters will not be in effect for that target until an existing connection session no longer exists and a
new connection has been established. The options -C and --CHAP-secret require a CHAP secret entry in response
to a prompt.
For iSCSI booting when the Solaris I/O multipathing feature (formerly known as Sun StorEdge Traffic Manager
[STMS] or MPxIO) is disabled, you can modify only the following initiator-node options: <bu> -r, --radius-server <bu> -R,
--radius-access <bu> -P, --radius-shared-secret For iSCSI booting when the Solaris I/O multipathing feature is en<hy>
abled, you can modify only the following initiator-node options: <bu> -h, --headerdigest <bu> -d, --datadigest <bu> -c, --con<hy>
figured-sessions Options for modify initiator-node are as follows:
-A, --node-alias <initiator node alias>
Modifies the initiator node alias. Maximum length of 223 characters.
-a, --authentication chap | none
Sets the authentication mode.
-C, --CHAP-secret
Sets the CHAP secret value. There is no default value. Maximum length is 16 characters; minimum required length
is 12 characters.
<beginning of page>
-c, --configured-sessions <num_sessions> | <IP address>[,<IP address>...]
Sets the number of configured iSCSI sessions that will be created for each iSCSI target. The feature should be used
in combination with the Solaris I/O multipathing feature described in scsi_vhci(7D).
-d, --datadigest none | CRC32
Sets whether CRC32 is enabled to check SCSI data transfers.
-H, --CHAP-name CHAP name
Specifies a CHAP username. If you do not use this option, upon initialization, the CHAP name is set to the initiator
node name. When the authentication method is set to CHAP (see -a/--authentication option, above), the CHAP
username is displayed with the command iscsiadm list initiator-node.
-h, --headerdigest none | CRC32
Sets whether CRC32 is enabled to check SCSI packet headers.
-N, --node-name <initiator node name>
Modifies the initiator node name. Maximum of 223 characters. Note -
During Solaris installation, the initiator node name is set to a globally unique value. Changing this value can ad<hy>
versely affect operation within the iSCSI network.
-P, --radius-shared-secret (exclusive)
Sets the RADIUS shared secret.
-R, --radius-access enable | disable
Sets whether a RADIUS server will be used.
-r, --radius-server <IP address>[:<port>]
Sets the IP address and port of the radius server to be used.
-T, --tunable-param <<tunable-prop>=<value>, ...>
Specify one or more tunable parameters for all targets that initiator node connected. Note -
These values should only be modified by an administrator with a good working knowledge of the parameter's impact
within the iSCSI network. Supported tunable-prop options are:
recv-login-rsp-timeout
Session Login Response Time
The recv-login-rsp-timeout option specifies how long iSCSI initiator will wait for the response of iSCSI session lo<hy>
gin request from the iSCSI target. Valid value is from 0 to 60*60, default to 60 seconds.
conn-login-max
Maximized Connection Retry Time
The conn-login-max option lets the iSCSI initiator reestablish the connection to the target in case of IO timeout or
connection failure during the given time window. Valid value is from 0 to 60*60, default to 180 seconds.
<beginning of page>
polling-login-delay
Login Retry Time Interval
The polling-login-delay option specifies the time interval between each login retry when iSCSI initiator to target IO
timeout or connection failure. Valid value is from 0 to 60*60, default to 60 seconds.
target-param [options] target
Modifies a target's parameters. If a target is currently connected, the modify operation will succeed, although the
modified settings might not take effect for a few seconds. To confirm that these settings are active, use iscsiadm list
target -v. If a specified target is not associated with any discovery method, a target object is created with the speci<hy>
fied parameters. After using this command to modify a target's parameters, the new parameters will persist until they
are modified or removed with a iscsiadm remove target-param command on that target. The options -C and
--CHAP-secret require a CHAP secret entry in response to a prompt.
Options for modify target-param are as follows:
-B, --bi-directional-authentication enable | disable
Sets the bidirectional option. If set to enable, the initiator performs bidirectional authentication for the specified tar<hy>
get.
-C, --CHAP-secret
Sets the target's CHAP secret value. There is no default value. Maximum acceptable length is 16 characters.
-c, --configured-sessions <num_sessions> | <IP address>[,<IP address>...]
Sets the number of configured iSCSI sessions that will be created for each iSCSI target. The feature should be used
in combination with the Solaris I/O multipathing feature described in scsi_vhci(7D).
-d, --datadigest none | CRC32
Sets whether CRC32 is enabled or disabled for the data.
-H, --CHAP-name CHAP name
Sets a CHAP username. If you do not use this option, upon initialization, the CHAP name is set to the target name.
When the authentication method is set to CHAP (see -a/--authentication option, under the initiator-node direct ob<hy>
ject, above), the CHAP username is displayed with the command iscsiadm list initiator-node.
-h, --headerdigest none | CRC32
Sets whether CRC32 is enabled or disabled for the header.
-p, --login-param
Specify one or more login parameter settings. Note -
These values should only be modified by an administrator with a good working knowledge of the parameter's impact
within the iSCSI network. The login parameters are derived from iSCSI proposed standard RFC 3720. Valid values
are:
dataseqinorder yes or no
defaulttime2retain 0-3600
<beginning of page>
defaulttime2wait 0-3600
firstburstlength 512 to 2^24-1
immediatedata yes or no
initialr2t yes or no
maxburstlength 512 to 2^24-1
datapduinorder yes or no
maxoutstandingr2t 1 to 65535
maxrecvdataseglen 512 to 2^24-1
-T, --tunable-param <<tunable-prop>=<value>, ...>
Specify one or more tunable parameters for all targets that initiator node connected. Note -
Tunable values should only be modified by an administrator with a good working knowledge of the parameter's im<hy>
pact within the iSCSI network. Supported tunable-prop options are:
recv-login-rsp-timeout
Session Login Response Time
The recv-login-rsp-timeout option specifies how long iSCSI initiator will wait for the response of iSCSI session lo<hy>
gin request from the iSCSI target. Valid value is from 0 to 60*60, default to 60 seconds.
conn-login-max
Maximized Connection Retry Time
The conn-login-max option lets the iSCSI initiator reestablish the connection to the target in case of IO timeout or
connection failure during the given time window. Valid value is from 0 to 60*60, default to 180 seconds.
polling-login-delay
Login Retry Time Interval
The polling-login-delay option specifies the time interval between each login retry when iSCSI initiator to target IO
timeout or connection failure. Valid value is from 0 to 60*60, default to 60 seconds.
The syntax for the remove subcommand is:
 # iscsiadm remove direct_object
The remove subcommand supports the following direct_objects:
discovery-address discovery-address, ...
Removes a target device from the list of discovery addresses. A discovery address (as in the syntax shown below) is
<beginning of page>
an IP address-port combination used in a SendTargets discovery session. Using this discovery approach, a target de<hy>
vice can inform an initiator of the target address and target name of each target exposed by that device. If any target
exposed by the discovery address is currently mounted or there is active I/O on the device, an error of "logical unit in
use" is returned and the operation fails. If the associated devices are not in use, they are removed.
discovery-address must be formatted as:
 <IP address>[:<port>]
There are no options associated with this direct object.
isns-server isns-server, ...
Removes an iSNS server from the list of iSNS server addresses. An iSNS server address (specified in the syntax
shown below) is an IP address-port combination used in an iSNS discovery session. By using iSNS discovery, an
iSNS server can provide an initiator with information about a portal and the name of each target that belongs to the
same discovery domain as that of the initiator. If any target discovered by means of iSNS is currently mounted or
there is active I/O on the device, an error of "logical unit in use" is returned and the operation fails. If the associated
devices are not in use, they are removed.
isns-server must be formatted as:
 IP_address[:port]
There are no options associated with this direct object.
static-config static_target, ...
Removes a target from the list of statically discovered targets. If the target being removed is currently mounted or
there is active I/O on the device, an error of "logical unit in use" is returned and the operation fails. If a device is not
in use, it will be removed.
static_target must be formatted as:
 <target-name>,<target-address>[:port-number][,tpgt]
There are no options associated with this direct object.
target-param target-name
Removes target specified by target-name. The target name is formatted as:
 <target-name>
There are no options associated with this direct object. For iSCSI booting when the Solaris I/O multipathing feature
(formerly known as Sun StorEdge Traffic Manager [STMS] or MPxIO) is enabled, you cannot remove the target.
Do not configure a target to be discovered by both static and dynamic discovery methods. The consequence of using
redundant discovery methods might be slow performance when communicating with the iSCSI target device.
The following generic options are supported:
-V, --version Displays version information. Stops interpretation of subsequent arguments.
-?, --help Displays help information. Can be used following an iscsiadm command with no arguments, following a
subcommand, or following a subcommand-direct object combination. Responds with help information appropriate
for your entry. For example, if you enter:
 # iscsiadm modify initiator-node --help
...iscsiadm responds with a display of the options available for that combination of subcommand and direct object.
