int prefixtran_getcap(struct scsi_address *ap, char *cap, int whom);
int prefixtran_setcap(struct scsi_address *ap, char *cap, int value,
 int whom);
Solaris architecture specific (Solaris DDI).
ap Pointer to the scsi_address(9S) structure.
cap Pointer to the string capability identifier.
value Defines the new state of the capability.
whom Specifies whether all targets or only the specified target is affected.
The tran_getcap() and tran_setcap() vectors in the scsi_hba_tran(9S) structure must be initialized during the
HBA driver's attach(9E) to point to HBA entry points to be called when a target driver calls scsi_ifgetcap(9F) and
scsi_ifsetcap(9F).
tran_getcap() is called to get the current value of a capability specific to features provided by the HBA hardware or
driver. The name of the capability cap is the NULL terminated capability string.
If whom is non-zero, the request is for the current value of the capability defined for the target specified by the sc<hy>
si_address(9S) structure pointed to by ap; if whom is 0, all targets are affected; else, the target specified by the sc<hy>
si_address structure pointed to by ap is affected.
tran_setcap() is called to set the value of the capability cap to the value of value. If whom is non-zero, the capability
should be set for the target specified by the scsi_address(9S) structure pointed to by ap; if whom is 0, all targets are
affected; else, the target specified by the scsi_address structure pointed to by ap is affected. It is recommended that
HBA drivers do not support setting capabilities for all targets, that is, whom is 0.
A device may support only a subset of the defined capabilities.
Refer to scsi_ifgetcap(9F) for the list of defined capabilities.
HBA drivers should use scsi_hba_lookup_capstr(9F) to match cap against the canonical capability strings.
tran_setcap() must return 1 if the capability was successfully set to the new value, 0 if the HBA driver does not
support changing the capability, and <mi>1 if the capability was not defined.
tran_getcap() must return the current value of a capability or <mi>1 if the capability was not defined.
