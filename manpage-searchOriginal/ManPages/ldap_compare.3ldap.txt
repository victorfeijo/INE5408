The ldap_compare_s() function is used to perform an LDAP compare operation synchronously. It takes dn, the DN
of the entry upon which to perform the compare, and attr and value, the attribute type and value to compare to those
found in the entry. It returns an LDAP error code, which will be LDAP_COMPARE_TRUE if the entry contains
the attribute value and LDAP_COMPARE_FALSE if it does not. Otherwise, some error code is returned.
The ldap_compare() function is used to perform an LDAP compare operation asynchronously. It takes the same
parameters as ldap_compare_s(), but returns the message id of the request it initiated. The result of the compare
can be obtained by a subsequent call to ldap_result(3LDAP).
The ldap_compare_ext() function initiates an asynchronous compare operation and returns LDAP_SUCCESS if
the request was successfully sent to the server, or else it returns a LDAP error code if not (see ldap_error(3LDAP).
If successful, ldap_compare_ext() places the message id of the request in *msgidp. A subsequent call to ldap_re<hy>
sult(), can be used to obtain the result of the add request.
The ldap_compare_ext_s() function initiates a synchronous compare operation and as such returns the result of the
operation itself.
ldap_compare_s() returns an LDAP error code which can be interpreted by calling one of ldap_perror(3LDAP)
and friends. ldap_compare() returns <mi>1 if something went wrong initiating the request. It returns the non-negative
message id of the request if it was successful.

There is no way to compare binary values using ldap_compare().
