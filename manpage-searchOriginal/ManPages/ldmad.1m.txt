ldmad <-> Logical Domains Agents daemon
/usr/lib/ldoms/ldmad
The ldmad daemon is part of the framework that enables Logical Domain agents to run on a Logical Domain. A
Logical Domain agent is a component that interacts with the control domain for providing features or information.
ldmad is responsible for running agents on a Logical Domain and must be enabled to ensure proper functionality of
all features provided by the domain manager on the control domain. It is started at boot time and has no configura<hy>
tion options.

ldmad uses syslog(3C) to report status and error messages. All of the messages are logged with the LOG_DAE<hy>
MON facility. Error messages are logged with the LOG_ERR and LOG_NOTICE priorities, and informational
messages are logged with the LOG_INFO priority. The default entries in the /etc/syslog.conf file log all of the ld<hy>
mad error messages to the /var/adm/messages log.
The ldmad service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/ldoms/agents:default
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). The service's status can be queried using the svcs(1) command.
