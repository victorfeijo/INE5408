The commands devreserv and devfree are used to manage the availability of devices on a system. These commands
do not place any constraints on the access to the device. They serve only as a centralized bookkeeping point for
those who wish to use them. Processes that do not use devreserv may concurrently use a device with a process that
has reserved that device.
