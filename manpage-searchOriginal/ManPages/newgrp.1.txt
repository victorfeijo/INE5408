newgrp <-> log in to a new group

newgrp [argument]
*newgrp [argument]
+newgrp [argument]
The newgrp command logs a user into a new group by changing a user's real and effective group ID. The user re<hy>
mains logged in and the current directory is unchanged. The execution of newgrp always replaces the current shell
with a new shell, even if the command terminates with an error (unknown group).
Any variable that is not exported is reset to null or its default value. Exported variables retain their values. System
variables (such as PS1, PS2, PATH, MAIL, and HOME), are reset to default values unless they have been exported
by the system or the user. For example, when a user has a primary prompt string (PS1) other than $ (default) and has
not exported PS1, the user's PS1 is set to the default prompt string $, even if newgrp terminates with an error. Note
that the shell command export (see sh(1) and set(1)) is the method to export variables so that they retain their as<hy>
signed value when invoking new shells.
With no operands and options, newgrp changes the user's group IDs (real and effective) back to the group specified
in the user's password file entry. This is a way to exit the effect of an earlier newgrp command.
A password is demanded if the group has a password and the user is not listed in /etc/group as being a member of
that group. The only way to create a password for a group is to use passwd(1), then cut and paste the password from
/etc/shadow to /etc/group. Group passwords are antiquated and not often used.
Equivalent to exec newgrp argument where argument represents the options and/or operand of the newgrp com<hy>
mand.
Equivalent to exec to/bin/newgrp argument where argument represents the options and/or operand of the newgrp
command.
On this man page, ksh(1) commands that are preceded by one or two * (asterisks) are treated specially in the follow<hy>
ing ways: 1. Variable assignment lists preceding the command remain in effect when the command completes. 2.
I/O redirections are processed after variable assignments. 3. Errors cause a script that contains them to abort. 4.
Words, following a command preceded by ** that are in the format of a variable assignment, are expanded with the
same rules as a variable assignment. This means that tilde substitution is performed after the = sign and word split<hy>
ting and file name generation are not performed.
Equivalent to exec to/bin/newgrp argument where argument represents the options and/or operand of the newgrp
command.
On this man page, ksh93(1) commands that are preceded by one or two + (plus signs) are treated specially in the fol<hy>
lowing ways: 1. Variable assignment lists preceding the command remain in effect when the command completes.
2. I/O redirections are processed after variable assignments. 3. Errors cause a script that contains them to abort. 4.
They are not valid function names. 5. Words, following a command preceded by ++ that are in the format of a vari<hy>

formed after the = sign and field splitting and file name generation are not performed.
The following option is supported:
-l | <mi> Change the environment to what would be expected if the user actually logged in again as a member of the new
group.
The following operands are supported:
group A group name from the group database or a non-negative numeric group ID. Specifies the group ID to which
the real and effective group IDs is set. If group is a non-negative numeric string and exists in the group database as a
group name (see getgrnam(3C)), the numeric group ID associated with that group name is used as the group ID.
argument sh and ksh only. Options and/or operand of the newgrp command.

See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of newgrp: LANG,
LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.
If newgrp succeeds in creating a new shell execution environment, whether or not the group identification was
changed successfully, the exit status is the exit status of the shell. Otherwise, the following exit value is returned:
>0 An error occurred.
/etc/group System group file
/etc/passwd System password file
