The getnetbyaddr(), getnetbyname() and getnetent(), functions each return a pointer to a netent structure, the
members of which contain the fields of an entry in the network database.
The getnetent() function reads the next entry of the database, opening a connection to the database if necessary.
The getnetbyaddr() function searches the database from the beginning, and finds the first entry for which the ad<hy>
dress family specified by type matches the n_addrtype member and the network number net matches the n_net
member, opening a connection to the database if necessary. The net argument is the network number in host byte or<hy>
der.
The getnetbyname() function searches the database from the beginning and finds the first entry for which the net<hy>
work name specified by name matches the n_name member, opening a connection to the database if necessary.
The setnetent() function opens and rewinds the database. If the stayopen argument is non-zero, the connection to
the net database will not be closed after each call to getnetent() (either directly, or indirectly through one of the oth<hy>
er getnet*() functions).
The endnetent() function closes the database.
The getnetbyaddr(), getnetbyname() and getnetent(), functions may return pointers to static data, which may be
overwritten by subsequent calls to any of these functions.
These functions are generally used with the Internet address family.
On successful completion, getnetbyaddr(), getnetbyname() and getnetent(), return a pointer to a netent structure
if the requested entry was found, and a null pointer if the end of the database was reached or the requested entry was
not found. Otherwise, a null pointer is returned.
No errors are defined.
