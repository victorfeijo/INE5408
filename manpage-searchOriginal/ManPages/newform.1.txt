newform <-> change the format of a text file
newform [-s] [-itabspec] [-otabspec] [-bn] [-en] [-pn]
 [-an] [-f] [-cchar] [-ln] [filename]...
newform reads lines from the named filenames, or the standard input if no input file is named, and reproduces the
lines on the standard output. Lines are reformatted in accordance with command line options in effect.
Except for -s, command line options may appear in any order, may be repeated, and may be intermingled with the
optional filenames. Command line options are processed in the order specified. This means that option sequences
like ``-e15 -l60'' will yield results different from ``-l60 -e15''. Options are applied to all filenames on the command
line.
The following options are supported:
-s Shears off leading characters on each line up to the first tab and places up to 8 of the sheared characters at the end
of the line. If more than 8 characters (not counting the first tab) are sheared, the eighth character is replaced by a *
and any characters to the right of it are discarded. The first tab is always discarded.
An error message and program exit will occur if this option is used on a file without a tab on each line. The charac<hy>
ters sheared off are saved internally until all other options specified are applied to that line. The characters are then
added at the end of the processed line.
For example, to convert a file with leading digits, one or more tabs, and text on each line, to a file beginning with the
text, all tabs after the first expanded to spaces, padded with spaces out to column 72 (or truncated to column 72), and
the leading digits placed starting at column 73, the command would be:
newform -s -i -l -a -e filename
-itabspec Input tab specification: expands tabs to spaces, according to the tab specifications given. Tabspec recog<hy>
nizes all tab specification forms described in tabs(1). In addition, tabspec may be -, in which newform assumes that
the tab specification is to be found in the first line read from the standard input (see fspec(4)). If no tabspec is given,
tabspec defaults to <mi>8. A tabspec of <mi>0 expects no tabs; if any are found, they are treated as <mi>1.
-otabspec Output tab specification: replaces spaces by tabs, according to the tab specifications given. The tab specifi<hy>
cations are the same as for -itabspec. If no tabspec is given, tabspec defaults to <mi>8. A tabspec of <mi>0 means that no
spaces will be converted to tabs on output.
-bn Truncate n characters from the beginning of the line when the line length is greater than the effective line length
(see <mi>ln). Default is to truncate the number of characters necessary to obtain the effective line length. The default
value is used when -b with no n is used. This option can be used to delete the sequence numbers from a COBOL
program as follows:
newform -l1 -b7 filename
-en Same as -bn except that characters are truncated from the end of the line.
-pn Prefix n characters (see -cchar) to the beginning of a line when the line length is less than the effective line
length. Default is to prefix the number of characters necessary to obtain the effective line length.
-an Same as -pn except characters are appended to the end of a line.
-f Write the tab specification format line on the standard output before any other lines are output. The tab specifica<hy>
tion format line which is printed will correspond to the format specified in the last -o option. If no -o option is speci<hy>
fied, the line which is printed will contain the default specification of <mi>8.
-cchar Change the prefix/append character to char. Default character for char is a space.
<beginning of page>
-ln Set the effective line length to n characters. If n is not entered, -l defaults to 72. The default line length without
the -l option is 80 characters. Note: Tabs and backspaces are considered to be one character (use -i to expand tabs to
spaces).
The <mi>l1 must be used to set the effective line length shorter than any existing line in the file so that the -b option is
activated.
The following operand is supported:
filename Input file
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful operation.

usage: ...
newform was called with a bad option.
"not -s format"
There was no tab on one line.
"can't open file"
Self-explanatory.
"internal line too long"
A line exceeds 512 characters after being expanded in the internal work buffer.
"tabspec in error"
A tab specification is incorrectly formatted, or specified tab stops are not ascending.
"tabspec indirection illegal"
A tabspec read from a file (or standard input) may not contain a tabspec referencing another file (or standard input).
newform normally only keeps track of physical characters; however, for the -i and -o options, newform will keep
track of backspaces in order to line up tabs in the appropriate logical columns.
newform will not prompt the user if a tabspec is to be read from the standard input (by use of -i- or -o-).
<beginning of page>
If the -f option is used, and the last -o option specified was -o-, and was preceded by either a -o- or a -i-, the tab
specification format line will be incorrect.
