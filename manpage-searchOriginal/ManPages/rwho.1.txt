rwho <-> who is logged in on local machines
rwho [-a]
The rwho command produces output similar to who(1), but for all machines on your network. If no report has been
received from a machine for 5 minutes, rwho assumes the machine is down, and does not report users last known to
be logged into that machine.
If a user has not typed to the system for a minute or more, rwho reports this idle time. If a user has not typed to the
system for an hour or more, the user is omitted from the output of rwho unless the -a flag is given.
-a Report all users whether or not they have typed to the system in the past hour.

rwho does not work through gateways.
The directory /var/spool/rwho must exist on the host from which rwho is run.
This service takes up progressively more network bandwith as the number of hosts on the local net increases. For
large networks, the cost becomes prohibitive.
The rwho service daemon, in.rwhod(1M), must be enabled for this command to return useful results.
