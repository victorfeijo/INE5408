remove_allocatable <-> remove entries from allocation databases
/usr/sbin/remove_allocatable [-f] -n name
/usr/sbin/remove_allocatable [-f] [-d] -t dev-type
remove_allocatable removes entries of user allocatable devices from the device allocation mechanism. remove_al<hy>
locatable also removes entries of some non-allocatable devices, such as printers, whose label range is managed by
the mechanism.
The following options are supported:
-d Removes system-supplied default attributes of the device type that is specified with -t.
-f Force the removal of an entry. remove_allocatable exits with an error if this option is not specified when an entry
with the specified device name no longer exists.
-n name Removes the entry for the device name.
-t dev-type Removes devices of type dev-type.
When successful, remove_allocatable returns an exit status of 0 (true). remove_allocatable returns a nonzero exit
status in the event of an error. The exit codes are as follows:
1 Invocation syntax error
2 Unknown system error
3 Device name or dev-type not found. This error occurs only when the -f option is not specified.
4 Permission denied. User does not have DAC or MAC access to database.
