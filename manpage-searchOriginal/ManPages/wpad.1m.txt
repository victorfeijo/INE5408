/usr/lib/inet/wpad [-i interface] [-k pre_shared_key_name]
The wpad daemon provides common client functionality for the WiFi Protected Access (WPA) versions 1 and 2, as
defined by IEEE802.11i standard. WPA was created by the WiFi Alliance, an industry trade group. WPA imple<hy>
ments the majority of the IEEE 802.11i standard, and was intended as an intermediate measure to take the place of
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) while 802.11i was prepared. WPA2 implements the full standard.
wpad provides the following WPA/IEEE 802.11i features: <bu> WPA-PSK ("WPA-Personal") <bu> Key management for
CCMP, TKIP, WEP104, WEP40

 # dladm connect-wifi
...to start the wpad daemon. Use:
 # dladm disconnect-wifi
