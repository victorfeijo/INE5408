int thr_setconcurrency(int new_level);

These functions are obsolete and maintained for compatibility only. The thr_setconcurrency() function updates the
desired concurrency level that libthread maintains for the calling process. This value does not affect the behavior of
the calling process.
The thr_getconcurrency() function returns the current value for the desired concurrency level.
The thr_getconcurrency() function always returns the current value for the desired concurrency level.
If successful, the thr_setconcurrency() function returns 0. Otherwise, a non-zero value is returned to indicate the
error.
The thr_setconcurrency() function will fail if:
EAGAIN The specified concurrency level would cause a system resource to be exceeded.
EINVAL The value for new_level is negative.
