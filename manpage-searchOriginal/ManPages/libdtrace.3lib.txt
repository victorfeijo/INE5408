libdtrace <-> DTrace dynamic tracing software library
Functions in this library define the interface for interacting with the DTrace dynamic tracing software, including the
D language compiler and facilities for enabling probes and consuming trace data.
The interfaces provided by libdtrace.so.1 are currently private to the implementation of the Solaris system and
DTrace subsystem and are subject to change at any time without notice. Applications using these interfaces might
fail to run on future releases. Refer to the Solaris Dynamic Tracing Guide for a description of the public documented
interfaces available for the DTrace facility.
