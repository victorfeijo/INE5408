int endwin(void);
bool isendwin(void);
The endwin() function restores the terminal after Curses activity by at least restoring the saved shell terminsl mode,
flushing any output to the terminal, and moving the cursor to the first column of the last line of the screen. Refresh<hy>
ing a window resumes program mode. The application must call endwin() for each terminal being used before exit<hy>
ing. If newterm(3XCURSES) is called more than once for the same terminal, the first screen created must be the
last one for which endwin() is called.
The isendiwin() function indicates whether or not a screen has been refreshed since the last call to endwin().
Upon successful completion, the endwin() function returns OK. Otherwise, it returns ERR.
The isendwin() function returns TRUE if endwin() has been called without any subsequent refresh. Otherwise, it
returns FALSE.
Non errors are defined.
