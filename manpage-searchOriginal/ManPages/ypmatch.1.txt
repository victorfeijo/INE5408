ypmatch <-> print the value of one or more keys from a NIS map
ypmatch [-k] [-t] [-d domain] key [key]... mname
ypmatch -x
ypmatch prints the values associated with one or more keys from the NIS's name services map specified by mname,
which may be either a map name or a map nickname.
Multiple keys can be specified; all keys will be searched for in the same map. The keys must be the same case and
length. No pattern matching is available. If a key is not matched, a diagnostic message is produced.
The following options are supported:
-k Before printing the value of a key, print the key itself, followed by a colon (:).
-t Inhibit map nickname translation.
-d domain Specify a domain other than the default domain.
-x Display the map nickname table. This lists the nicknames the command knows of, and indicates the map name as<hy>
sociated with each nickname.
The following operand is supported:
mname The NIS's name services map
The following exit values are returned:
