gettable <-> get DoD Internet format host table from a host
/usr/sbin/gettable host
gettable is a simple program used to obtain the DoD Internet host table from a "hostname" server. The specified
host is queried for the table. The table is placed in the file hosts.txt.
gettable operates by opening a TCP connection to the port indicated in the service specification for "hostname". A
request is then made for all names and the resultant information is placed in the output file.
gettable is best used in conjunction with the htable(1M) program which converts the DoD Internet host table format
to that used by the network library lookup routines.
