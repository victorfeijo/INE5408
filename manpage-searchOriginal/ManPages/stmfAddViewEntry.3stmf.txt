int stmfAddViewEntry(stmfGuid *logicalUnit,
 stmfViewEntry *viewEntry);
logicalUnit The identifier of the logical unit to which this view entry is being added.
viewEntry The view entry to add to the specified logical unit identifier.
The stmfAddViewEntry() function adds a view entry for a given logical unit.
The following values are returned:
STMF_ERROR_LUN_IN_USE The specified logical unit number is already in use for this logical unit.
STMF_ERROR_NOT_FOUND The ID specified for logicalUnit was not found in the system.
STMF_ERROR_VE_CONFLICT Adding this view entry is in conflict with one or more existing view entries.
STMF_STATUS_SUCCESS The API call was successful.

If luNbrValid in the stmfViewEntry structure is set to B_FALSE, the framework will assign a logical unit number
for this view entry. veIndexValid must be set to B_FALSE when adding a view entry. On successful return, veIndex<hy>
Valid will be set to B_TRUE and veIndex will contain the view entry index assigned to this view entry by the frame<hy>
work.
