profile <-> DTrace profile interrupt provider
The profile driver is a DTrace dynamic tracing provider that adds time-based interrupt event sources that can be used
as DTrace probes.
Each profile event source is a time-based interrupt firing every fixed, specified time interval. You can use these
probes to sample some aspect of system state every unit time and the samples can then be used to infer system be<hy>
havior. If the sampling rate is high, or the sampling time is long, an accurate inference is possible. By using the
DTrace facility to bind arbitrary actions to probes, you can use the profile provider to sample practically anything in
the system. For example, you could sample the state of the current thread, the CPU state, or the current machine in<hy>
struction each time a probe fires.
The profile driver is not a public interface and you access the instrumentation offered by this provider through
DTrace. Refer to the Solaris Dynamic Tracing Guide for a description of the public documented interfaces available
for the DTrace facility and the probes offered by the profile provider.
