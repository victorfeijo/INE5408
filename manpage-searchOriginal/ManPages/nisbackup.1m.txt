nisbackup <-> backup NIS+ directories
nisbackup [-v] backup-dir directory...
nisbackup [-v] -a backup-dir
nisbackup backs up a NIS+ directory object on a NIS+ master server. Updates to the NIS+ database will be tempo<hy>
rarily disabled while nisbackup is running. The backup-dir is a UNIX directory that must exist prior to running nis<hy>
backup. The nisbackup command can be used to backup an individual NIS+ directory object or all ( -a) of the
NIS+ directory objects served by a master server. The NIS+ directory objects being backed up will be placed into
subdirectories under the backup-dir directory. These subdirectories are named according to the NIS+ directory ob<hy>
ject they contain. nisbackup operates on individual NIS+ directory objects (for example, org_dir.wiz.com). This al<hy>
lows an administrator to selectively backup specific directories.
The rpc.nisd(1M) process must be running on the master server with a stable NIS+ database for nisbackup to com<hy>
plete. nisbackup will not attempt to correct any corruption in the NIS+ database, so it is important that backups be
done regularly as part of the NIS+ administration.
The first synopsis is used to backup a single NIS+ directory object or a list of NIS+ directory objects. The objects
can be partially qualified or fully qualified. The machine on which the command is executing must be the master for
the NIS+ directory objects specified.
The second synopsis will backup all of the NIS+ directory objects that are served by this master. The -a option is the
recommended method of backing up a master server, since it will backup all NIS+ directory objects that are served
by this master. If this server is a master server for more than one domain, the backup will include NIS+ directories
that belong to all of the domains served. Individual NIS+ directory objects can be selected for restoring from a back<hy>
up-dir created with the -a option. See nisrestore(1M).
The -a option only includes directory objects for which this server is the master. It is possible, but not recommended,
to configure a master server as a replica for other domains. The objects belonging to those replicated domains will
not be backed up with the -a option. The backup of replicated objects must be run on the master server for those ob<hy>
jects.
Do not use the same backup-dir to backup different master servers. Each master server must have its own backup-
dir.
nisbackup will set the rpc.nisd(1M) to read only mode, which will disable updates to the NIS+ database. This is
neccessary to ensure the consistency of the backup. For this reason, nisbackup should not be run while large num<hy>
bers of updates are being applied to the NIS+ database. Update utilities such as nisaddent(1M) should not be run si<hy>
multaneously with nisbackup.
-a Creates a backup of all NIS+ directory objects for which this server is a master.
-v Verbose option. Additional output will be produced and sent to syslog(3C) upon execution of the command (see
syslog.conf(4)).
backup-dir The directory into which the subdirectories containing the backed up objects are placed. This must be
created prior to running nisbackup.
directory The NIS+ directory object(s) being backed up.
Example 1 Backup of the org_dir NIS+ directory object of the domain foo.com on a master server to a directory
named /backup
To backup the org_dir NIS+ directory object of the domain foo.com on a master server to a directory named /back<hy>
up:
 master_server# nisbackup /backup org_dir.foo.com.
Example 2 Backup of the entire NIS+ domain foo.com to a directory named /backup
<beginning of page>
To backup the entire NIS+ domain foo.com to a directory named /backup:
 master_server# nisbackup /backup foo.com. \
  org_dir.foo.com. groups_dir.foo.com. \
  ctx_dir.foo.com.
Example 3 Backup of an entire NIS+ database to a backup directory named /backup
To backup an entire NIS+ database to a backup directory named /backup:
 master_server# nisbackup -a /backup
0 Successful completion.
1 An error occurred.

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
NIS+ to LDAP are available in the current Solaris release. For more information, visit http://www.sun.com/directo<hy>
