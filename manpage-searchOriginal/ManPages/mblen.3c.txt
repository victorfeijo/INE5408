mblen <-> get number of bytes in a character
#include <stdlib.h>
int mblen(const char *s, size_t n);
If s is not a null pointer, mblen() determines the number of bytes constituting the character pointed to by s. It is
equivalent to:
mbtowc((wchar_t *)0, s, n);
A call with s as a null pointer causes this function to return 0. The behavior of this function is affected by the
LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.
If s is a null pointer, mblen() returns 0. It s is not a null pointer, mblen() returns 0 (if s points to the null byte), the
number of bytes that constitute the character (if the next n or fewer bytes form a valid character), or <mi>1 (if they do
not form a valid character) and may set errno to indicate the error. In no case will the value returned be greater than
n or the value of the MB_CUR_MAX macro.
The mblen() function may fail if:
EILSEQ Invalid character sequence is detected.
The mblen() function can be used safely in multithreaded applications, as long as setlocale(3C) is not being called
to change the locale.
