praudit <-> print contents of an audit trail file
praudit [-lrsx] [-ddel] [filename]...
praudit reads the listed filenames (or standard input, if no filename is specified) and interprets the data as audit trail
records as defined in audit.log(4). By default, times, user and group IDs (UIDs and GIDs, respectively) are convert<hy>
ed to their ASCII representation. Record type and event fields are converted to their ASCII representation. A maxi<hy>
mum of 100 audit files can be specified on the command line.
The following options are supported:
-ddel
Use del as the field delimiter instead of the default delimiter, which is the comma. If del has special meaning for the
shell, it must be quoted. The maximum size of a delimiter is three characters. The delimiter is not meaningful and is
not used when the -x option is specified.
-l
Print one line per record.
-r
Print records in their raw form. Times, UIDs, GIDs, record types, and events are displayed as integers. This option
is useful when naming services are offline. The -r option and the -s option are exclusive. If both are used, a format
usage error message is output.
-s
Display records in their short form. Numeric fields' ASCII equivalents are looked up by means of the sources speci<hy>
fied in the /etc/nsswitch.conf file (see nsswitch.conf(4)). All numeric fields are converted to ASCII and then dis<hy>
played. The short ASCII representations for the record type and event fields are used. This option and the -r option
are exclusive. If both are used, a format usage error message is output.
-x
Print records in XML form. Tags are included in the output to identify tokens and fields within tokens. Output begins
with a valid XML prolog, which includes identification of the DTD which can be used to parse the XML.
/etc/security/audit_event
Audit event definition and class mappings.
/etc/security/audit_class
Audit class definitions.
