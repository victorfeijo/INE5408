int drv_priv(cred_t *cr);
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI).
cr Pointer to the user credential structure.
The drv_priv() function provides a general interface to the system privilege policy. It determines whether the cre<hy>
dentials supplied by the user credential structure pointed to by cr identify a process that has the {PRIV_SYS_DE<hy>
VICES} privilege asserted in its effective set. This function should be used only when file access modes, special mi<hy>
nor device numbers, and the device policy (see privileges(5), add_drv(1M)) are insufficient to provide protection
for the requested driver function. It is intended to replace all calls to suser() and any explicit checks for effective us<hy>
er ID = 0 in driver code.
This routine returns 0 if it succeeds, EPERM if it fails.
The drv_priv() function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context.
