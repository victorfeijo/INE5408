The Domain Configuration Server (DCS) is a daemon process that runs on Sun servers that support remote Dynamic
Reconfiguration (DR) clients. It is started by the Service Management Facility (see smf(5)) when the first DR re<hy>
quest is received from a client connecting to the network service sun-dr. After the DCS accepts a DR request, it uses
the libcfgadm(3LIB) interface to execute the DR operation. After the operation is performed, the results are returned
to the client.
The DCS listens on the network service labeled sun-dr. Its underlying protocol is TCP. It is invoked as a server pro<hy>
gram by the SMF using the TCP transport. The fault management resource identifier (FMRI) for DCS is:
 svc:/platform/sun4u/dcs:default
If you disable this service, DR operations initiated from a remote host fail. There is no negative impact on the server.
Security for the DCS connection is provided differently based upon the architecture of the system. The SMF speci<hy>
fies the correct options when invoking the DCS daemon, based upon the current architecture. For all architectures,
security is provided on a per-connection basis.
The DCS daemon has no security options that are applicable when used on a Sun Enterprise 10000 system. So there
are no options applicable to that architecture.
The security options for Sun Fire high-end systems are based on IPsec options defined as SMF properties. These op<hy>
tions include the -a auth, -e encr, and -u esp_auth options, and can be set using the svccfg(1M) command. These op<hy>
tions must match the IPsec policies defined for DCS on the system controller. Refer to the kmd(1M) man page in
the System Management Services (SMS) Reference Manual. The kmd(1M) man page is not part of the SunOS man
page collection.
Security on SPARC Enterprise Servers is not configurable. The DCS daemon uses a platform-specific library to con<hy>
figure its security options when running on such systems. The -l option is provided by the SMF when invoking the
DCS daemon on SPARC Enterprise Servers. No other security options to the DCS daemon should be used on
SPARC Enterprise Servers.
The following options are supported:
-a auth Controls the IPsec Authentication Header (AH) algorithm. auth can be one of none, md5, or sha1.
-e encr Controls the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) encryption algorithm. encr can be one of none,
des, or 3des.
-l Enables the use of platform-specific security options on SPARC Enterprise Servers.
-s sessions Sets the number of active sessions that the DCS allows at any one time. When the limit is reached, the
DCS stops accepting connections until active sessions complete the execution of their DR operation. If this option is
not specified, a default value of 128 is used.
-u esp_auth Controls the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) authentication algorithm. esp_auth can be one
of none, md5, or sha1.
Example 1 Setting an IPSec Option
The following command sets the Authentication Header algorithm for the DCS daemon to use the HMAC-MD5 au<hy>
thentication algorithm. These settings are only applicable for using the DCS daemon on a Sun Fire high-end system.
 # svccfg -s svc:/platform/sun4u/dcs setprop dcs/ah_auth = "md5"
 # svccfg -s svc:/platform/sun4u/dcs setprop dcs/esp_encr = "none"

 # svccfg -s svc:/platform/sun4u/dcs setprop dcs/esp_auth = "none"
 # svcadm refresh svc:/platform/sun4u/dcs
The DCS uses syslog(3C) to report status and error messages. All of the messages are logged with the LOG_DAE<hy>
MON facility. Error messages are logged with the LOG_ERR and LOG_NOTICE priorities, and informational
messages are logged with the LOG_INFO priority. The default entries in the /etc/syslog.conf file log all of the DCS
error messages to the /var/adm/messages log.

The dcs service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the fault management resource identi<hy>
fier (FMRI):
 svc:/platform/sun4u/dcs:default
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). The service's status can be queried using the svcs(1) command.
