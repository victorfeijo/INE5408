The getstr() and wgetstr() functions get a character string from the terminal associated with the window stdscr or
window win, respectively. The mvgetstr() and mvwgetstr() functions move the cursor to the position specified in
stdscr or win, respectively, then get a character string.
These functions call wgetch(3XCURSES) and place each received character in str until a newline is received, which
is also placed in str. The erase and kill characters set by the user are processed.
The getnstr(), mvgetnstr(), mvwgetnstr() and wgetnstr() functions read at most n characters. These functions are
used to prevent overflowing the input buffer.
The getnstr(), wgetnstr(), mvgetnstr(), and mvwgetnstr() functions only return complete multibyte characters. If
the area pointed to by str is not large enough to hold at least one character, these functions fail.
str Is a pointer to the area where the character string is to be placed.
n Is the maximum number of characters to read from input.
y Is the y (row) coordinate of starting position of character string to be read.
x Is the x (column) coordinate of starting position of character string to be read.
win Points to the window associated with the terminal from which the character is to be read.
On success, these functions return OK. Otherwise, they return ERR.
None.
