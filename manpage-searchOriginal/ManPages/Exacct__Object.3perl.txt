Exacct::Object <-> exacct object manipulation
use Sun::Solaris::Exacct::Object qw(:ALL);
print($ea_obj->value(), "\n");
This module is used as a parent of the two possible types of Perl exacct objects: Items and Groups. An Item is either
a single data value such as the number of seconds of user CPU time consumed by a process, an embedded Perl exac<hy>
ct object, or a block of raw data. A Group is an ordered collection of Perl exacct Items such as all of the resource
usage values for a particular process or task. If Groups need to be nested within each other, the inner Groups can be
stored as embedded Perl exacct objects inside the enclosing Group.
This module contains methods that are common to both Perl exacct Items and Groups. The attributes of Sun::So<hy>
laris::Exacct::Object and all classes derived from it are read-only after initial creation with new(). This behavior
prevents the inadvertent modification of the attributes that could produce inconsistent catalog tags and data values.
The only exception is the array used to store the Items inside a Group object, which can be modified using the nor<hy>
mal Perl array operators. See the value() method below.
EO_ERROR, EO_NONE, EO_ITEM, and EO_GROUP.
None.
dump($object, $filehandle) This method dumps formatted text representation of a Perl exacct object to the supplied
file handle. If no file handle is specified, the text representation is dumped to STDOUT. See EXAMPLES below for
sample output.
type() This method returns the type field of the Perl exacct object. The value of the type field is returned as a dual-
typed scalar and is either EO_ITEM, EO_GROUP, or EO_NONE.
catalog() This method returns the catalog field of the Perl exacct object. The value is returned as a Sun::So<hy>
laris::Exacct::Catalog object.
match_catalog($catalog) This method matches the passed catalog tag against the object. True is returned of a
match occurs. Otherwise false is returned. This method has the same behavior as the underlying ea_match_ob<hy>
ject_catalog(3EXACCT) function.
value() This method returns the value of the Perl exacct object. In the case of an Item, this object will normally be a
Perl scalar, either a number or string. For raw Items, the buffer contained inside the object is returned as a Perl string
that can be manipulated with the Perl unpack() function. If the Item contains either a nested Item or a nested Group,
the enclosed Item is returned as a reference to an object of the appropriate subtype of the Sun::Solaris::Exac<hy>
ct::Object class.
For Group objects, if value() is called in a scalar context, the return value is a reference to the underlying array used
to store the component Items of the Group. Since this array can be manipulated with the normal Perl array indexing
syntax and array operators, the objects inside the Group can be manipulated. All objects in the array must be derived
from the Sun::Solaris::Exacct::Object class. Any attempt to insert something else into the array will generate a fa<hy>
tal runtime error that can be caught with an eval { } block.
If value() is called in a list context for a Group object, it returns a list of all the objects in the Group. Unlike the ar<hy>
ray reference returned in a scalar context, this list cannot be manipulated to add or delete Items from a Group. This
mechanism is considerably faster than the array mechanism described above and is the preferred mechanism if a
Group is being examined in a read-only manner.
By default nothing is exported from this module. The following tags can be used to selectively import constants and
functions defined in this module:
:CONSTANTS EO_ERROR, EO_NONE, EO_ITEM, and EO_GROUP
:ALL :CONSTANTS
