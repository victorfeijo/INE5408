The mlib_SignalLPCPerceptWeight_S16() function performs perceptual weighting on input signal.
The perceptual weighting filter is defined as following.
   A(z*r1)
  W(z) = ---------
   A(z*r2)
where A(z) is the inverse filter
   M -i
  A(z) = 1 - SUM a(i) * z
   i=1
See G.723.1, G.728, G.729, G.729A, GSM EFR standards.
The function takes the following arguments:
sigwgt The weighted signal vector, the signal samples are in Q15 format.
signal The input signal vector, the signal samples are in Q15 format.
lpc The linear prediction coefficients.
lscale The scaling factor of the linear prediction coefficients, where actual_data = input_data * 2**(-scaling_fac<hy>
tor).
r1 The perceptual weighting filter coefficient, the coefficient is in Q15 format, it is treated as 1 if 0 is supplied.
r2 The perceptual weighting filter coefficient, the coefficient is in Q15 format, it is treated as 1 if 0 is supplied.
state Pointer to the internal state structure.
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
