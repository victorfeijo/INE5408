net_lifgetnext <-> search through a list of logical network interfaces
#include <sys/neti.h>
net_if_t net_lifgetnext(const net_data_t net, const phy_if_t ifp,
 net_if_t lif);
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
net value returned from a successful call to net_protocol_lookup(9F).
ifp value returned from a successful call to net_phylookup(9F) or net_phygetnext(9F).
lif value returned from a successful call to this function.
The net_lifgetnext() function is used to search through all of the logical interfaces that are associated with a physi<hy>
cal network interface. To start searching through this list, a value of 0 should be passed through as the value of lif.
When 0 is returned by this function, the last of the interfaces owned by this protocol has been reached.
When called successfully, the value returned represents a logical interface that exists, at the time of the call, within
the scope of the network interface and its assigned network protocol. This value is only guaranteed to be unique for a
name within the scope of the network interface and its assigned protocol.
  net_data_t net;
  phy_if_t ifp;

  char buffer[32];
  net_ifaddr_t atype[1];
  struct sockaddr_in sin[1];
  net = net_protocol_lookup("inet");
  if (net != NULL) {
  atype[0] = NA_ADDRESS;
  ifp = net_phylookup(net, "hme0");
  for (lif = net_lifgetnext(net, 0); lif != 0;
  lif = net_lifgetnext(net, lif)) {
  /* Do something with lif */
  if (net_getlifaddr(net, ifp, lif, 1, atype, sin) == 0)
  printf("hme0:%d %x0, lif,
  ntohl(sin[0].sin_addr.s_addr));
  }
  }
The net_lifgetnext() function returns a value of -1 if it is not supported by the network protocol and a value of 0 if
an attempt to go beyond the last network interface is made. Otherwise, it returns a value representing a network in<hy>
terface.
The net_lifgetnext() function may be called from user, kernel, or interrupt context.
