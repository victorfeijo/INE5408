ipnat <-> user interface to the NAT subsystem
ipnat [-CdFhlnRrsv] -f filename
The ipnat utility opens a specified file (treating - as stdin) and parses it for a set of rules that are to be added or re<hy>
moved from the IP NAT.
If there are no parsing problems, each rule processed by ipnat is added to the kernel's internal lists. Rules are ap<hy>
pended to the internal lists, matching the order in which they appear when given to ipnat.
ipnat's use is restricted through access to /dev/ipauth, /dev/ipl, and /dev/ipstate. The default permissions of these
files require ipnat to be run as root for all operations.
ipnat's use is restricted through access to /dev/ipnat. The default permissions of /dev/ipnat require ipnat to be run
as root for all operations.
The following options are supported:
-C Delete all entries in the current NAT rule listing (NAT rules).
-d Turn debug mode on. Causes a hex dump of filter rules to be generated as it processes each one.
-F Delete all active entries in the current NAT translation table (currently active NAT mappings).
-f filename Parse specified file for rules to be added or removed from the IP NAT. filename can be stdin.
-h Print number of hits for each MAP/Redirect filter.
-l Show the list of current NAT table entry mappings.
-n Prevents ipf from doing anything, such as making ioctl calls, which might alter the currently running kernel.
-R Disable both IP address-to-hostname resolution and port number-to-service name resolution.
-r Remove matching NAT rules rather than add them to the internal lists.
-s Retrieve and display NAT statistics.
-v Turn verbose mode on. Displays information relating to rule processing and active rules/table entries.
