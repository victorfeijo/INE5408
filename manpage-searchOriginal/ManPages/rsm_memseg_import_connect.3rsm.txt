The rsm_memseg_import_connect() function provides a means of creating an import segment called memseg and
establishing a logical connection with an export segment identified by the segment_id on the node specified by
node_id. The controller specified by controller must have a physical connection with the controller (see rsm_get_in<hy>
terconnect_topology(3RSM)) used while exporting the segment identified by segment_id on node specified by
node_id. The perm argument specifies the mode of access that the importer is requesting for this connection. In the
connection process, the mode of access and the importers userid and groupid are compared with the access permis<hy>
sions specified by the exporter. If the request mode is not valid, the connection request is denied. The perm argument
is limited to the following octal values:
0400 read mode
0200 write mode
0600 read/write mode 
The rsm_memseg_import_disconnect() function breaks the logical connection between the import segment and the
exported segment and deallocates the resources associated with the import segment handle memseg.
Upon successful completion, these functions return 0. Otherwise, an error value is returned to indicate the error.
The rsm_memseg_import_connect() and rsm_memseg_import_disconnect() functions can return the following
errors:
RSMERR_BAD_SEG_HNDL Invalid segment handle.
The rsm_memseg_import_connect() function can return the following errors:
RSMERR_BAD_CTLR_HNDL
Invalid controller handle.
RSMERR_CTLR_NOT_PRESENT
Controller not present.
RSMERR_PERM_DENIED
Permission denied.
RSMERR_INSUFFICIENT_MEM
Insufficient memory.
RSMERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES
Insufficient resources.

RSMERR_SEG_NOT_PUBLISHED_TO_NODE
Segment not published to node.
RSMERR_SEG_NOT_PUBLISHED
Segment not published at all.
RSMERR_BAD_ADDR
Bad address.
RSMERR_REMOTE_NODE_UNREACHABLE
Remote not not reachable.
RSMERR_INTERRUPTED
Connection interrupted.
The rsm_memseg_import_disconnect() function can return the following errors:
RSMERR_SEG_STILL_MAPPED Segment still mapped, need to unmap before disconnect.
RSMERR_POLLFD_IN_USE Poll file descriptor in use.
