int listen(int s, int backlog);
To accept connections, a socket is first created with socket(3SOCKET), a backlog for incoming connections is
specified with listen() and then the connections are accepted with accept(3SOCKET). The listen() call applies only
to sockets of type SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_SEQPACKET.
The backlog parameter defines the maximum length the queue of pending connections may grow to.
If a connection request arrives with the queue full, the client will receive an error with an indication of ECONNRE<hy>
FUSED for AF_UNIX sockets. If the underlying protocol supports retransmission, the connection request may be
ignored so that retries may succeed. For AF_INET and AF_INET6sockets, the TCP will retry the connection. If
the backlog is not cleared by the time the tcp times out, the connect will fail with ETIMEDOUT.
A 0 return value indicates success; <mi>1 indicates an error.
The call fails if:
EBADF The argument s is not a valid file descriptor.
ENOTSOCK The argument s is not a socket.
EOPNOTSUPP The socket is not of a type that supports the operation listen().
