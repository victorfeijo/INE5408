Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
netid value from either callback registered with net_instance_register() or net_zoneidtonetid().
callback function to call when a change occurs.
arg pointer to pass into the callback() function when a change occurs.
The net_instance_notify_register() function registers a function represented by the pointer callback to be called
when there is a new instance added or removed from the given network instance (represented by netid.)
The net_instance_notify_unregister() function indicates that there is no longer any desire to receive notification of
changes to the instance through function calls to the specified callback.
Multiple callback functions may be registered through this interface. The same set of parameters is passed to each
callback function. The memory referenced through the pointers passed to the callback should be treated as pointing
to read-only memory. Changing this data is strictly prohibited.
The function that is called must not block any other events.
The arguments passed through to the callback are as follows (the command is either HN_REGISTER or HN_UN<hy>
REGISTER):
name1 is the netid represented as a string.
name2 is NULL.
name3 is the name of the instance being added/removed
If these functions succeed, 0 is returned. Otherwise, the following error is returned:
EEXIST the given callback function is already registered.
These functions may be called from user or kernel context.
