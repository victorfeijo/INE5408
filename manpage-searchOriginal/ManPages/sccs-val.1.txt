sccs-val, val <-> validate an SCCS file
val [-s] [-m name] [-rsid] [-y type] s.filename...
The val utility determines if the specified s.files meet the characteristics specified by the indicated arguments. val
can process up to 50 files on a single command line.
val has a special argument, `<mi>', which reads the standard input until the end-of-file condition is detected. Each line
read is independently processed as if it were a command line argument list.
val generates diagnostic messages on the standard output for each command line and file processed and also returns
a single 8<mi>bit code upon exit as described below.
The 8-bit code returned by val is a disjunction of the possible errors, that is, it can be interpreted as a bit string
where (moving from left to right) the bits set are interpreted as follows:
 bit 0 = missing file argument
 bit 1 = unknown or duplicate option
 bit 2 = corrupted s.file
 bit 3 = can not open file or file not in s.file format
 bit 4 = the SCCS delta ID (SID) is invalid or ambiguous
 bit 5 = the SID does not exist
 bit 6 = mismatch between Y% and -y argument
 bit 7 = mismatch between sccs-val.1 and -m argument
val can process two or more files on a given command line, and in turn can process multiple command lines (when
reading the standard input). In these cases, an aggregate code is returned which is the logical OR of the codes gener<hy>
ated for each command line and file processed.
The following options are supported:
-s Silent. Suppresses the normal error or warning messages.
-m name Compares name with the %M% ID keyword in the s.file.
-rsid Checks to see if the indicated SID is ambiguous, invalid, or absent from the s.file.
-y type Compares type with the %Y% ID keyword.
See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of val: LANG,
LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.
