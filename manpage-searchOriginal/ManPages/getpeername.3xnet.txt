int getpeername(int socket, struct sockaddr *restrict address,
 socklen_t *restrict address_len);
The getpeername() function retrieves the peer address of the specified socket, stores this address in the sockaddr
structure pointed to by the address argument, and stores the length of this address in the object pointed to by the ad<hy>
dress_len argument.
If the actual length of the address is greater than the length of the supplied sockaddr structure, the stored address
will be truncated.
If the protocol permits connections by unbound clients, and the peer is not bound, then the value stored in the object
pointed to by address is unspecified.
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. Otherwise, <mi>1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
The getpeername() function will fail if:
EBADF The socket argument is not a valid file descriptor.
EFAULT The address or address_len parameter can not be accessed or written.
EINVAL The socket has been shut down.
ENOTCONN The socket is not connected or otherwise has not had the peer prespecified.
ENOTSOCK The socket argument does not refer to a socket.
EOPNOTSUPP The operation is not supported for the socket protocol.
The getpeername() function may fail if:
ENOBUFS Insufficient resources were available in the system to complete the call.
ENOSR There were insufficient STREAMS resources available for the operation to complete.
