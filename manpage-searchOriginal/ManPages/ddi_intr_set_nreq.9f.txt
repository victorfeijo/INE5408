ddi_intr_set_nreq <-> set the number of interrupts requested for a device driver instance
#include <sys/ddi_intr.h>
int ddi_intr_set_nreq(dev_info_t *dip, int nreq);
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
dip Pointer to the dev_info structure.
nreq Number of interrupts requested.
The ddi_intr_set_nreq() function changes the number of interrupts requested by a device driver instance.
The nreq parameter is the total number of interrupt resources that this instance of the device driver would like to
have available. The nreq parameter includes any interrupt resources already allocated by the driver. For example, if
the driver instance already has two MSI-X vectors and it wants two more, it should call this function with an nreq
parameter set to four.
The nreq parameter can be any value between one and the maximum number of interrupts supported by the device
hardware, as reported by a call to the ddi_intr_get_nintrs(9F) function. The driver receives a callback notifying it
in cases when it must release any previously allocated interrupts, or when it is allowed to allocate more interrupts as
a result of its new nreq parameter.
The ddi_intr_set_nreq()function is not supported unless a driver is already consuming interrupts, and if it has a reg<hy>
istered callback handler that can process actions related to changes in interrupt availability. See ddi_cb_register(9F)
for an explanation on how to enable this functionality.
The ddi_intr_set_nreq() function returns:
DDI_SUCCESS on success
DDI_EINVAL The operation is invalid because the nreq parameter is not a legal value
DDI_ENOTSUP The operation is not supported. The driver must have a registered callback, and the system must
have interrupt pools implemented.
DDI_FAILURE Implementation specific failure
These functions can be called from kernel, non-interrupt context.

The Interrupt Resource Management feature is limited to device driver instances that are using MSI-X interrupts (in<hy>
terrupt type DDI_INTR_TYPE_MSIX). Attempts to use this function for any other type of interrupts fails with
DDI_ENOTSUP.
The total number of interrupts requested by the driver is initially defined by the count parameter provided by the
driver's first call to the ddi_intr_alloc(9F) function, specifically during the driver instance's attach(9E) routine. The
ddi_intr_set_nreq() function is only used if the driver instance experiences changes in its I/O load. In response to
<beginning of page>
increased I/O load, the driver may want to request additional interrupt resources. In response to diminished I/O load.
the driver may volunteer to return extra interrupt resources back to the system.
