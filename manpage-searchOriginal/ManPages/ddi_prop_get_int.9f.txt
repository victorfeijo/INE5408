int ddi_prop_get_int(dev_t match_dev, dev_info_t *dip, uint_t flags,
 char *name, int defvalue);
int64_t ddi_prop_get_int64(dev_t match_dev, dev_info_t *dip, uint_t flags,
 char *name, int64_t defvalue);
match_dev Device number associated with property or DDI_DEV_T_ANY.
dip Pointer to the device info node of device whose property list should be searched.
flags Possible flag values are some combination of:
DDI_PROP_DONTPASS Do not pass request to parent device information node if property not found.
DDI_PROP_NOTPROM Do not look at PROM properties (ignored on platforms that do not support PROM prop<hy>
erties).
name String containing the name of the property.
defvalue An integer value that is returned if the property cannot be found.
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
The ddi_prop_get_int() and ddi_prop_get_int64() functions search for an integer property and, if found, returns
the value of the property.
Properties are searched for based on the dip, name, match_dev, and the type of the data (integer). The property
search order is as follows: 1. Search software properties created by the driver. 2. Search the software properties
created by the system (or nexus nodes in the device info tree). 3. Search the driver global properties list. 4. If
DDI_PROP_NOTPROM is not set, search the PROM properties (if they exist). 5. If DDI_PROP_DONTPASS is
not set, pass this request to the parent device information node. 6. Return defvalue.
Usually, the match_dev argument should be set to the actual device number that this property is associated with.
However, if the match_dev argument is DDI_DEV_T_ANY, then ddi_prop_get_int() and ddi_prop_get_int() will
match the request regardless of the match_dev the property was created with. If a property was created with
match_dev set to DDI_DEV_T_NONE, then the only way to look up this property is with a match_dev set to
DDI_DEV_T_ANY. PROM properties are always created with match_dev set to DDI_DEV_T_NONE.
name must always be set to the name of the property being looked up.
The return value of the routine is the value of the property. If the property is not found, the argument defvalue is re<hy>
turned as the value of the property.
ddi_prop_get_int64() will not search the PROM for 64-bit property values.
ddi_prop_get_int() and ddi_prop_get_int64() return the value of the property. If the property is not found, the ar<hy>
gument defvalue is returned. If the property is found, but cannot be decoded into an int or an int64, then
DDI_PROP_NOT_FOUND is returned.
ddi_prop_get_int() and ddi_prop_get_int64() can be called from user or kernel context. Example 1 Using
ddi_prop_get_int()

The following example demonstrates the use of ddi_prop_get_int().
  
 /*
  * Get the value of the integer "width" property, using
  * our own default if no such property exists
  */
  width = ddi_prop_get_int(xx_dev, xx_dip, 0, "width",
   XX_DEFAULT_WIDTH);
