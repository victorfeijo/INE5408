cr pointer to the user credential structure
uid, ruid, euid, suid new user id, real, effective and saved user id
gid, rgid, egid, sgid new group id, real, effective and saved group id
ngroups number of groups in the group array
gids pointer to array of new groups
The user credential is a shared, read-only, ref-counted data structure. Its actual size and layout are subject to change.
The functions described in this page allow the programmer to retrieve fields from the structure and to initialize new<hy>
ly allocated credential structures.
crgetuid(), crgetruid(), and crgetsuid() return, respectively, the effective, real, and saved user id from the user cre<hy>
dential pointed to by cr.
crgetgid(), crgetrgid(), and crgetsgid() return, respectively, the effective, real, and saved group id from the user cre<hy>
dential pointed to by cr.
crgetzoneid() returns the zone id from the user credential pointed to by cr.
crgetgroups() returns the group list of the user credential pointed to by cr.
crgetngroups() returns the number of groups in the user credential pointed to by cr.

crsetresuid() sets the real, effective and saved user id. All but one can be specified as -1, which causes the original
value not to change.
crsetresgid() sets the real, effective and saved group id. All but one can be specified as -1, which causes the original
value not to change.
crsetugid() initializes the real, effective and saved user id all to uid. It initializes the real, effective, and saved group
id all to gid.
crsetgroups() sets the number of groups in the user credential to ngroups and copies the groups from gids to the us<hy>
er credential. If ngroups is 0, gids need not point to valid storage.
It is an error to call this any of the crset*() functions on a user credential structure that was newly allocated.
The crget*() functions return the requested information.
The crset*id() functions return 0 on success and -1 if any of the specified ids are invalid. The functions might cause
a system panic if called on a user credential structure that is referenced by other parts of the system.
These functions can be called from user and kernel contexts.
