When used with no arguments, shareall shares all resources from file, which contains a list of share command lines.
If the operand is a hyphen (<mi>), then the share command lines are obtained from the standard input. Otherwise, if nei<hy>
ther a file nor a hyphen is specified, then the file /etc/dfs/dfstab is used as the default.

argument to -F.
unshareall unshares all currently shared resources. Without a -F flag, it unshares resources for all distributed file
system types.
