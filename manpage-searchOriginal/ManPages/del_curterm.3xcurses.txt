Within X/Open Curses, the setupterm() function is automatically called by the initscr (3XC) and newterm (3XC)
functions. This function can be also be used outside of X/Open Curses when a program has to deal directly with the
terminfo database to handle certain terminal capabilities. The use of appropriate X/Open Curses functions is rec<hy>
ommended in all other situations.
The setupterm() function loads terminal-dependent variables for the terminfo layer of X/Open Curses. The se<hy>
tupterm() function initializes the terminfo variables lines and columns such that if use_env(FALSE) has been
called, the terminfo values assigned in the database are used regardless of the environmental variables LINES and
COLUMNS or the program's window dimensions; when use_env(TRUE) has been called, which is the default, the
environment variables LINES and COLUMNS are used, if they exist. If the environment variables do not exist and
the program is running in a window, the current window size is used.
The term parameter of setupterm() specifies the terminal; if null, terminal type is taken from the TERM environ<hy>
ment variable. All output is sent to fildes which is initialized for output. If errret is not null, OK or ERR is returned
and a status value is stored in the integer pointed to by errret. The following status values may be returned:
tab() box; lw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) ValueDescription 1Normal 0Terminal could not be found -1ter<hy>
minfo database could not be found
If errret is null, an error message is printed, and the setupterm() function calls the exit() function with a non-zero
parameter.
The set_curterm() function sets the cur_term variable to nterm. The values from nterm as well as other state infor<hy>
mation for the terminal are used by X/Open Curses functions such as beep(3XCURSES), flash(3XCURSES),
mvcur(3XCURSES), tigetflag(3XCURSES), tigetstr(3XCURSES), and tigetnum(3XCURSES).
The del_curterm() function frees the space pointed to by oterm. If oterm and the cur_term variable are the same,
all Boolean, numeric, or string terminfo variables will refer to invalid memory locations until you call setupterm()
and specify a new terminal type.
The restartterm() function assumes that a call to setupterm() has already been made (probably from initscr() or
newterm()). It allows you to specify a new terminal type in term and updates the data returned by bau<hy>
drate(3XCURSES) based on fildes. Other information created by the initscr(), newterm(), and setupterm() func<hy>
tions is preserved.
oterm Is the terminal type for which to free space.
term Is the terminal type for which variables are set.
fildes Is a file descriptor initialized for output.
errret Is a pointer to an integer in which the status value is stored.
<beginning of page>
nterm Is the new terminal to become the current terminal.
On success, the set_curterm() function returns the previous value of cur_term. Otherwise, it returns a null pointer.
On success, the other functions return OK. Otherwise, they return ERR.
None.
