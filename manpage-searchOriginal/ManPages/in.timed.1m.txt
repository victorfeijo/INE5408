in.timed <-> UDP or TCP time protocol service daemon
in.timed
FMRI svc:/internet/time:default
FMRI stands for Fault Management Resource Identifier. It is used to identify resources managed by the Fault Man<hy>
ager. See fmd(1M) and smf(5).
The in.timed service provides the server-side of the time protocol. The time server sends to requestors the time in
seconds since midnight, January 1, 1900. The time protocol is available on both TCP and UDP transports through
port 37.
The in.timed service is an inetd(1M) smf(5) delegated service. The in.timed detects which transport is requested by
examining the socket it is passed by the inetd daemon.
TCP-based service Once a connection is established, the in.timed sends the time as a 32-bit binary number and
closes the connection. Any received data is ignored.
UDP-based service The in.timed listens for UDP datagrams. When a datagram is received, the server generates a
UDP datagram containing the time as a 32-bit binary number and sends it to the client. Any received data is ignored.
