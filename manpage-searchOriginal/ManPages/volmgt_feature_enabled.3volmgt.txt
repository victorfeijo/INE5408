int volmgt_feature_enabled(char *feat_str);
This function is obsolete. The management of removable media by the Volume Management feature, including vold,
has been replaced by software that supports the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). Programmatic support for HAL
is through the HAL APIs, which are documented on the HAL web site. See hal(5). The return value of this function
is undefined.
The volmgt_feature_enabled() routine checks whether specific volume management features are enabled.
volmgt_feature_enabled() checks for the volume management features passed in to it by the feat_str parameter.
Currently, the only supported feature string that volmgt_feature_enabled() checks for is floppy-summit-inter<hy>
faces. The floppy-summit-interfaces feature string checks for the presence of the libvolmgt routines volmgt_ac<hy>
quire() and volmgt_release().
The return from this function is undefined. Example 1 A sample of the volmgt_feature_enabled() function.
In the following example, volmgt_feature_enabled() checks whether the floppy-summit-interfaces feature is en<hy>
abled.
 if (volmgt_feature_enabled("floppy-summit-interfaces")) {
  (void) printf("Media Sharing Routines ARE present\n");
 } else {
  (void) printf("Media Sharing Routines are NOT present\n");
 }
