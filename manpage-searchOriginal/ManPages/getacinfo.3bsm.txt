When first called, getacdir() provides information about the first audit directory in the audit_control file. There<hy>
after, it returns the next directory in the file. Successive calls list all the directories listed in audit_control(4) The len
argument specifies the length of the buffer dir. On return, dir points to the directory entry.
The getacmin() function reads the minimum value from the audit_control file and returns the value in min_val. The
minimum value specifies how full the file system to which the audit files are being written can get before the script
audit_warn(1M) is invoked.
The getacflg() function reads the system audit value from the audit_control file and returns the value in auditstring.
The len argument specifies the length of the buffer auditstring.
The getacna() function reads the system audit value for non-attributable audit events from the audit_control file and
returns the value in auditstring. The len argument specifies the length of the buffer auditstring. Non-attributable
events are events that cannot be attributed to an individual user. The inetd(1M) utility and several other daemons
record non-attributable events.
The setac() function rewinds the audit_control file to allow repeated searches.
The endac() function closes the audit_control file when processing is complete.

The getacdir(), getacflg(), getacna(), and getacmin() functions return:
0 on success.
<mi>2 on failure and set errno to indicate the error.
The getacmin() and getacflg() functions return:
1 on EOF.
The getacdir() function returns:
<mi>1 on EOF.
2 if the directory search had to start from the beginning because one of the other functions was called between calls
to getacdir().
These functions return:
<beginning of page>
<mi>3 if the directory entry format in the audit_control file is incorrect.
The getacdir(), getacflg(), and getacna() functions return:
<mi>3 if the input buffer is too short to accommodate the record.
