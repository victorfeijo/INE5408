int pthread_kill(pthread_t thread, int sig);
The pthread_kill() function sends the sig signal to the thread designated by thread. The thread argument must be a
member of the same process as the calling thread. The sig argument must be one of the signals listed in sig<hy>
nal.h(3HEAD), with the exception of SIGCANCEL being reserved and off limits to pthread_kill(). If sig is 0, a
validity check is performed for the existence of the target thread; no signal is sent.
Upon successful completion, the function returns a value of 0. Otherwise the function returns an error number. If the
pthread_kill() function fails, no signal is sent.
The pthread_kill() function will fail if:
ESRCH No thread could be found corresponding to that specified by the given thread ID.
EINVAL The value of the sig argument is an invalid or unsupported signal number.
