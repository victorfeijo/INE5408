MP_STATUS MP_GetProprietaryLoadBalanceOidList(MP_OID oid
 MP_OID_LIST **ppList);
oid The object ID of the plugin.
ppList A pointer to a pointer to an object ID that has type MP_OID_LIST structure. With a successful return, this
contains a pointer to an object ID that has type MP_OID_LIST that contains the object IDs of all the proprietary
load balance types associated with the specified plugin.
The MP_GetProprietaryLoadBalanceOidList() function returns a list of the object IDs of all the proprietary load
balance algorithms associated with this plugin.
When the caller is finished using the list, it must free the memory used by the list by calling MP_FreeOidList.
MP_STATUS_INVALID_OBJECT_TYPE
The oid does not specify any valid object type. This is most likely to happen if an uninitialized object ID is passed to
the API.
MP_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER
The ppList in null or specifies a memory area to which data cannot be written, or if the oid has a type subfield other
than MP_OBJECT_TYPE_PLUGIN.
MP_STATUS_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND
The oid owner ID or object sequence number is invalid.
MP_STATUS_SUCCESS
The operation is successful.
MP_STATUS_FAILED
The plugin for the specified object ID is not found.
MP_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY
