The printers.conf file is the system printing configuration database. System administrators use printers.conf to de<hy>
scribe destinations for the print client commands and the print protocol adaptor. A destination names a printer or
class of printers. See lpadmin(1M). The LP print spooler uses private LP configuration data for represented in the
printers.conf database.
The lpset command can be used to define the printer table in NIS+. It checks to see if the NIS+ table (print<hy>
ers.org_dir) exists and if it does not it goes ahead and creates it in the correct format. See lpset(1M) for more infor<hy>
mation.
Each entry in printers.conf describes one destination. Entries are one line consisting of any number of fields sepa<hy>
rated by colons (`:') and terminated by a NEWLINE. The first field of each entry specifies the name of the destina<hy>
tion and aliases to which the entry describes. Specify one or more names or aliases of the destination in this first
field. Specify the destination using atomic names. URI-style and POSIX-style names are not acceptable. See stan<hy>
dards(5). Separate destination names by pipe signs (`|').
Two destination names are reserved for special use in the first entry. Use _all to specify the interest list for lpget, lp<hy>
stat, and cancel. Use _default to specify the default destination.
The remaining fields in an entry are key=value pairs. See Specifying Configuration Options for details regarding
key=value pairs.
Empty lines can be included for readability. Entries can continue on to multiple lines by adding a backslash (`\') as
the last character in the line. printers.conf can include comments. Comments have a pound sign (`#') as the first
character in the line, and are terminated by a NEWLINE. Use the lpset command to create or modify printers.conf.
See lpset(1M). Do not make changes in printers.conf by using an editor.
key=value pairs are configuration options defined by the system administrator. key and value can be of arbitrary
length. Separate key and value by the equal (`=') character.
The following client/server configuration options (represented as key=value pairs) are supported:
printer-uri-supported=scheme://endpoint
Provides the information necessary to contact the print service for the entry. The scheme generally identifies the
print service or protocol to use. Currently this is limited to lpsched, ipp, and lpd but might be expanded in the fu<hy>
ture. Each of these schemes imposes a set of restrictions for specifying the endpoint and the functionality provided.
lpsched://localhost/printers/queue
 This is URI form is used for print queues that are configured under the local LP service.
ipp://server[:port]/printers/queue
http://server:631/printers/queue
ipp://server[:port]/...
This URI form is used for print queues that are remotely accessible by way of the Internet Print Protocol. This proto<hy>
col is the preferred method of accessing remote print queues because it provides the greatest functionality over the
wire. The ipp uri scheme is specified in the internet print protocol specifications and is much more free form than
listed above. The actual content and format of the endpoint is determined by the remote print service.
lpd://server/printers/queue[#Solaris]
This URI form is used for print queues that are remotely accessable by way of the BSD Print Protocol. Though lim<hy>
ited in capability, this protocol is widely used between client and server. It provides maximium interoperability with
remote print services. When used to communicate with print services on a Solaris print server, the optional #Solaris
component of the URI indicates that Solaris protcol extensions can be used during print job submission.
<beginning of page>
If an entry does not contain a printer-uri-supported key/value pair, the bsdaddr value is converted to its equivalent uri
form and a printer-uri-supported key/value pair is added to the resulting data returned to applications requesting
printer configuration data.
bsdaddr=server,destination[,Solaris]
Sets the server and destination name. Sets if the client generates protocol extensions for use with the lp command
(see lp(1)). Solaris specifies a Solaris print server extension. If Solaris is not specified, no protocol extensions are
generated. server is the name of the host containing the queue for destination. destination is the atomic name by
which the server knows the destination. If the configuration file contents are to be shared with legacy systems (So<hy>
laris 2.6 - Solaris 10), this key/value pair should be provided for backward compatability.
use=destination
Sets the destination to continue searching for configuration information. destination is an atomic, URI-style
(scheme://endpoint), or Posix-style name (server:printer).
all=destination_list
Sets the interest list for the lpget, lpstat, and cancel commands. destination_list is a comma-separated list of desti<hy>
nations. Specify destination using atomic, URI-style (scheme://endpoint), or Posix-style names (server:printer).
See lpget(1M), lpstat(1), and cancel(1).
The following LP configuration options (represented as key=value pairs) are supported:
user-equivalence=true|false
Sets whether or not usernames are considered equivalent when cancelling a print request submitted from a different
host in a networked environment. true means that usernames are considered equivalent, and permits users to cancel
a print requests submitted from a different host. user-equivalence is set to false by default. false means that user<hy>
names are not considered equivalent, and does not permit users cancel a print request submitted from a different
host. If user-equivalence is set to false, print requests can only be cancelled by the users on the host on whichs the
print prequest was generated or by the superuser on the print server.
Applications needing to resolve print queue names (destinations) to the associated print service and communications
endpoint make use of a specific name resolution ordering. Destination names in URI and POSIX form are complete
unto themselves and require no further resolution. Names in atomic form are resolved based on the printers data<hy>
base entry in the /etc/nsswitch.conf file. See nsswitch.conf(4)
The default destination is located differently depending on the command.
The lp command locates the default destination in the following order: 1. lp command's -d destination option. 2.
LPDEST environment variable. 3. PRINTER environment variable. 4. _default destination in $HOME/.print<hy>
ers. 5. _default destination in /etc/printers.conf.
The lpr, lpq, and lprm commands locate the default destination in the following order: 1. lpr command's -P desti<hy>
nation option. 2. PRINTER environment variable. 3. LPDEST environment variable. 4. _default destination in
$HOME/.printers. 5. _default destination in /etc/printers.conf.
The lpget, lpstat, and cancel commands locate the interest list in the following order: 1. _all list in $HOME/.print<hy>
ers. 2. _all list in /etc/printers.conf. Example 1 Setting the Interest List
The following entry sets the interest list for the lpget, lpstat and cancel commands to printer1, printer2 and print<hy>
er3:
 _all:all=printer1,printer2,printer3
Example 2 Setting the Server Name
The following entry sets the server name to server and and printer name to ps_printer for destinations printer1 and
<beginning of page>
ps. It does not generate BSD protocol extensions.
 printer1|ps:bsdaddr=server,ps_printer
Example 3 Setting Server Name and Destination Name
The following entry sets the server name to server and destination name to pcl_printer, for destination printer2. It
also generates Solaris protocol extensions.
 printer2:printer-uri-supported=lpd//server/printers/pcl_printer#Solaris
Example 4 Setting Server Name and Destination Name with Continuous Search
The following entry sets the server name to server and destination name to new_printer, for destination printer3. It
also sets the printer3 to continue searching for configuration information to printer another_printer.
 printer3:bsdaddr=server,new_printer:use=another_printer
Example 5 Setting Default Destination
The following entry sets the default destination to continue searching for configuration information to destination
printer1.
 _default:use=printer1
Example 6 Using IPP as the URI
The following example uses IPP as the URI:
 printer4:printer-uri-supported=ipp\://server/printers/queue
/etc/printers.conf System configuration database
$HOME/.printers User-configurable printer database
ou=printers LDAP version of /etc/printers.conf
printers.conf.byname (NIS) NIS version of /etc/printers.conf
printers.org_dir (NIS+) NIS+ version of /etc/printers.conf
