OM_uint32 gss_import_sec_context(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
 const gss_buffer_t interprocess_token,gss_ctx_id_t *context_handle);
The gss_import_sec_context() function allows a process to import a security context established by another
process. A given interprocess token can be imported only once. See gss_export_sec_context(3GSS).
The parameter descriptions for gss_import_sec_context() are as follows:
minor_status A mechanism-specific status code.
interprocess_token Token received from exporting process.
context_handle Context handle of newly reactivated context. Resources associated with this context handle must be
released by the application after use with a call to gss_delete_sec_context(3GSS).
gss_import_sec_context() returns one of the following status codes:
GSS_S_COMPLETE Successful completion.
GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT The token did not contain a valid context reference.
GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_TOKEN The token was invalid.
GSS_S_UNAVAILABLE The operation is unavailable.
GSS_S_UNAUTHORIZED Local policy prevents the import of this context by the current process.
GSS_S_FAILURE The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific GSS status code is defined.
The mechanism-specific status code reported by means of the minor_status parameter details the error condition.
