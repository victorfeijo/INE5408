dhcpsvc.conf <-> file containing service configuration parameters for the DHCP service
The dhcpsvc.conf file resides in directory /etc/inet and contains parameters for specifying Dynamic Host Configura<hy>
tion Protocol (DHCP) service configuration settings, including the type and location of DHCP data store used.
The description of the dhcpsvc.conf file in this man page is informational only. The preferred method of setting or
modifying values within the dhcpsvc.conf file is by using dhcpconfig(1M) or the dhcpmgr(1M) utility. Do not edit
the dhcpsvc.conf file.
The dhcpsvc.conf file format is ASCII; comment lines begin with the crosshatch (#) character. Parameters consist
of a keyword followed by an equals (=) sign followed by the parameter value, of the form:
 Keyword=Value
The following Keyword and Value parameters are supported:
BOOTP_COMPAT String. automatic or manual. Enables support of BOOTP clients. Default is no BOOTP. Val<hy>
ue selects BOOTP address allocation method. automatic to support all BOOTP clients, manual to support only reg<hy>
istered BOOTP clients. server mode only parameter.
CACHE_TIMEOUT Integer. Number of seconds the server caches data from data store. Used to improve perfor<hy>
mance. Default is 10 seconds. server mode only parameter.
CONVER Integer. Container version. Used by DHCP administrative tools to identify which version of the public
module is being used to administer the data store. CONVER should not be changed manually.
DAEMON_ENABLED TRUE/FALSE. If TRUE, the DHCP daemon can be run. If FALSE, DHCP daemon
process exits immediately if the daemon is started. Default is TRUE. Generic parameter.
HOSTS_DOMAIN String. Defines name service domain that DHCP administration tools use when managing the
hosts table. Valid only when HOSTS_RESOURCE is set to nisplus or dns.
HOSTS_RESOURCE String. Defines what name service resource should be used by the DHCP administration
tools when managing the hosts table. Current valid values are files, nisplus, and dns.
ICMP_VERIFY TRUE/FALSE. Toggles ICMP echo verification of IP addresses. Default is TRUE. server mode
only parameter.
INTERFACES String. Comma-separated list of interface names to listen to. Generic parameter.
LOGGING_FACILITY Integer. Local facility number (0-7 inclusive) to log DHCP events to. Default is not to log
transactions. Generic parameter.
OFFER_CACHE_TIMEOUT Integer. Number of seconds before OFFER cache timeouts occur. Default is 10 sec<hy>
onds. server mode only parameter.
OWNER_IP String. List of supplemental ownership addresses that will be used by the DHCP server in determining
the dhcp_network records that are under its management. Addresses are in the dotted Internet form of an IPv4 ad<hy>
dress. Primary value is the IP address associated with the system's primary interface (nodename == hostname).
Server-mode-only parameter. Note that using OWNER_IP has some performance impact, thus using a large number
might not be advisable.

PATH Path to DHCP data tables within the data store specified by the RESOURCE parameter. The value of the
PATH keyword is specific to the RESOURCE.
RELAY_DESTINATIONS String. Comma-separated list of host names and/or IP addresses of relay destinations.
relay mode only parameter.
RELAY_HOPS Integer. Max number of BOOTP relay hops before packet is dropped. Default is 4. Generic param<hy>
eter.
RESCAN_INTERVAL Integer. Number of minutes between automatic dhcptab rescans. Default is not to do res<hy>
cans. server mode only parameter.
RESOURCE Data store resource used. Use this parameter to name the public module. See the PATH keyword in
dhcp_modules(5).
RESOURCE_CONFIG String. The private layer provides for module-specific configuration information through
the use of the RESOURCE_CONFIG keyword. See dhcp_modules(5).
Providers can access RESOURCE_CONFIG using the configure function by specifying an optional service
provider layer API function:
 int configure(const char *configp);
If this function is defined by the public module provider, it is called during module load time by the private layer,
with the contents of the RESOURCE_CONFIG string acquired by the administrative interface (in the case of the
dhcpmgr, through the use of a public module-specific java bean extending the dhcpmgr to provide a configuration
dialog for this information.
RUN_MODE server or relay. Selects daemon run mode. Default is server.
SECONDARY_SERVER_TIMEOUT Integer. The number of seconds a secondary server waits for a primary serv<hy>
er to respond before responding itself. Default is 20 seconds. This is a server mode only parameter.
UPDATE_TIMEOUT Integer. Number of seconds to wait for a response from the DNS server before timing out. If
this parameter is present, the DHCP daemon updates DNS on behalf of DHCP clients, and waits the number of sec<hy>
onds specified for a response before timing out. You can use UPDATE_TIMEOUT without specifying a number to
enable DNS updates with the default timeout of 15 seconds. If this parameter is not present, the DHCP daemon does
not update DNS for DHCP clients.
VERBOSE TRUE/FALSE. Toggles verbose mode, determining amount of status and error messages reported by
the daemon. Default is FALSE. Set to TRUE only for debugging. Generic parameter.
