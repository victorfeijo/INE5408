share <-> make local resource available for mounting by remote systems
share [-p] [-F FSType] [-o specific_options] [-d description]
 [pathname]
The share command exports, or makes a resource available for mounting, through a remote file system of type
FSType. If the option -F FSType is omitted, the first file system type listed in /etc/dfs/fstypes is used as default. For a
description of NFS specific options, see share_nfs(1M). pathname is the pathname of the directory to be shared.
When invoked with no arguments, share displays all shared file systems.
-d description
The -d flag may be used to provide a description of the resource being shared.
-F FSType
Specify the filesystem type.
-o specific_options
The specific_options are used to control access of the shared resource. (See share_nfs(1M) for the NFS specific op<hy>
tions.) They may be any of the following:
rw
pathname is shared read/write to all clients. This is also the default behavior.
rw=client[:client]...
pathname is shared read/write only to the listed clients. No other systems can access pathname.
ro
pathname is shared read-only to all clients.
ro=client[:client]...
pathname is shared read-only only to the listed clients. No other systems can access pathname.
Separate multiple options with commas. Separate multiple operands for an option with colons. See EXAMPLES.
-p
Causes the share operation to persist across reboots.
Example 1 Sharing a Read-Only Filesystem
This line will share the /disk file system read-only at boot time.
 share -F nfs -o ro /disk
Example 2 Invoking Multiple Options
The following command shares the filesystem /export/manuals, with members of the netgroup having read-only ac<hy>
cess and users on the specified host having read-write access.
 share -F nfs -o ro=netgroup_name,rw=host1:host2:host3 /export/manuals

/etc/dfs/dfstab
List of share commands to be executed at boot time. Note that you can invoke share from a command line and use
the -p option, described above, as an alternative to editing this file.
/etc/dfs/fstypes
List of file system types; NFS is the default.
/etc/dfs/sharetab
System record of shared file systems.

Export (old terminology): file system sharing used to be called exporting on SunOS 4.x, so the share command used
to be invoked as exportfs(1B) or /usr/sbin/exportfs.
If share commands are invoked multiple times on the same filesystem, the last share invocation supersedes the pre<hy>
vious<em>the options set by the last share command replace the old options. For example, if read-write permission was
given to usera on /somefs, then to give read-write permission also to userb on /somefs:
example% share -F nfs -o rw=usera:userb /somefs
This behavior is not limited to sharing the root filesystem, but applies to all filesystems.
