profiles <-> print execution profiles for a user
profiles [-l] [ user ]...
The profiles command prints on standard output the names of the execution profiles that have been assigned to you
or to the optionally-specified user or role name. Profiles are a bundling mechanism used to enumerate the commands
and authorizations needed to perform a specific function. Along with each listed executable are the process at<hy>
tributes, such as the effective user and group IDs, with which the process runs when started by a privileged com<hy>
mand interpreter. The profile shells are pfcsh, pfksh, and pfexec. See the pfexec(1) man page. Profiles can contain
other profiles defined in prof_attr(4).
Multiple profiles can be combined to construct the appropriate access control. When profiles are assigned, the autho<hy>
rizations are added to the existing set. If the same command appears in multiple profiles, the first occurrence, as de<hy>
termined by the ordering of the profiles, is used for process-attribute settings. For convenience, a wild card can be
specified to match all commands.
When profiles are interpreted, the profile list is loaded from user_attr(4). If any default profile is defined in /etc/se<hy>
curity/policy.conf (see policy.conf(4)), the list of default profiles are added to the list loaded from user_attr(4).
Matching entries in prof_attr(4) provide the authorizations list, and matching entries in exec_attr(4) provide the
commands list.
The following options are supported:
-l Lists the commands in each profile followed by the special process attributes such as user and group IDs.
Example 1 Sample Output
The output of the profiles command has the following form:
 example% profiles tester01 tester02tester01 : Audit Management, All Commands
 tester02 : Device Management, All Commands
