int prefixprint(dev_t dev, char *str);
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI). This entry point is required for block devices.
dev Device number.
str Pointer to a character string describing the problem.
The print() routine is called by the kernel when it has detected an exceptional condition (such as out of space) in the
device. To display the message on the console, the driver should use the cmn_err(9F) kernel function. The driver
should print the message along with any driver specific information.
The print() routine should return 0 for success, or the appropriate error number. The print routine can fail if the
driver implemented a non-standard print() routine that attempted to perform error logging, but was unable to com<hy>
plete the logging for whatever reason.
