Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
The scsi_extended_sense structure for error codes 0x70 (current errors) and 0x71 (deferred errors) is returned on a
successful REQUEST SENSE command. SCSI-2 compliant targets are required to return at least the first 18 bytes
of this structure. This structure is part of scsi_device(9S) structure.

es_valid, if set, indicates that the information field contains valid information.
es_class should be 0x7.
es_code is either 0x0 or 0x1.
es_segnum contains the number of the current segment descriptor if the REQUEST SENSE command is in re<hy>
sponse to a COPY, COMPARE, and COPY AND VERIFY command.
es_filmk, if set, indicates that the current command had read a file mark or set mark (sequential access devices only).
es_eom, if set, indicates that an end-of-medium condition exists (sequential access and printer devices only).
es_ili, if set, indicates that the requested logical block length did not match the logical block length of the data on
the medium.
es_key indicates generic information describing an error or exception condition. The following sense keys are de<hy>
fined:
KEY_NO_SENSE
Indicates that there is no specific sense key information to be reported.
KEY_RECOVERABLE_ERROR
Indicates that the last command completed successfully with some recovery action performed by the target.
KEY_NOT_READY
Indicates that the logical unit addressed cannot be accessed.
KEY_MEDIUM_ERROR
Indicates that the command terminated with a non-recovered error condition that was probably caused by a flaw on
the medium or an error in the recorded data.
<beginning of page>
KEY_HARDWARE_ERROR
Indicates that the target detected a non-recoverable hardware failure while performing the command or during a self
test.
KEY_ILLEGAL_REQUEST
Indicates that there was an illegal parameter in the CDB or in the additional parameters supplied as data for some
commands.
KEY_UNIT_ATTENTION
Indicates that the removable medium might have been changed or the target has been reset.
KEY_WRITE_PROTECT/KEY_DATA_PROTECT
Indicates that a command that reads or writes the medium was attempted on a block that is protected from this oper<hy>
ation.
KEY_BLANK_CHECK
Indicates that a write-once device or a sequential access device encountered blank medium or format-defined end-of-
data indication while reading or a write-once device encountered a non-blank medium while writing.
KEY_VENDOR_UNIQUE
This sense key is available for reporting vendor-specific conditions.
KEY_COPY_ABORTED
Indicates that a COPY, COMPARE, and COPY AND VERIFY command was aborted.
KEY_ABORTED_COMMAND
Indicates that the target aborted the command.
KEY_EQUAL
Indicates that a SEARCH DATA command has satisfied an equal comparison.
KEY_VOLUME_OVERFLOW
Indicates that a buffered peripheral device has reached the end-of-partition and data might remain in the buffer that
has not been written to the medium.
KEY_MISCOMPARE
Indicates that the source data did not match the data read from the medium.
KEY_RESERVE
Indicates that the target is currently reserved by a different initiator.
es_info_{1,2,3,4} is device-type or command specific.
es_add_len indicates the number of additional sense bytes to follow.
<beginning of page>
es_cmd_info contains information that depends on the command that was executed.
es_add_code (ASC) indicates further information related to the error or exception condition reported in the sense
key field.
es_qual_code (ASCQ) indicates detailed information related to the additional sense code.
es_fru_code (FRU) indicates a device-specific mechanism to unit that has failed.
es_skey_specific is defined when the value of the sense-key specific valid bit (bit 7) is 1. This field is reserved for
sense keys not defined above.
