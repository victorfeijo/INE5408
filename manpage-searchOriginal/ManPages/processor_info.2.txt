int processor_info(processorid_t processorid, processor_info_t *infop);
The processor_info() function returns the status of the processor specified by processorid in the processor_info_t
structure pointed to by infop.
The structure processor_info_t contains the following members:
 int pi_state;
 char pi_processor_type[PI_TYPELEN];
 char pi_fputypes[PI_FPUTYPE];
 int pi_clock;
The pi_state member is the current state of the processor, either P_ONLINE, P_OFFLINE, P_NOINTR,
P_FAULTED, P_SPARE, or P_POWEROFF.
The pi_processor_type member is a null-terminated ASCII string specifying the type of the processor.
The pi_fputypes member is a null-terminated ASCII string containing the comma-separated types of floating-point
units (FPUs) attached to the processor. This string will be empty if no FPU is attached.
The pi_clock member is the processor clock frequency rounded to the nearest megahertz. It may be 0 if not known.
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. Otherwise, <mi>1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
The processor_info() function will fail if:
EINVAL An non-existent processor ID was specified.
The caller is in a non-global zone, the pools facility is active, and the processor is not a member of the zone's pool's
processor set.
EFAULT The processor_info_t structure pointed to by infop was not writable by the user.
