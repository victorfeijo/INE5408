lockstat <-> DTrace kernel lock instrumentation provider
The lockstat driver is a DTrace dynamic tracing provider that performs dynamic instrumentation for locking primi<hy>
tives in the Solaris kernel.
The lockstat provider makes probes available that you can use to discern lock contention statistics, or to understand
virtually any aspect of locking behavior inside the operating system kernel. The lockstat(1M) command is imple<hy>
mented as a DTrace consumer that uses the lockstat provider to gather raw data.
The lockstat driver is not a public interface and you access the instrumentation offered by this provider through
DTrace. Refer to the Solaris Dynamic Tracing Guide for a description of the public documented interfaces available
for the DTrace facility and the probes offered by the lockstat provider.
