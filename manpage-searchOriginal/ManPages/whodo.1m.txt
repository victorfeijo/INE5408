whodo <-> who is doing what
/usr/sbin/whodo [-h] [-l] [user]
The whodo command produces formatted and dated output from information in the /var/adm/utmpx and /proc/pid
files.
The display is headed by the date, time, and machine name. For each user logged in, device name, user-ID and login
time is shown, followed by a list of active processes associated with the user-ID. The list includes the device name,
process-ID, CPU minutes and seconds used, and process name.
If user is specified, output is restricted to all sessions pertaining to that user.
The following options are supported:
-h Suppress the heading.
-l Produce a long form of output. The fields displayed are: the user's login name, the name of the tty the user is on,
the time of day the user logged in (in hours:minutes), the idle time <em> that is, the time since the user last typed any<hy>
thing (in hours:minutes), the CPU time used by all processes and their children on that terminal (in minutes:sec<hy>
onds), the CPU time used by the currently active processes (in minutes:seconds), and the name and arguments of the
current process.

If any of the LC_* variables ( LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, LC_TIME, LC_COLLATE, LC_NUMERIC, and
LC_MONETARY ) (see environ(5)) are not set in the environment, the operational behavior of tar(1) for each cor<hy>
responding locale category is determined by the value of the LANG environment variable. If LC_ALL is set, its
contents are used to override both the LANG and the other LC_* variables. If none of the above variables is set in
the environment, the "C" (U.S. style) locale determines how whodo behaves.
LC_CTYPE Determines how whodo handles characters. When LC_CTYPE is set to a valid value, whodo can dis<hy>
play and handle text and filenames containing valid characters for that locale. The whodo command can display and
handle Extended Unix code (EUC) characters where any individual character can be 1, 2, or 3 bytes wide. whodo
can also handle EUC characters of 1, 2, or more column widths. In the "C" locale, only characters from ISO 8859-1
are valid.

LC_MESSAGES Determines how diagnostic and informative messages are presented. This includes the language
and style of the messages, and the correct form of affirmative and negative responses. In the "C" locale, the messages
are presented in the default form found in the program itself (in most cases, U.S. English).
LC_TIME Determines how whodo handles date and time formats. In the "C" locale, date and time handling follow
the U.S. rules.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
non-zero An error occurred.
/etc/passwd System password file
/var/adm/utmpx User access and administration information
/proc/pid Contains PID
