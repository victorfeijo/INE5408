setregid <-> set real and effective group IDs
#include <unistd.h>
int setregid(gid_t rgid, gid_t egid);
The setregid() function is used to set the real and effective group IDs of the calling process. If rgid is <mi>1, the real
group ID is not changed; if egid is <mi>1, the effective group ID is not changed. The real and effective group IDs may
be set to different values in the same call.
If the {PRIV_PROC_SETID} privilege is asserted in the effective set of the calling process, the real group ID and
the effective group ID can be set to any legal value.
If the {PRIV_PROC_SETID} privilege is not asserted in the effective set of the calling process, either the real
group ID can be set to the saved set-group-ID from execve(2), or the effective group ID can either be set to the saved
set-group-ID or the real group ID.
In either case, if the real group ID is being changed (that is, if rgid is not <mi>1), or the effective group ID is being
changed to a value not equal to the real group ID, the saved set-group-ID is set equal to the new effective group ID.
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. Otherwise, <mi>1 is returned, errno is set to indicate the error, and neither of
the group IDs will be changed.
The setregid() function will fail if:
EINVAL The value of rgid or egid is less than 0 or greater than UID_MAX (defined in <limits.h>).
EPERM The {PRIV_PROC_SETID} privilege is not asserted in the effective set of the calling processes and a
change was specified other than changing the real group ID to the saved set-group-ID or changing the effective
group ID to the real group ID or the saved group ID.
If a set-group-ID process sets its effective group ID to its real group ID, it can still set its effective group ID back to
the saved set-group-ID.
