optisa <-> determine which variant instruction set is optimal to use
optisa instruction_set...
optisa prints which instruction_set out of the ones specified in the command will perform best on this machine. In
this case, ``best'' is defined by the order in which instruction set names are returned by isalist(1). Possible values
for instruction_set are given in isalist(5).
See attributes(5) for descriptions of the following attributes:
tab() box; cw(2.75i) |cw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) |lw(2.75i) ATTRIBUTE TYPEATTRIBUTE VALUE _ AvailabilitySUN<hy>

The following exit values are returned:
0 One of the instruction_set values you specified is printed by this command.
1 There is no output; that is, this machine cannot use any instruction_set that you specified with the optisa com<hy>
mand.
isalist(1), uname(1), attributes(5), isalist(5)
optisa is preferable to uname -p or uname -m (see uname(1)) in determining which of several binary versions of a
given program should be used on the given machine.
