kproplog <-> display the contents of the Kerberos principal update log
/usr/sbin/kproplog [-h | -e num]
The kproplog displays the contents of the Kerberos principal update log to standard output. This command can be
used to keep track of the incremental updates to the principal database, which is enabled by default. The
/var/krb5/principal.ulog file contains the update log maintained by the kadmind(1M) process on the master KDC
server and the kpropd(1M) process on the slave KDC servers. When updates occur, they are logged to this file. Sub<hy>
sequently any KDC slave configured for incremental updates will request the current data from the master KDC and
update their principal.ulog file with any updates returned.
The kproplog command can only be run on a KDC server by someone with privileges comparable to the superuser.
It will display update entries for that server only.
If no options are specified, the summary of the update log is displayed. If invoked on the master, all of the update en<hy>
tries are also displayed. When invoked on a slave KDC server, only a summary of the updates are displayed, which
includes the serial number of the last update received and the associated time stamp of the last update.
The following options are supported:
-h Display a summary of the update log. This information includes the database version number, state of the data<hy>
base, the number of updates in the log, the time stamp of the first and last update, and the version number of the first
and last update entry.
-e num Display the last num update entries in the log. This is useful when debugging synchronization between KDC
servers.
-v Display individual attributes per update. An example of the output generated for one entry:
