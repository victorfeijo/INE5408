DAT_RETURN
 dat_rmr_free (
 IN DAT_RMR_HANDLE rmr_handle
 )
rmr_handle Handle for an instance of the RMR to be destroyed.
The dat_rmr_free() function destroys an instance of the RMR.
Use of the handle of the destroyed RMR in any subsequent operation except for the dat_rmr_free() fails. Any re<hy>
mote RDMA operation that uses the destroyed RMR rmr_context, whose Transport-specific request arrived to the lo<hy>
cal host after the dat_rmr_free() has completed, fails and reports a protection violation. Remote RDMA operation
that uses the destroyed RMR rmr_context, whose Transport-specific request arrived to the local host prior to the
dat_rmr_free() return, might or might not complete successfully. If it fails, DAT_DTO_ERR_REMOTE_AC<hy>
CESS is reported in DAT_DTO_COMPLETION_STATUS for the remote RDMA DTO and the connection is bro<hy>
ken.
The dat_rmr_free() function is allowed on either bound or unbound RMR. If RMR is bound, dat_rmr_free() un<hy>
binds (free HCA TPT and other resources and whatever else binds with length of 0 should do), and then free RMR.
DAT_SUCCESS The operation was successful.
DAT_INVALID_HANDLE The rmr_handle handle is invalid.
