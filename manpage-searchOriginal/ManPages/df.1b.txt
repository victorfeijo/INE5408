df <-> display status of disk space on file systems
/usr/ucb/df [-a] [-i] [-t type] [filesystem...]
 [filename...]
The df utility displays the amount of disk space occupied by currently mounted file systems, the amount of used and
available space, and how much of the file system's total capacity has been used.
If arguments to df are path names, df produces a report on the file system containing the named file. Thus `df .'
shows the amount of space on the file system containing the current directory.
The following options are supported:
-a Report on all filesystems including the uninteresting ones which have zero total blocks (that is, auto-mounter).
-i Report the number of used and free inodes. Print ` * ' if no information is available.
-t type Report on filesystems of a given type (for example, nfs or ufs).
Example 1 Using df
A sample of output for df looks like:
 example% df
 Filesystem kbytes used avail capacity Mounted on
 sparky:/ 7445 4714 1986 70% /
 sparky:/usr 42277 35291 2758 93% /usr
Note that used+avail is less than the amount of space in the file system (kbytes); this is because the system reserves
a fraction of the space in the file system to allow its file system allocation routines to work well. The amount re<hy>
served is typically about 10%; this can be adjusted using tunefs (see tunefs(1M)). When all the space on a file sys<hy>
tem except for this reserve is in use, only the super-user can allocate new files and data blocks to existing files. When
a file system is overallocated in this way, df can report that the file system is more than 100% utilized.
