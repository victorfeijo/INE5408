ypinit <-> set up NIS client
/usr/sbin/ypinit [-c] [-m] [-s master_server]
ypinit can be used to set up an NIS client system. You must be the superuser to run this command. This script need
not be used at all if ypbind(1M) is started with the -broadcast option (it is invoked with this option from the
svc:/network/nis/client:default service).
Normally, ypinit is run only once after installing the system. It may be run whenever a new NIS server is added to
the network or an existing one is decommissioned.
ypinit prompts for a list of NIS servers to bind the client to; this list should be ordered from the closest to the fur<hy>
thest server. It is recommended that you list each of these NIS servers by name and numeric IP address in /etc/hosts.
Though the practice is not recommended, NIS allows you to list servers by numeric address only, bypassing
/etc/hosts. In such a configuration, ypwhich(1) returns a numeric address instead of a name.
ypinit stores the list of servers to which a client can bind in the file /var/yp/binding/domain/ypservers. This file is
used by ypbind when run without the -broadcast option.
-c
Set up a ypclient system.
-m
Build a master ypserver data base.
-s master_server
Slave data base. master_server must be the same master configured in the YP maps and returned by the ypwhich -m
command.
/etc/hosts
File in which it is recommended that NIS servers be listed.
/var/yp/binding/domain/ypservers
Lists the servers to which the NIS client is allowed to bind.

The NIS client service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/network/nis/client:default
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). The service's status can be queried using the svcs(1) command.
ypinit sets up the list of NIS servers only for the current domain on the system when it is run, that is, the domain re<hy>
turned by the SI_SRPC_DOMAIN command to sysinfo(2). Care should be taken to ensure that this is the same as
the desired domain for NIS client processes.
