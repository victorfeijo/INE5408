getq <-> get the next message from a queue
#include <sys/stream.h>
mblk_t *getq(queue_t *q);
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI).
q Pointer to the queue from which the message is to be retrieved.
The getq() function is used by a service ( srv(9E)) routine to retrieve its enqueued messages.
A module or driver may include a service routine to process enqueued messages. Once the STREAMS scheduler
calls srv() it must process all enqueued messages, unless prevented by flow control. getq() obtains the next available
message from the top of the queue pointed to by q. It should be called in a while loop that is exited only when there
are no more messages or flow control prevents further processing.
If an attempt was made to write to the queue while it was blocked by flow control, getq() back-enables (restarts) the
service routine once it falls below the low water mark.
If there is a message to retrieve, getq() returns a pointer to it. If no message is queued, getq() returns a NULL point<hy>
er.
The getq() function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context.
