int volmgt_ownspath(char *path);
path A string containing the path.
This function is obsolete. The management of removable media by the Volume Management feature, including vold,
has been replaced by software that supports the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). Programmatic support for HAL
is through the HAL APIs, which are documented on the HAL web site. See hal(5). The return value of this function
is undefined.
The volmgt_ownspath() function checks to see if a given path is contained in the volume management name space.
This is achieved by comparing the beginning of the supplied path name with the output from
volmgt_root(3VOLMGT)
The return from this function is undefined. Example 1 Using volmgt_ownspath()
The following example first checks if volume management is running, then checks the volume management name
space for path, and then returns the id for the piece of media.
 char *path;
 ...
 if (volmgt_running()) {
  if (volmgt_ownspath(path)) {
  (void) printf("id of %s is %lld\n",
  path, media_getid(path));
  }
 }
