The stclient command displays, finds, adds, updates and deletes records in the Service Tag registry. The registry is
in the XML file /var/sadm/servicetag/registry/servicetag.xml, and contains the inventory of the product instances
installed in the machine. Each record has a unique product instance identifier which is generated when the service
tag is added in the registry. This product instance identifier is used as a key when finding, updating or deleting the
service tag records. The extract option prints out the registry contents in XML format in stdout.
The stclient command also runs in interactive mode. This mode is invoked by running stclient without any parame<hy>
ters. A menu of all the available options are displayed, and the user is prompted to enter different parameters de<hy>
pending on the option chosen.
Any user can extract or get the contents of the registry, but only users with the appropriate privileges, the "svctag"
user, or the creator of the service tag is authorized to update or delete a service tag record.
The following options are supported:
-p product_name
Sets the product name of the service tag to be added. For example, "stclient -p "Solaris 10 Operating System"" sets
the product name to the "Solaris 10 Operating System".
-e product_version
Sets the product version of the service tag to be added. For example, "stclient -r 5.10" sets the product version to
"5.10".
-t product_URN
Sets the Sun product unique identifier of the service tag to be added. For example, "stclient -t
urn:uuid:5005588c-36f3-11d6-9cec-fc96f718e113" sets the Sun product unique identifier to
"urn:uuid:5005588c-36f3-11d6-9cec-fc96f718e113".
-i instance_URN
Sets the product instance unique identifier of the service tag. For example, "stclient -i
3a444ab2-1dd2-11b2-a69d-830020782a6b" sets the product instance unique identifier to
"3a444ab2-1dd2-11b2-a69d-830020782a6b" This field may also be set when the service tag is added but is not typi<hy>
cally used. The generation of the instance ID is normally left to the stclient.
-F product_parent_URN
Sets the Sun product unique identifier of parent product. For example, "stclient -F
urn:uuid:5005588c-36f3-11d6-9cec-fc96f718e113" sets the Sun product unique identifier of parent product to
<beginning of page>
"urn:uuid:5005588c-36f3-11d6-9cec-fc96f718e113".
-P product_parent
Sets the parent product of the service tag. For example, "stclient -P JES" sets the product parent to "JES".
-I product_defined_instance_id
Sets the product defined instance identifier. For example, "stclient -I ser:abc-klm-000-7190" sets the product defined
instance identifier to "ser:abc-klm-000-7190".
-m product_vendor
Sets the vendor of the product. For example, "stclient -m Sun" sets the product vendor to "Sun".
-A platform_arch
Sets the platform architecture that the product is running on. For example, "stclient -A sparc" sets the platform archi<hy>
tecture to "sparc"
-z container
Sets the container that the product is running on. For example, "stclient -z "global zone"" sets the container to "glob<hy>
al zone".
-S source
Sets the source of this service tag, naming the entity that created it.
-r root_dir
Sets the root directory where the command searches for the registry. The command searches /var/sadm/servic<hy>
etag/registry by default. When this option is used, the command looks for the Registry in the specified root directo<hy>
ry, (for example, "-r /home/user1" searches /home/user1/var/sadm/servicetag). This is typically used for testing.
The function portion of the key is specified by one of the following letters:
x Extract. Extracts and prints the contents of the Service Tag registry in XML format. An alternate root directory
may be specified for testing purposes.
a Add. Adds a service tag in the registry. A unique product instance identifier may be supplied and is automatically
generated if not provided. This field is returned by the command. The required fields for add are product name,
product version, product URN, product parent, vendor, platform architecture, container and source.
u Update. Updates a service tag in the registry using the product instance URN as the key. The parent URN and
product defined instance id fields can be updated.
d Delete. Deletes a service tag in the registry using the product instance URN as the key.
E Extract Environment. Enumerates to standard output the environmental or "agent"' information associated with
the registered Service Tags on this system.
g Get. Gets and prints a service tag from the registry using the product instance URN as the key.
<beginning of page>
f Find. Finds and prints all the instance URNs of a given product URN.
h Help. Displays the command options.
v Version. Displays the version number of the command.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
> 0 An error occurred.
Example 1 Adding a Service Tag in the Registry
To add a service tag, enter the following:
 # stclient -a -p "Java Enterprise Web Server 6.0" -e 6.0 \
  -t urn:uuid:f2b8b59c-6eba-11d7-986f-9f5d47ec72fe \
  -P Java Enterprise Server -m Sun -A sparc -z global -S patch
The screen displays the following:
 Java Enterprise Web Server 6.0 6.0 added
 Product instance URN=urn:st:7fc61914-1dd2-11b2-b992-830020782a6b
Example 2 Updating a Service Tag in the Registry
To update a service tag, enter the following:
 # stclient -u -i 7fc61914-1dd2-11b2-b992-830020782a6b \
  -I urn:st:product.defined.id
The screen displays the following:
 Service tag updated
Example 3 Extracting a Service Tag Registry
To extract a service tag, enter the following:
 # stclient -x
The screen displays output similar to the following:
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 <registry urn="urn:uuid:1234ab-00e1-11b3-98737646873" version="1.0">
  <service_tag>
  .
  .
<beginning of page>
  .
  </service_tag>
  </registry>
Example 4 Finding all product instances
To find all product instances, enter the following:
 # stclient -f -t urn:uuid:f2b8b59c-6eba-11d7-986f-9f5d47ec72fe \
  fc61914-1dd2-11b2-b992-830020782a6b
Example 5 Listing the Environmental Information
To list the environmental information associated with the registered Service Tags on this system, enter the following:
 # stclient -E
The screen displays output similar to the following:
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 <agent>
  <agent_urn>urn:st:af15ee62-0bb3-ef2d-fa96-85a11996cc71</agent_urn>
  .
  .
  .
  </system_info>
