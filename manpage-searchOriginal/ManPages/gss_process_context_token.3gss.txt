OM_uint32 gss_process_context_token(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
 const gss_ctx_id_t context_handle,const gss_buffer_t token_buffer);
The gss_process_context_token() function provides a way to pass an asynchronous token to the security service.
Most context-level tokens are emitted and processed synchronously by gss_init_sec_context() and gss_ac<hy>
cept_sec_context(), and the application is informed as to whether further tokens are expected by the GSS_C_CON<hy>
TINUE_NEEDED major status bit. Occasionally, a mechanism might need to emit a context-level token at a point
when the peer entity is not expecting a token. For example, the initiator's final call to gss_init_sec_context() may
emit a token and return a status of GSS_S_COMPLETE, but the acceptor's call to gss_accept_sec_context() might
fail. The acceptor's mechanism might want to send a token containing an error indication to the initiator, but the ini<hy>
tiator is not expecting a token at this point, believing that the context is fully established. gss_process_context_to<hy>
ken() provides a way to pass such a token to the mechanism at any time.
This function is provided for compatibility with the GSS-API version 1. Because gss_delete_sec_context() no
longer returns a valid output_token to be sent to gss_process_context_token(), applications using a newer version of
the GSS-API do not need to rely on this function.
The parameter descriptions for gss_process_context_token() are as follows:
minor_status A mechanism-specific status code.
context_handle Context handle of context on which token is to be processed.
token_buffer Token to process.
gss_process_context_token() returns one of the following status codes:
GSS_S_COMPLETE Successful completion.
GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_TOKEN Indicates that consistency checks performed on the token failed.
GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT The context_handle did not refer to a valid context.
GSS_S_FAILURE The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific GSS status code is defined.
The mechanism-specific status code reported by means of the minor_status parameter details the error condition.
