sag <-> system activity graph
sag [-e time] [-f file] [-i sec] [-s time] [-T term]
 [-x spec] [-y spec]
The sag utility graphically displays the system activity data stored in a binary data file by a previous sar(1) run. Any
of the sar data items may be plotted singly or in combination, as cross plots or versus time. Simple arithmetic com<hy>
binations of data may be specified. sag invokes sar and finds the desired data by string-matching the data column
header (run sar to see what is available). The sag utility requires a graphic terminal to draw the graph, and uses
tplot(1) to produce its output. When running Solaris 2.x and OpenWindows, perform the following steps: 1. Run an
xterm as a Tektronics terminal: prompt# xterm -t 2. In the xterm window, run sag specifying a tek terminal:
prompt# sag -T tek options
The following options are supported and passed through to sar (see sar(1)):
-e time Select data up to time. Default is 18:00.
-f file Use file as the data source for sar. Default is the current daily data file /usr/adm/sa/sadd.
-i sec Select data at intervals as close as possible to sec seconds.
-s time Select data later than time in the form hh[:mm]. Default is 08:00.
-T term Produce output suitable for terminal term. See tplot(1) for known terminals. Default for term is $TERM.
-x spec x axis specification with spec in the form:
name[op name]...[lo hi]
name is either a string that will match a column header in the sar report, with an optional device name in square
brackets, for example, r+w/s[dsk<mi>1], or an integer value. op is + <mi> * or / surrounded by blank spaces. Up to five
names may be specified. Parentheses are not recognized. Contrary to custom, + and - have precedence over * and /.
Evaluation is left to right. Thus, A/A+B*100 is evaluated as (A/(A+B))*100, and A+B/C+D is (A+B)/(C+D). lo and
hi are optional numeric scale limits. If unspecified, they are deduced from the data.
Enclose spec in double-quotes ("") if it includes white space.
A single spec is permitted for the x axis. If unspecified, time is used.
-y spec y axis specification with spec in the same form as for -x. Up to 5 spec arguments separated by a semi-colon
(;) may be given for -y. The -y default is:
-y"%usr0100;%usr+%sys0100;%usr+%sys+%wio0100"
Example 1 Examples of the sag command.
To see today's CPU utilization:
 example$ sag
To see activity over 15 minutes of all disk drives:
 example$ TS=`date +%H:%M`
 example$ sar -o /tmp/tempfile 60 15
 example$ TE=`date +%H:%M`
 example$ sag -f /tmp/tempfile -s $TS -e $TE -y "r+w/s[dsk]"
