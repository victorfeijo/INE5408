dpost translates files created by troff(1) into PostScript and writes the results on the standard output. If no files are
specified, or if <mi> is one of the input files, the standard input is read.
The files should be prepared by troff. The default font files in /usr/lib/font/devpost produce the best and most effi<hy>
cient output. They assume a resolution of 720 dpi, and can be used to format files by adding the -Tpost option to the
troff call. Older versions of the eqn and pic preprocessors need to know the resolution that troff will be using to for<hy>
mat the files. If those are the versions installed on your system, use the -r720 option with eqn and -T720 with pic.
dpost makes no assumptions about resolutions. The first x res command sets the resolution used to translate the in<hy>
put files, the DESC.out file, usually /usr/lib/font/devpost/DESC.out, defines the resolution used in the binary font
files, and the PostScript prologue is responsible for setting up an appropriate user coordinate system.
-c num Print num copies of each page. By default only one copy is printed.
-e num Sets the text encoding level to num. The recognized choices are 0, 1, and 2. The size of the output file and
print time should decrease as num increases. Level 2 encoding will typically be about 20 percent faster than level 0,
which is the default and produces output essentially identical to previous versions of dpost.
-m num Magnify each logical page by the factor num. Pages are scaled uniformly about the origin, which is located
near the upper left corner of each page. The default magnification is 1.0.
-n num Print num logical pages on each piece of paper, where num can be any positive integer. By default, num is set
to 1.
-o list Print those pages for which numbers are given in the comma-separated list. The list contains single numbers N
and ranges N1<mi>N2. A missing N1 means the lowest numbered page, a missing N2 means the highest. The page range
is an expression of logical pages rather than physical sheets of paper. For example, if you are printing two logical
pages to a sheet, and you specified a range of 4, then two sheets of paper would print, containing four page layouts.
If you specified a page range of 3-4, when requesting two logical pages to a sheet; then only page 3 and page 4 lay<hy>
outs would print, and they would appear on one physical sheet of paper.
-p mode Print files in either portrait or landscape mode. Only the first character of mode is significant. The default
mode is portrait.
-w num Set the line width used to implement troff graphics commands to num points, where a point is approximate<hy>
ly 1/72 of an inch. By default, num is set to 0.3 points.
-x num Translate the origin num inches along the positive x axis. The default coordinate system has the origin fixed
near the upper left corner of the page, with positive x to the right and positive y down the page. Positive num moves
everything right. The default offset is 0 inches.
-y num Translate the origin num inches along the positive y axis. Positive num moves text up the page. The default
offset is 0.
-F dir Use dir as the font directory. The default dir is /usr/lib/font, and dpost reads binary font files from directory
/usr/lib/font/devpost.
<beginning of page>
-H dir Use dir as the host resident font directory. Files in this directory should be complete PostScript font descrip<hy>
tions, and must be assigned a name that corresponds to the appropriate two-character troff font name. Each font file
is copied to the output file only when needed and at most once during each job. There is no default directory.
-L file Use file as the PostScript prologue which, by default, is /usr/lib/lp/postscript/dpost.ps.
-O Disables PostScript picture inclusion. A recommended option when dpost is run by a spooler in a networked en<hy>
vironment.
-T name Use font files for device name as the best description of available PostScript fonts. By default, name is set
to post and dpost reads binary files from /usr/lib/font/devpost.
Example 1 Examples of the dpost command.
If the old versions of eqn and pic are installed on your system, you can obtain the best possible looking output by is<hy>
suing a command line such as the following:
 example% pic -T720 file | tbl | eqn -r720 | troff -mm -Tpost | dpost
Otherwise,
 example% pic file | tbl | eqn | troff -mm -Tpost | dpost
should give the best results.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
non-zero An error occurred.

Output files often do not conform to Adobe's file structuring conventions. Piping the output of dpost through
postreverse(1) should produce a minimally conforming PostScript file.
Although dpost can handle files formatted for any device, emulation is expensive and can easily double the print
time and the size of the output file. No attempt has been made to implement the character sets or fonts available on
all devices supported by troff. Missing characters will be replaced by white space, and unrecognized fonts will usu<hy>
ally default to one of the Times fonts (that is, R, I, B, or BI).
An x res command must precede the first x init command, and all the input files should have been prepared for the
same output device.
Use of the -T option is not encouraged. Its only purpose is to enable the use of other PostScript font and device de<hy>
scription files, that perhaps use different resolutions, character sets, or fonts.
Although level 0 encoding is the only scheme that has been thoroughly tested, level 2 is fast and may be worth a try.
