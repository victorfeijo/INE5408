 dat_srq_free (
 IN DAT_SRQ_HANDLE srq_handle
 )
srq_handle A handle for an instance of SRQ to be destroyed.
The dat_srq_free() function destroys an instance of the SRQ. The SRQ cannot be destroyed if it is in use by an EP.
It is illegal to use the destroyed handle in any consequent operation.
DAT_SUCCESS The operation was successful.
DAT_INVALID_HANDLE The srq_handle argument is an invalid DAT handle.
DAT_SRQ_IN_USE The Shared Receive Queue can not be destroyed because it is in still associated with an EP in<hy>
stance.
If the Provider detects the use of a deleted object handle, it should return DAT_INVALID_HANDLE. The Provider
should avoid assigning the used handle as long as possible. Once reassigned the handle is no longer a handle of a de<hy>
stroyed object.
