The mlib_SignalLPCCovariance_F32() function performs linear predictive coding with covariance method.
In linear predictive coding (LPC) model, each speech sample is represented as a linear combination of the past M
samples.
   M
  s(n) = SUM a(i) * s(n-i) + G * u(n)
   i=1
where s(*) is the speech signal, u(*) is the excitation signal, and G is the gain constants, M is the order of the linear
prediction filter. Given s(*), the goal is to find a set of coefficient a(*) that minimizes the prediction error e(*).
   M
  e(n) = s(n) - SUM a(i) * s(n-i)
   i=1
In covariance method, the coefficients can be obtained by solving following set of linear equations.
   M
  SUM a(i) * c(i,k) = c(0,k), k=1,...,M
  i=1
where
   N-k-1
  c(i,k) = SUM s(j) * s(j+k-i)
   j=0
are the covariance coefficients of s(*), N is the length of the input speech vector.
Note that the covariance matrix R is a symmetric matrix, and the equations can be solved efficiently with Cholesky
decomposition method.

The function takes the following arguments:
coeff The linear prediction coefficients.
signal The input signal vector.
state Pointer to the internal state structure.
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
