swab <-> swap bytes in 16-bit halfwords
#include <sys/sunddi.h>
void swab(void *src, void *dst, size_t nbytes);
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI).
src A pointer to the buffer containing the bytes to be swapped.
dst A pointer to the destination buffer where the swapped bytes will be written. If dst is the same as src the buffer
will be swapped in place.
nbytes Number of bytes to be swapped, rounded down to the nearest half-word.
The swab() function copies the bytes in the buffer pointed to by src to the buffer pointer to by dst, swapping the or<hy>
der of adjacent bytes in half-word pairs as the copy proceeds. A total of nbytes bytes are copied, rounded down to
the nearest half-word.
The swab() function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context.
Writing Device Drivers
Since swab() operates byte-by-byte, it can be used on non-aligned buffers.
