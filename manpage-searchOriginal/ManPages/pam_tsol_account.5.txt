pam_tsol_account <-> PAM account management module for Trusted Extensions
/usr/lib/security/pam_tsol_account.so.1
The Solaris Trusted Extensions service module for PAM, /usr/lib/security/pam_tsol_account.so.1, checks account
limitations that are related to labels. The pam_tsol_account.so.1 module is a shared object that can be dynamically
loaded to provide the necessary functionality upon demand. Its path is specified in the PAM configuration file.
pam_tsol_account.so.1 contains a function to perform account management, pam_sm_acct_mgmt(). The function
checks for the allowed label range for the user. The allowable label range is set by the defaults in the label_encod<hy>
ings(4) file. These defaults can be overridden by entries in the user_attr(4) database.
By default, this module requires that remote hosts connecting to the global zone must have a CIPSO host type. To
disable this policy, add the allow_unlabeled keyword as an option to the entry in pam.conf(4), as in:
 other account required pam_tsol_account allow_unlabeled
The following options can be passed to the module:
allow_unlabeled Allows remote connections from hosts with unlabeled template types.
debug Provides debugging information at the LOG_DEBUG level. See syslog(3C).
The following values are returned:
PAM_SUCCESS The account is valid for use at this time and label.
PAM_PERM_DENIED The current process label is outside the user's label range, or the label information for the
process is unavailable, or the remote host type is not valid.
Other values Returns an error code that is consistent with typical PAM operations. For information on error-related
return values, see the pam(3PAM) man page.
