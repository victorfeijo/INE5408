int pam_setcred(pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags);
The pam_setcred() function is used to establish, modify, or delete user credentials. It is typically called after the us<hy>
er has been authenticated and after a session has been validated. See pam_authenticate(3PAM) and pam_ac<hy>
ct_mgmt(3PAM).
The user is specified by a prior call to pam_start() or pam_set_item(), and is referenced by the authentication han<hy>
dle, pamh. The following flags may be set in the flags field. Note that the first four flags are mutually exclusive:
PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED Set user credentials for an authentication service.
PAM_DELETE_CRED Delete user credentials associated with an authentication service.
PAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED Reinitialize user credentials.
PAM_REFRESH_CRED Extend lifetime of user credentials.
PAM_SILENT Authentication service should not generate any messages.
If no flag is set, PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED is used as the default.
Upon success, pam_setcred() returns PAM_SUCCESS. In addition to the error return values described in
pam(3PAM) the following values may be returned upon error:
PAM_CRED_UNAVAIL Underlying authentication service can not retrieve user credentials unavailable.
PAM_CRED_EXPIRED User credentials expired.
PAM_USER_UNKNOWN User unknown to underlying authentication service.
PAM_CRED_ERR Failure setting user credentials.
