label_to_str() is a simple function to convert various mandatory label types to human readable strings.
label is the mandatory label to convert. string points to memory that is allocated by label_to_str() that contains the
converted string. The caller is responsible for calling free(3C) to free allocated memory.
The calling process must have mandatory read access to the resulting human readable string. Or the calling process
must have the sys_trans_label privilege.
The conversion_type parameter controls the type of label conversion. Not all types of conversion are valid for all
types of label:
M_LABEL Converts label to a human readable string based on its type.
M_INTERNAL Converts label to an internal text representation that is safe for storing in a public object. Internal
conversions can later be parsed to their same value.
M_COLOR Converts label to a string that represents the color name that the administrator has associated with the
label.
PRINTER_TOP_BOTTOM Converts label to a human readable string that is appropriate for use as the top and
bottom label of banner and trailer pages in the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) encodings printed output schema.
PRINTER_LABEL Converts label to a human readable string that is appropriate for use as the banner page down<hy>
grade warning in the DIA encodings printed output schema.
PRINTER_CAVEATS Converts label to a human readable string that is appropriate for use as the banner page
caveats section in the DIA encodings printed output schema.
PRINTER_CHANNELS Converts label to a human readable string that is appropriate for use as the banner page
handling channels in the DIA encodings printed output schema.
The flags parameter provides a hint to the label conversion:
DEF_NAMES The default names are preferred.
SHORT_NAMES Short names are preferred where defined.
LONG_NAMES Long names are preferred.
Upon successful completion, the label_to_str() function returns 0. Otherwise, -1 is returned, errno is set to indicate
the error and the string pointer is set to NULL.
The label_to_str() function will fail if:
EINVAL Invalid parameter.

ENOTSUP The system does not support label translations.
ENOMEM The physical limits of the system are exceeded by size bytes of memory which cannot be allocated.

The label_to_str() function is Committed. The returned string is Not-an-Interface and is dependent on the specific
label_encodings file. The conversion type INTERNAL is Uncommitted, but is always accepted as input to
str_to_label(3TSOL).
Conversion types that are relative to the DIA encodings schema are Standard. Standard is specified in label_encod<hy>
ings(4).

Using the label_to_str Function in Solaris Trusted Extensions Developer's Guide
A number of these conversions rely on the DIA label encodings schema. They might not be valid for other label
schemata.
The functionality described on this manual page is available only if the system is configured with Trusted Exten<hy>
sions.
