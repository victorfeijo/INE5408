dsvclockd <-> DHCP service lock daemon
/usr/lib/inet/dsvclockd [-d 1 | 2] [-f ] [-v]
The dsvclockd daemon is a lock manager that works in conjunction with the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
(DHCP) Data Service Library (libdhcpsvc). It provides shared or exclusive access to the dhcp_network(4) and
dhcptab(4) tables. This service is used by the SUNWbinfiles and SUNWfiles DHCP data store modules. See
dhcp_modules(5).
dsvclockd is started on demand by libdhcpsvc. The dsvclockd daemon should be started manually only if com<hy>
mand line options need to be specified.
The following options are supported:
-d 1 | 2 Set debug level. Two levels of debugging are currently available, 1 and 2. Level 2 is more verbose.
-f Run in the foreground instead of as a daemon process. When this option is used, messages are sent to standard er<hy>
ror instead of to syslog(3C).
-v Provide verbose output.
