OM_uint32 gss_compare_name(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
 const gss_name_t name1,const gss_name_t name2,
 int *name_equal);
The gss_compare_name() function allows an application to compare two internal-form names to determine whether
they refer to the same entity.
If either name presented to gss_compare_name() denotes an anonymous principal, the routines indicate that the two
names do not refer to the same identity.
The parameter descriptions for gss_compare_name() follow:
minor_status Mechanism-specific status code.
name1 Internal-form name.
name2 Internal-form name.
name_equal If non-zero, the names refer to same entity. If 0, the names refer to different entities. Strictly, the names
are not known to refer to the same identity.
The gss_compare_name() function may return the following status codes:
GSS_S_COMPLETE Successful completion.
GSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE The two names were of incomparable types.
GSS_S_BAD_NAME One or both of name1 or name2 was ill-formed.
GSS_S_FAILURE The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific GSS status code is defined.
The mechanism-specific status code reported by means of the minor_status parameter details the error condition.
