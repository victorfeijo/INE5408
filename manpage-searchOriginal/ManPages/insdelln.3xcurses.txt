int insdelln(int n);
int winsdelln(WINDOW *win, int n);
n Is the number of lines to insert or delete (positive n inserts; negative n deletes).
win Is a pointer to the window in which to insert or delete a line.
The insdelln() and winsdelln() functions insert or delete blank lines in stdscr or win, respectively. When n is posi<hy>
tive, n lines are added before the current line and the bottom n lines are lost; when n is negative, n lines are deleted
starting with the current line, the remaining lines are moved up, and the bottom n lines are cleared. The position of
the cursor does not change.
On success, these functions return OK. Otherwise, they return ERR.
None.
