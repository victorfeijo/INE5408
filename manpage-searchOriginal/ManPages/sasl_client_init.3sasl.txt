int sasl_client_init(const sasl_callback_t *callbacks);
Use the sasl_client_init() interface to initialize SASL. The sasl_client_init() interface must be called before any
calls to sasl_client_start(3SASL). The call to sasl_client_init() initiallizes all SASL client drivers, for example, au<hy>
thentication mechanisms. SASL client drivers are usually found in the /usr/lib/sasl directory.
callbacks Specifies the base callbacks for all client connections.
sasl_client_init() returns an integer that corresponds to a SASL error code.
SASL_OK The call to sasl_client_init() was successful.
SASL_BADVERS There is a mismatch in the mechanism version.
SASL_BADPARAM There is an error in the configuration file.
SASL_NOMEM There is not enough memory to complete the operation.
All other error codes indicate an error situation that must be handled, or the authentication session should be quit.
See sasl_errors(3SASL) for information on SASL error codes.

While most of libsasl is MT-Safe, no other libsasl function should be called until this function completes.
