rpc.yppasswdd is a server that handles password change requests from yppasswd(1). It changes a password entry in
the passwd, shadow, and security/passwd.adjunct files. The passwd and shadow files provide the basis for the
passwd.byname and passwd.byuid maps. The passwd.adjunct file provides the basis for the passwd.adjunct.by<hy>
name and passwd.adjunct.byuid maps. Entries in the passwd, shadow or passwd.adjunct files are changed only if
the password presented by yppasswd(1) matches the encrypted password of the entry. All password files are located
in the PWDIR directory.
If the -D option is given, the passwd, shadow, or passwd.adjunct files are placed under the directory path that is the
argument to -D.
If the -noshell, -nogecos or -nopw options are given, these fields cannot be changed remotely using chfn, chsh, or
passwd(1).
If the -m option is given, a make(1S) is performed in /var/yp after any of the passwd, shadow, or passwd.adjunct
files are modified. All arguments following the flag are passed to make.
The second of the listed syntaxes is provided only for backward compatibility. If the second syntax is used, the pass<hy>
wordfile is the full pathname of the password file and adjunctfile is the full pathname of the optional passwd.ad<hy>
junct file. If a shadow file is found in the same directory as passwordfile, the shadowfile is used as described above.
Use of this syntax and the discovery of a shadowfile file generates diagnostic output. The daemon, however, starts
normally.
The first and second syntaxes are mutually exclusive. You cannot specify the full pathname of the passwd, pass<hy>
wd.adjunct files and use the -D option at the same time.
The daemon is started automatically on the master server of the passwd map by ypstart(1M), which is invoked at
boot time by the svcs:/network/nis/server:default service.
The server does not insist on the presence of a shadow file unless there is no -D option present or the directory
named with the -D option is /etc. In addition, a passwd.adjunct file is not necessary. If the -D option is given, the
server attempts to find a passwd.adjunct file in the security subdirectory of the named directory. For example, in
the presence of -D /var/yp the server checks for a /var/yp/security/passwd.adjunct file.
If only a passwd file exists, then the encrypted password is expected in the second field. If both a passwd and a
passwd.adjunct file exist, the encrypted password is expected in the second field of the adjunct file with ##user<hy>
name in the second field of the passwd file. If all three files are in use, the encrypted password is expected in the
shadow file. Any deviation causes a password update to fail.
If you remove or add a shadow or passwd.adjunct file after rpc.yppasswdd has started, you must stop and restart
the daemon to enable it to recognize the change. See ypstart(1m) for information on restarting the daemon.
The rpc.yppasswdd daemon considers a shell that has a name that begins with 'r' to be a restricted shell. By default,
the daemon does not check whether a shell begins with an 'r'. However, you can tell it to do so by uncommenting
the check_restricted_shell_name=1 line in /etc/default/yppasswdd. The result will be to restrict a user's ability to
change from his default shell. See yppasswdd(4).
On start up, yppasswdd checks for the existence of a NIS to LDAP (N2L) configuration file,
/var/yp/NISLDAPmapping. If the configuration file is present, the daemon runs in N2L mode. If the file is not
present, yppasswdd runs in traditional, non-N2L mode.
In N2L mode, changes are written directly to the Directory Information Tree (DIT). If the changes are written suc<hy>
cessfully, the NIS map is updated. The NIS source files, passwd, shadow, and passwd.adjunct, for example, are not
updated. Thus, in N2L mode, the -D option is meaningless. In N2L mode, yppasswdd propagates changes by call<hy>
ing yppush(1M) instead of ypmake(1M). The -m option is thus unused.

During an NIS-to-LDAP transition, the yppasswdd daemon uses the N2L-specific map, ageing.byname, to read
and write password aging information to the DIT. If you are not using password aging, then the ageing.byname
mapping is ignored.

If make has not been installed and the -m option is given, the daemon outputs a warning and proceeds, effectively
ignoring the -m flag.
When using the -D option, you should make sure that the PWDIR of the /var/yp/Makefile is set accordingly.
The second listed syntax is supplied only for backward compatibility and might be removed in a future release of
this daemon.
The Network Information Service (NIS) was formerly known as Sun Yellow Pages (YP). The functionality of the
two remains the same; only the name has changed. The name Yellow Pages is a registered trademark in the United
Kingdom of British Telecommunications PLC, and cannot be used without permission.
The NIS server service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svcs:/network/nis/server:default
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). The service's status can be queried using the svcs(1) command.
