pset_getloadavg <-> get system load averages for a processor set
#include <sys/pset.h>
#include <sys/loadavg.h>
int pset_getloadavg(psetid_t pset, double loadavg[], int nelem);
The pset_getloadavg() function returns the number of processes assigned to the specified processor set that are in
the system run queue, averaged over various periods of time. Up to nelem samples are retrieved and assigned to suc<hy>
cessive elements of loadavg[]. The system imposes a maximum of 3 samples, representing averages over the last 1,
5, and 15 minutes, respectively.
The LOADAVG_1MIN, LOADAVG_5MIN, and LOADAVG_15MIN indices, defined in <sys/loadavg.h>, can be
used to extract the data from the appropriate element of the loadavg[] array.
If pset is PS_NONE, the load average for processes not assigned to a processor set is returned.
If pset is PS_MYID, the load average for the processor set to which the caller is bound is returned. If the caller is
not bound to a processor set, the result is the same as if PS_NONE was specified.
Upon successful completion, the number of samples actually retrieved is returned. If the load average was unobtain<hy>
able or the processor set does not exist, <mi>1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
The pset_getloadavg() function will fail if:
EINVAL The number of elements specified is less than 0, or an invalid processor set ID was specified.
The caller is in a non-global zone, the pools facility is active, and the specified processor set is not that of the zone's
pool.
