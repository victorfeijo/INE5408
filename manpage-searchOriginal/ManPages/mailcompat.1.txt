mailcompat <-> provide SunOS compatibility for Solaris mailbox format
mailcompat is a program to provide SunOS 4.x compatability for the Solaris mailbox format. You would typically
run mailcompat to be able to read mail on a workstation running SunOS 4.x when your mail server is running So<hy>
laris.
Enabling mailcompat creates an entry in your .forward file, if it exists. If this file does not exist, mailcompat will
create it. Disabling mailcompat will remove the entry from the .forward file, and if this was the only entry, will re<hy>
move the entire file.
To execute mailcompat, log onto the Solaris mail server and enter mailcompat on the command line. Answer the
queries provided by the program.
See largefile(5) for the description of the behavior of mailcompat when encountering files greater than or equal to 2
Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes). Example 1 Examples of the mailcompat feature.
