int pthread_spin_unlock(pthread_spinlock_t *lock);
The pthread_spin_unlock() function releases the spin lock referenced by lock which was locked with the
pthread_spin_lock(3C) or pthread_spin_trylock(3C) functions. The results are undefined if the lock is not held by
the calling thread. If there are threads spinning on the lock when pthread_spin_unlock() is called, the lock becomes
available and an unspecified spinning thread acquires the lock.
The results are undefined if this function is called with an uninitialized thread spin lock.
Upon successful completion, the pthread_spin_unlock() function returns 0. Otherwise, an error number shall be re<hy>
turned to indicate the error.
The pthread_spin_unlock() function will fail if:
EINVAL An invalid argument was specified.
EPERM The calling thread does not hold the lock.
