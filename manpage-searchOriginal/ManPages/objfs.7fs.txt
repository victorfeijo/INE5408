objfs <-> Kernel object filesystem
The objfs filesystem describes the state of all modules currently loaded by the kernel. It is mounted during boot at
/system/object.
The contents of the filesystem are dynamic and reflect the current state of the system. Each module is represented by
a directory containing a single file, 'object.' The object file is a read only ELF file which contains information about
the object loaded in the kernel.
The kernel may load and unload modules dynamically as the system runs. As a result, applications may observe dif<hy>
ferent directory contents in /system/object if they repeatedly rescan the directory. If a module is unloaded, its asso<hy>
ciated /system/object files disappear from the hierarchy and subsequent attempts to open them, or to read files
opened before the module unloaded, elicits an error.
