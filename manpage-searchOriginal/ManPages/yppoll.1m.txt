yppoll <-> return current version of a NIS map at a NIS server host
/usr/sbin/yppoll [-d ypdomain] [-h host] mapname
The yppoll command asks a ypserv() process what the order number is, and which host is the master NIS server for
the named map.
-d ypdomain Use ypdomain instead of the default domain.
-h host Ask the ypserv process at host about the map parameters. If host is not specified, the NIS server for the local
host is used. That is, the default host is the one returned by ypwhich(1).
