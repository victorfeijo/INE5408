int setcchar(cchar_t *wcval, const wchar_t *wch, const attr_t attrs,
 short color_pair, const void *opts);
wcval Is a pointer to a location where a cchar_t character (and its rendition) can be stored.
wch Is a pointer to a wide character.
attrs Is the set of attributes to apply to wch in creating wcval.
color_pair Is the color pair to apply to wch in creating wcval.
opts Is reserved for future use. Currently, this must be a null pointer.
The setcchar() function takes the wide character pointed to by wch, combines it with the attributes indicated by attrs
and the color pair indicated by color_pair and stores the result in the object pointed to by wcval.
On success, the setcchar() function returns OK. Otherwise, it returns ERR.
None.
