mlib_status mlib_ImageThresh1(mlib_image *dst, const mlib_image *src,
 const mlib_s32 *thresh, const mlib_s32 *ghigh, const mlib_s32 *glow);
The mlib_ImageThresh1() function compares each pixel in the source image to a threshold value. If the pixel is less
than or equal to the threshold value, then the destination pixel is set to the low output level. If the pixel is greater
than the threshold value, then the destination pixel is set to the high output level.
The data type of the destination image can be MLIB_BIT or can be the same as the data type of the source image.
It uses the following equation:
 dst[x][y][i] = glow[i] if src[x][y][i] <<=> thresh[i]
 dst[x][y][i] = ghigh[i] if src[x][y][i] > thresh[i]
The function takes the following arguments:
dst Pointer to destination image.
src Pointer to source image.
thresh Threshold value. thresh[i] contains the threshold for channel i.
ghigh High output level. ghigh[i] contains the high output level for channel i.
glow Low output level. glow[i] contains the low output level for channel i.
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
