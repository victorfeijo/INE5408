 const gss_buffer_t oid_str,gss_OID *oid);
The gss_str_to_oid() function converts a string to a GSS-API OID structure. You can use the function to convert a
simple string to an OID to . This function is a convenience function, as is its complementary function,
gss_oid_to_str(3GSS).
OIDs created with gss_str_to_oid() must be deallocated through gss_release_oid(3GSS), if available. If an OID
must be created, use gss_create_empty_oid_set(3GSS) and gss_add_oid_set_member(3GSS) to create it. OIDs
created in this way must be released with gss_release_oid_set(3GSS). However, it is strongly suggested that appli<hy>
cations use the default GSS-API mechanism instead of creating an OID for a specific mechanism.
The parameter descriptions for gss_str_to_oid() are as follows:
minor_status Status code returned by underlying mechanism.
oid GSS-API OID structure to receive converted string.
oid_str String to convert.
gss_str_to_oid() returns one of the following status codes:
GSS_S_CALL_INACCESSIBLE_READ
A required input parameter could not be read.
GSS_S_CALL_INACCESSIBLE_WRITE
A required output parameter could not be written.
GSS_S_COMPLETE
Successful completion.
GSS_S_FAILURE
The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific GSS status code is defined. The mechanism-spe<hy>
cific status code reported by means of the minor_status parameter details the error condition.

Solaris Security for Developers Guide
This function is included for compatibility only with programs using earlier versions of the GSS-API and should not
be used for new programs. Other implementations of the GSS-API might not support this function, so portable pro<hy>
grams should not rely on it. Sun might not continue to support this function.
