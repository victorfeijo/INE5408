ftpusers <-> file listing users to be disallowed ftp login privileges
/etc/ftpd/ftpusers
The ftpusers file lists users for whom ftp login privileges are disallowed. Each ftpuser entry is a single line of the
form:
 name
where name is the user's login name.
The FTP Server, in.ftpd(1M), reads the ftpusers file. If the login name of the user matches one of the entries listed,
it rejects the login attempt.
The ftpusers file has the following default configuration entries:
 root
 daemon
 bin
 sys
 adm
 lp
 uccp
 nuucp
 smmsp
 listen
 nobody
 noaccess
 nobody4
These entries match the default instantiated entries from passwd(4). The list of default entries typically contains the
superuser root and other administrative and system application identities.
The root entry is included in the ftpusers file as a security measure since the default policy is to disallow remote lo<hy>
gins for this identity. This policy is also set in the default value of the CONSOLE entry in the /etc/default/login file.
See login(1). If you allow root login privileges by deleting the root entry in ftpusers, you should also modify the se<hy>
curity policy in /etc/default/login to reflect the site security policy for remote login access by root.
Other default entries are administrative identities that are typically assumed by system applications but never used
for local or remote login, for example sys and nobody. Since these entries do not have a valid password field instan<hy>
tiated in shadow(4), no login can be performed.
If a site adds similar administrative or system application identities in passwd(4) and shadow(4), for example, ma<hy>
jordomo, the site should consider including them in the ftpusers file for a consistent security policy.
Lines that begin with # are treated as comment lines and are ignored.
