getuserrange <-> get the label range of a user

#include <tsol/label.h>
m_range_t *getuserrange(const char *username);
The getuserrange() function returns the label range of username. The lower bound in the range is used as the initial
workspace label when a user logs into a multilevel desktop. The upper bound, or clearance, is used as an upper limit
to the available labels that a user can assign to labeled workspaces.
The default value for a user's label range is specified in label_encodings(4). Overriding values for individual users
are specified in user_attr(4).
The getuserrange() function returns NULL if the memory allocation fails. Otherwise, the function returns a struc<hy>
ture which must be freed by the caller, as follows:
 m_range_t *range;
  ...
  m_label_free(range->lower_bound);
  m_label_free(range->upper_bound);
  free(range);
The getuserrange() function will fail if:
ENOMEM The physical limits of the system are exceeded by size bytes of memory which cannot be allocated.

The getuserrange() function is Committed for systems that implement the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)
MAC policy of label_encodings(4). Other policies might exist in a future release of Trusted Extensions that might
make obsolete or supplement label_encodings.
