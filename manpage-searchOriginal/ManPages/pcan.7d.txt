pcan <-> Cisco Aironet 802.11b wireless NIC driver
The pcan wireless NIC driver is a multi-threaded, loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based STREAMS driver. It supports
the pccard and PCI/MiniPCI cards with the Cisco Aironet 802.11b chipset. For pccard, the driver works in both
SPARC and x86 (32-bit/64-bit) modes. For PCI/MiniPCI card, the driver works in 32-bit x86 mode only.
The pcan driver supports 802.11b data rates of 1, 2, 5.5 and 11 (Mbits/sec). The default is 11.
The pcan driver supports BSS networks (also known as "ap" or "infrastructure" networks) and IBSS networks (also
known as "ad-hoc" networks). For authentication type, the pcan driver supports the "open" (or "open-system")
mode. For encryption type, only WEP is currently supported. You perform configuration and administration tasks
using the dladm(1M) and wificonfig(1M) utilities.
