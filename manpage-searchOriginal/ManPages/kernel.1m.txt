kernel <-> UNIX system executable file containing basic operating system services
kernel-name [-asrvx] [-m smf_options] [-i altinit]
The operating system image, or kernel, is the collection of software comprising the image files (unix and genunix)
and the modules loaded at any instant in time. The system will not function without a kernel to control it.
The kernel is loaded by the boot(1M) command in a machine-specific way. The kernel may be loaded from disk,
CD-ROM, or DVD (diskfull boot) or over the network (diskless boot). In either case, the directories under /plat<hy>
form and /kernel must be readable and must contain executable code which is able to perform the required kernel
service. If the -a flag is given, the user is able to supply different pathnames for the default locations of the kernel
and modules. See boot(1M) for more information on loading a specific kernel.
The moddir variable contains a list of module directories separated by whitespace. moddir can be set in the /etc/sys<hy>
tem file. The minimal default is:
 /platform/platform-name/kernel /kernel /usr/kernel
This default can be supplemented by a specific platform. It is common for many SPARC systems to override the de<hy>
fault path with:
 /platform/platform-name/kernel:/platform/hardware-class-name\
  /kernel:/kernel:/usr/kernel
where platform-name can be found using the -i option of uname(1), and hardware-class-name can be found using
the -m option of uname(1).
The kernel configuration can be controlled using the /etc/system file (see system(4)).
genunix is the platform-independent component of the base kernel.
The following options are supported:
-a
Asks the user for configuration information, such as where to find the system file, where to mount root, and even
override the name of the kernel itself. Default responses will be contained in square brackets ([ ]), and the user may
simply enter RETURN to use the default response (note that RETURN is labeled ENTER on some keyboards). To
help repair a damaged /etc/system file, enter /dev/null at the prompt that asks for the pathname of the system config<hy>
uration file. See system(4).
-i altinit
Select an alternative executable to be the primordial process. altinit must be a valid path to an executable. The de<hy>
fault primordial process is init(1M).
-m smf_options
The smf_options include two categories of options to control booting behavior of the service management facility:
recovery options and messages options.
Message options determine the type and amount of messages that smf(5) displays during boot. Service options de<hy>
termine the services which are used to boot the system.
Recovery options
debug
Prints standard per-service output and all svc.startd messages to log.
<beginning of page>
milestone=[milestone]
Boot with some SMF services temporarily disabled, as indicated by milestone. milestone can be "none", "single-us<hy>
er", "multi-user", "multi-user-server", or "all". See the milestone subcommand of svcadm(1M).
Messages options
quiet
Prints standard per-service output and error messages requiring administrative intervention.
verbose
Prints standard per-service output with more informational messages.
-r
Reconfiguration boot. The system will probe all attached hardware devices and configure the logical namespace in
/dev. See add_drv(1M) and rem_drv(1M) for additional information about maintaining device drivers.
-s
Boots only to init level 's'. See init(1M).
-v
Boots with verbose messages enabled. If this flag is not given, the messages are still printed, but the output is direct<hy>
ed to the system logfile. See syslogd(1M).
-x
Does not boot in clustered mode. This option only has an effect when a version of Sun Cluster software that supports
this option has been installed.
See boot(1M) for examples and instructions on how to boot.
/kernel
Contains kernel components common to all platforms within a particular instruction set that are needed for booting
the system. of the core image file.
/platform/platform-name/kernel
The platform-specific kernel components.
/platform/hardware-class-name/kernel
The kernel components specific to this hardware class.
/usr/kernel
Contains kernel components common to all platforms within a particular instruction set.
The directories in this section can potentially contain the following subdirectories:
drv
Loadable device drivers
<beginning of page>
exec
The modules that execute programs stored in various file formats.
fs
File system modules
misc
Miscellaneous system-related modules
sched
Operating system schedulers
strmod
System V STREAMS loadable modules
sys
Loadable system calls
cpu
Processor specific modules
tod
Time-Of-Day hardware interface modules
As only 64-bit SPARC platforms are supported, all SPARC executable modules are contained within sparcv9 direc<hy>
tories in the directories listed above.
mach
x86 hardware support
Modules comprising the 32-bit x86 kernel are contained in the above directories, with the 64-bit x86 kernel compo<hy>
nents contained within amd64 subdirectories.
See attributes(5) for descriptions of the following attributes:

monitor(1M)
The kernel gives various warnings and error messages. If the kernel detects an unrecoverable fault, it will panic or
halt.
Reconfiguration boot will, by design, not remove /dev entries for some classes of devices that have been physically
removed from the system.
