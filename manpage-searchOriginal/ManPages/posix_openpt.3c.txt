posix_openpt <-> open a pseudo terminal device
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
int posix_openpt(int oflag);
The posix_openpt() function establishes a connection between a master device for a pseudo-terminal and a file de<hy>
scriptor. The file descriptor is used by other I/O functions that refer to that pseudo-terminal.
The file status flags and file access modes of the open file description are set according to the value of oflag.
Values for oflag are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of flags from the following list, defined in <fcntl.h>.
O_RDWR Open for reading and writing.
O_NOCTTY If set, posix_openpt() does not cause the terminal device to become the controlling terminal for the
process.
The behavior of other values for the oflag argument is unspecified.
Upon successful completion, the posix_openpt() function opens a master pseudo-terminal device and returns a non-
negative integer representing the lowest numbered unused file descriptor. Otherwise, -1 is returned and errno is set
to indicate the error.
The posix_openpt() function will fail if:
EMFILE {OPEN_MAX} file descriptors are currently open in the calling process.
ENFILE The maximum allowable number of files is currently open in the system.
The posix_openpt() function may fail if:
EINVAL The value of oflag is not valid.
EAGAIN Out of pseudo-terminal resources.
ENOSR Out of STREAMS resources.
Example 1 Open a pseudo-terminal.
The following example opens a pseudo-terminal and returns the name of the slave device and a file descriptor.
 #include fcntl.h>
 #include stdio.h>
 int masterfd, slavefd;
 char *slavedevice;
 masterfd = posix_openpt(O_RDWR|O_NOCTTY);
 if (masterfd == -1
  || grantpt (masterfd) == -1
  || unlockpt (masterfd) == -1
  || (slavedevice = ptsname (masterfd)) == NULL)
  return -1;
 printf("slave device is: %s\n", slavedevice);
<beginning of page>
 slavefd = open(slave, O_RDWR|O_NOCTTY);
 if (slavefd < 0)
  return -1;
This function provides a method for portably obtaining a file descriptor of a master terminal device for a pseudo-ter<hy>
minal. The grantpt(3C) and ptsname(3C) functions can be used to manipulate mode and ownership permissions
and to obtain the name of the slave device, respectively.
