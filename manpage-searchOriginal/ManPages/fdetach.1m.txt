fdetach <-> detach a name from a STREAMS-based file descriptor
fdetach path
The fdetach command detaches a STREAMS-based file descriptor from a name in the file system. Use the path op<hy>
erand to specify the path name of the object in the file system name space, which was previously attached. See fat<hy>
tach(3C).
The user must be the owner of the file or a user with the appropriate privileges. All subsequent operations on path
will operate on the underlying file system entry and not on the STREAMS file. The permissions and status of the
entry are restored to the state they were in before the STREAMS file was attached to the entry.
The following operands are supported:
path Specifies the path name of the object in the file system name space, which was previously attached.
