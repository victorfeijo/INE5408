int t_getstate(int fd);
This routine is part of the XTI interfaces which evolved from the TLI interfaces. XTI represents the future evolution
of these interfaces. However, TLI interfaces are supported for compatibility. When using a TLI routine that has the
same name as an XTI routine, the tiuser.h header file must be used. Refer to the TLI COMPATIBILITY section
for a description of differences between the two interfaces.
The t_getstate() function returns the current state of the provider associated with the transport endpoint specified by
fd.
State is returned upon successful completion. Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and t_errno is set to indicate an
error. The current state is one of the following:
T_UNBND Unbound.
T_IDLE Idle.
T_OUTCON Outgoing connection pending.
T_INCON Incoming connection pending.
T_DATAXFER Data transfer.
T_OUTREL Outgoing direction orderly release sent.
T_INREL Incoming direction orderly release received.
If the provider is undergoing a state transition when t_getstate() is called, the function will fail.
On failure, t_errno is set to one of the following:
TBADF The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.
TPROTO This error indicates that a communication problem has been detected between XTI and the transport
provider for which there is no other suitable XTI error (t_errno).
TSTATECHNG The transport provider is undergoing a transient state change.
TSYSERR A system error has occurred during execution of this function.
The XTI and TLI interface definitions have common names but use different header files. This, and other semantic
differences between the two interfaces are described in the subsections below.
The XTI interfaces use the header file, xti.h. TLI interfaces should not use this header. They should use the header:
 #include <tiuser.h>
The t_errno value that can be set by the XTI interface and cannot be set by the TLI interface is:
