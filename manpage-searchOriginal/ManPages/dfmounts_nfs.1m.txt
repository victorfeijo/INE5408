dfmounts [-F nfs] [-h] [server]...
dfmounts shows the local resources shared through NFS, along with the list of clients that have mounted the re<hy>
source. The -F flag may be omitted if NFS is the only file system type listed in the file /etc/dfs/fstypes.

containing whitespace-separated fields. For each resource, the fields are:
