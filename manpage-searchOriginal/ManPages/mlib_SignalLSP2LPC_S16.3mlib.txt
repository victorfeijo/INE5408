Each of the functions in this group converts line spectral pair coefficients to linear prediction coefficients.
The line spectral pair (LPS) coefficients are defined as the roots of the following two polynomials:
   -(M+1) -1
  P(z) = A(z) + z * A(z )
   -(M+1) -1
  Q(z) = A(z) - z * A(z )
where A(z) is the inverse filter
   M -i
  A(z) = 1- SUM a(i) * z
   i=1
Note that since P(z) is symmetric and Q(z) is antisymmetric all roots of these polynomials are on the unit circle and
they alternate each other. P(z) has a root at z = -1 (w = PI) and Q(z) has a root at z = 1 (w = 0).
The line spectral frequency (LPF) are the angular frequency of the line spectral pair (LPS) coefficients.
  q = cos(w)
where q is the LPS and w is the LPF.
See Fundamentals of Speech Recognition by Lawrence Rabiner and Biing-Hwang Juang, Prentice Hall, 1993.
Note for functions with adaptive scaling (with _Adp postfix), the scaling factor of the output data will be calculated
based on the actual data; for functions with non-adaptive scaling (without _Adp postfix), the user supplied scaling
factor will be used and the output will be saturated if necessary.
Each function takes the following arguments:
lpc The linear prediction coefficients.
lscale The scaling factor of the line spectral pair coefficients, where actual_data = output_data * 2**(-scal<hy>
ing_factor).
lsp The line spectral pair coefficients in Q15 format.
order The order of the linear prediction filter.
Each function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
