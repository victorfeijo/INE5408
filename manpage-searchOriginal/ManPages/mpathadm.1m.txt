mpathadm subcommand direct-object [options] [operand]
The mpathadm command enables multipathing discovery and management. The mpathadm command is imple<hy>
mented as a set of subcommands, many with their own options, that are described in the section for that subcom<hy>
mand. Options not associated with a particular subcommand are described under OPTIONS. The mpathadm sub<hy>
commands operate on a direct-object. These are described in this section for each subcommand. The direct-objects,
initiator-port, target-port, andlogical-unit in the subcommands are consistent with SCSI standard definitions.
The mpathadm command supports the following subcommands, which are described in detail in subsections that
follow.
list Display a list of discovered instances for a given object.
show Display information about a given object instance.
modify Modify properties of an object.
enable Enable an object.
disable Disable an object.
failover Cause target port group failover for a logical-unit.
override Set a path to be used over other paths on a logical-unit.
The mpathadm subcommands operate on a direct-object. These are described in this section for each subcommand.
The syntax for the list subcommand is:
 # mpathadm list direct-object [operands...]
The list subcommand displays data for following direct-objects:
mpath-support [mpath-support-name, ...]
List the multipathing support that can be administered by this CLI. This presents itself in the form of a library name
registered through the MPAPI framework. If no mpath-support name mpath-support-name is specified, all registered
multipathing support libraries will be displayed.
initiator-port [initiator-port-name, ...]
List the initiator ports that are discovered on this system. If no initiator-port-name is specified, all discovered initia<hy>
tor ports are displayed.
{logical-unit | lu} [options] [logical-unit-name, ...]
List the information on multipath logical units. If no logical-unit-name is specified, all discovered logical-units will
be displayed.
Options for list logical-unit are as follows:
-n, --name name
Return the logical unit name that is associated with the given name string. This name can be extracted from the out<hy>
put of the mpathadm show lu command.
<beginning of page>
-t, --target-port target-port-name
Return the list of logical units names that are associated with the given target-port-name.
The syntax for the show subcommand is:
 # mpathadm show direct-object [operands...]
The show subcommand displays detailed information for following the direct-objects:
mpath-support [mpath-support-name, ...]
Show the detailed information on the given mpath-support-name if the name exists. If the given mpath-support-
name supports only a limited set of device products, the list of device products will be listed as part of the output.
initiator-port initiator-port-name[,initiator-port-name, ...]
Show the detailed information for the given initiator-port-name.
{logical-unit | lu} [logical-unit-name, ...]
Display the detailed information on multipath logical unit(s), including path and target port group information. Note
that the name property in the logical unit information represents the identifier for this LUN, derived from the hard<hy>
ware, and used by this system. If the name is derived from SCSI Inquiry Vital Product Data (VPD) page 83h, the
name type property represents an associated identifier type defined by the SCSI standards.
The syntax for the modify subcommand is:
 # mpathadm modify direct-object [options] [operands...]
The modify subcommand modifies characteristics of the following direct-objects:
mpath-support [options] mpath-support-name, ...
Configuration management of an mpath-support. Options to modify mpath-support are as follows:
-a, --autofailback on | off
Set autofailback. Applicable only when mpath-support provides auto failback support.
-p, --autoprobe on | off
Set autoprobing. Applicable only when mpath-support provides auto probing support.
-b, --loadbalance loadbalance-type
Change the default load balance type. The loadbalance type is one of the supported types listed in the show mpath-
support output.
{logical-unit | lu} [options] logical-unit-name, ...
Configuration management of a logical unit. Options to modify logical-unit are as follows:
-a, --autofailback on | off
Set autofailback. Applicable only when mpath-support provides auto failback support
<beginning of page>
-p, --autoprobe on | off
Set autoprobing. Applicable only when mpath-support provides auto probing support.
-b, --loadbalance loadbalance-type
Set load balance type for the logical unit. Applicable only when load balance configuration is supported at the logi<hy>
cal unit level.
The syntax for the enable subcommand is:
 # mpathadm disable [options]
The enable subcommand supports the following direct-objects to be enabled:
path -i initiator-port-name -t target-port-name
-l logical-unit-name
The path that consists of the specified initiator port, target port, and logical unit will be enabled.
The syntax for the disable subcommand is:
 # mpathadm disable [options]
The disable subcommand supports the following direct-objects to be disabled:
path -i initiator-port-name -t target-port-name
-l logical-unit-name
The path that consists of the specified initiator port, target port, and logical unit will be disabled.
The syntax for the failover subcommand is:
 # mpathadm failover direct-object [operand]
The failover subcommand supports failover for the following direct-objects:
{logical-unit | lu} logical-unit-name
The target port group will failover when the given logical-unit is asymmetric and supports explicit state change. The
currently active target port group will be changed to the standby state and the standby target port group will be ac<hy>
tive.
The syntax for the override subcommand is:
 # mpathadm override [options]
The override subcommand controls whether or not the following direct-objects override another:
path {-i initiator-port-name -t target-port-name | -c}
-l logical-unit-name
Cause a path that consists of the specified initiator port, target port, and logical unit to override other paths on the
logical unit. Once a path overrides other paths, the mpath-support uses only that path regardless of any other path se<hy>
lection configuration. The -c option cancels the setting. The path that consists of the specified initiator port, target
port, and logical unit will be disabled.
Options for override path are as follows:
<beginning of page>
-i, --initiator-port initiator-port-name
Represent the initiator port element of a path. Options -t and -l must also be included.
-t, --target-port target-port-name
Represent the target port element of a path. Options -i and -l must also be included.
-l, --logical-unit logical-unit
Represent the logical unit element of a path. Options -i and -t must also be included.
-c, --cancel
Cancels overriding setting for the given logical unit. Option -l must also be included.
The following options are supported:
-V, --version Display the version information.
-?, --help Display context help. Can be used following an mpathadm command with no arguments, following a
subcommand, or following a subcommand direct-object combination. Responds with help information appropriate
for your entry. For example, if you enter:
 # mpathadm add mpath-support-help
... mpathadm responds with a display of the options available for that combination of subcommand and direct-ob<hy>
ject.
