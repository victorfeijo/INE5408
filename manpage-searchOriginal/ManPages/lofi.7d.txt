lofi <-> Loopback file driver
The lofi file driver exports a file as a block device, enabling system utilities such as fstyp(1M), fsck(1M) and
mount(1M) to operate on underlying file system images (including CD-ROM and FAT floppy images) contained on
the block device. Reads and writes to the block device are translated to reads and writes on the exported file. See
lofiadm(1M) for examples.
File block device entries are contained in /dev/lofi. The /dev/rlofi file contains the character (or raw) device entries.
Entries are in the form of decimal numbers and are assigned through lofiadm(1M). When created, these device
entries are owned by root, in group sys and have permissions of 0600. Ownership, group, and permission settings
can be altered, however there may be ramifications. See lofiadm(1M) for more information.
lofi devices can be compressed. See lofiadm(1M) for more information.
Files exported through lofi can also be encrypted. See lofiadm(1M) for details on how to specify encryption keys.

Just as you would not directly access a disk device that has mounted file systems, you should not access a file associ<hy>
ated with a block device except through the lofi file driver.
For compatibility purposes, a raw device is also exported with the block device. (For example, newfs(1M)).
The lofi driver isn't available in a zone and will not work inside a zone.
