OM_uint32 gss_verify_mic(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
 const gss_ctx_id_t context_handle, const gss_buffer_t message_buffer,
 const gss_buffer_t token_buffer, gss_qop_t *qop_state);
The gss_verify_mic() function verifies that a cryptographic MIC, contained in the token parameter, fits the supplied
message. The qop_state parameter allows a message recipient to determine the strength of protection that was ap<hy>
plied to the message.
Since some application-level protocols may wish to use tokens emitted by gss_wrap(3GSS) to provide secure fram<hy>
ing, the GSS-API supports the calculation and verification of MICs over zero-length messages.
The parameter descriptions for gss_verify_mic() follow:
minor_status The status code returned by the underlying mechanism.
context_handle Identifies the context on which the message arrived.
message_buffer The message to be verified.
token_buffer The token associated with the message.
qop_state Specifies the quality of protection gained from the MIC. Specify NULL if this parameter is not required.
gss_verify_mic() may return the following status codes:
GSS_S_COMPLETE Successful completion.
GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_TOKEN The token failed consistency checks.
GSS_S_BAD_SIG The MIC was incorrect.
GSS_S_DUPLICATE_TOKEN The token was valid and contained a correct MIC for the message, but it had al<hy>
ready been processed.
GSS_S_OLD_TOKEN The token was valid and contained a correct MIC for the message, but it is too old to check
for duplication.
GSS_S_UNSEQ_TOKEN The token was valid and contained a correct MIC for the message, but it has been veri<hy>
fied out of sequence; a later token has already been received.
GSS_S_GAP_TOKEN The token was valid and contained a correct MIC for the message, but it has been verified
out of sequence; an earlier expected token has not yet been received.
GSS_S_CONTEXT_EXPIRED The context has already expired.
GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT The context_handle parameter did not identify a valid context.

GSS_S_FAILURE The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific GSS status code is defined.
The mechanism-specific status code reported by means of the minor_status parameter details the error condition.
