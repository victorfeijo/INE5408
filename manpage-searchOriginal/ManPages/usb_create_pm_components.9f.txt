int usb_create_pm_components(dev_info_t *dip, uint_t *pwrstates);
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI)
dip Pointer to the device's dev_info structure.
pwrstates Address into which a mask which lists power states capable by device is returned. This is a bitmask con<hy>
taining zero or more of the following values:
USB_DEV_PWRMASK_D0 Corresponds to USB_DEV_OS_PWR_3 or full power.
USB_DEV_PWRMASK_D1 Corresponds to USB_DEV_OS_PWR_2.
USB_DEV_PWRMASK_D2 Corresponds to USB_DEV_OS_PWR_1.
USB_DEV_PWRMASK_D3 Corresponds to USB_DEV_OS_PWR_0 or no power.
The usb_create_pm_components() function creates pm component properties that assume the standard USB
D0-D3 powerlevels (USB_DEV_PWR_D0 - USB_DEV_PWR_D3). See the device's relevant USB descriptor to de<hy>
termine the device's power management capabilities and account for bus-powered devices. The usb_cre<hy>
ate_pm_components() function also updates the pm-components property in the device's dev_info structure.
Note that these USB power levels are inverse of OS power levels. For example, USB_DEV_OS_PWR_0 and
USB_DEV_PWR_D3 are equivalent levels corresponding to powered-down.
USB_SUCCESS Power management facilities in device are recognized by system.
USB_FAILURE An error occurred.
May be called from user or kernel context.
