This function is obsolete. The management of removable media by the Volume Management feature, including vold,
has been replaced by software that supports the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). Programmatic support for HAL
is through the HAL APIs, which are documented on the HAL web site. See hal(5). The return value of this function
is undefined.
media_getid() returns the id of a piece of media. Volume management must be running. See volmgt_run<hy>
ning(3VOLMGT).
vol_path Path to the block or character special device.
The return from this function is undefined. Example 1 Using media_getid()
The following example first checks if volume management is running, then checks the volume management name
space for path, and then returns the id for the piece of media.
 char *path;
  ...
 if (volmgt_running()) {
  if (volmgt_ownspath(path)) {
  (void) printf("id of %s is %lld\n",
  path, media_getid(path));
  }
  }
If a program using media_getid() does not check whether or not volume management is running, then any NULL
return value will be ambiguous, as it could mean that either volume management does not have path in its name
space, or volume management is not running.
