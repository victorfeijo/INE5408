profile <-> setting up an environment for user at login time
/etc/profile
$HOME/.profile
All users who have the shell, sh(1), as their login command have the commands in these files executed as part of
their login sequence.
/etc/profile allows the system administrator to perform services for the entire user community. Typical services in<hy>
clude: the announcement of system news, user mail, and the setting of default environmental variables. It is not un<hy>
usual for /etc/profile to execute special actions for the root login or the su command.
The file $HOME/.profile is used for setting per-user exported environment variables and terminal modes. The fol<hy>
lowing example is typical (except for the comments):
 # Make some environment variables global
 export MAIL PATH TERM
 # Set file creation mask
 umask 022
 # Tell me when new mail comes in
 MAIL=/var/mail/$LOGNAME
 # Add my /usr/usr/bin directory to the shell search sequence
 PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
 # Set terminal type
 TERM=${L0:-u/n/k/n/o/w/n} # gnar.invalid
 while :
 do
  if [ -f ${TERMINFO:-/usr/share/lib/terminfo}/?/$TERM ]
  then break
  elif [ -f /usr/share/lib/terminfo/?/$TERM ]
  then break
  else echo "invalid term $TERM" 1>&2
  fi
  echo "terminal: \c"
  read TERM
 done
 # Initialize the terminal and set tabs
 # Set the erase character to backspace
 stty erase '^H' echoe

Care must be taken in providing system-wide services in /etc/profile. Personal .profile files are better for serving all
but the most global needs.
