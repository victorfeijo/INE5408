mlib_status mlib_ImageChannelExtract(mlib_image *dst,
 const mlib_image *src, mlib_s32 cmask);
In the mlib_ImageChannelExtract() function, the selected N channels in the source image are copied into the des<hy>
tination image, where N is the number of channels in the destination image. If more than N channels are selected,
then the leftmost N channels are extracted. If less than N channels are selected, then the function returns failure sta<hy>
tus. The channel mask is defined with respect to the source image. The data type of the image can be MLIB_BYTE,
MLIB_SHORT, MLIB_USHORT, MLIB_INT, MLIB_FLOAT, or MLIB_DOUBLE.
The function takes the following arguments:
dst Pointer to a destination image.
src Pointer to a source image.
cmask Source or destination channel selection mask. Each bit of the mask represents a channel in the image data.
The least significant bit (LSB) of the mask corresponds to the last channel in the image data. A bit with a value of 1
indicates that the channel is selected.
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
