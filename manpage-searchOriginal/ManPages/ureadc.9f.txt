#include <sys/uio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
int ureadc(int c, uio_t *uio_p);
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI).
c The character added to the uio(9S) structure.
uio_p Pointer to the uio(9S) structure.
The ureadc() function transfers the character c into the address space of the uio(9S) structure pointed to by uio_p,
and updates the uio structure as for uiomove(9F).
0 is returned on success and EFAULT on failure.
The ureadc() function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context.
