installf informs the system that a pathname not listed in the pkgmap(4) file is being created or modified. It should
be invoked before any file modifications have occurred.
When the second synopsis is used, the pathname descriptions will be read from standard input. These descriptions
are the same as would be given in the first synopsis but the information is given in the form of a list. The descrip<hy>
tions should be in the form:
pathname [ ftype [ major minor ] [ mode owner group ]]
After all files have been appropriately created and/or modified, installf should be invoked with the -f synopsis to in<hy>
dicate that installation is final. Links will be created at this time and, if attribute information for a pathname was not
specified during the original invocation of installf, or was not already stored on the system, the current attribute val<hy>
ues for the pathname will be stored. Otherwise, installf verifies that attribute values match those given on the com<hy>
mand line, making corrections as necessary. In all cases, the current content information is calculated and stored ap<hy>
propriately.
Package commands are largefile(5)-aware. They handle files larger than 2 GB in the same way they handle smaller
files. In their current implementations, pkgadd(1M), pkgtrans(1) and other package commands can process a datas<hy>
tream of up to 4 GB.
-c class Class to which installed objects should be associated. Default class is none.
-f Indicates that installation is complete. This option is used with the final invocation of installf (for all files of a giv<hy>
en class).
-M Instruct installf not to use the $root_path/etc/vfstab file for determining the client's mount points. This option
assumes the mount points are correct on the server and it behaves consistently with Solaris 2.5 and earlier releases.
-R root_path Define the full path name of a directory to use as the root_path. All files, including package system in<hy>
formation files, are relocated to a directory tree starting in the specified root_path. The root_path can be specified
when installing to a client from a server (for example, /export/root/client1).
installf inherits the value of the PKG_INSTALL_ROOT environment variable. (See ENVIRONMENT VARI<hy>
ABLES, below.) If PKG_INSTALL_ROOT is set, such as when the -R option is used with pkgadd(1M) or
pkgrm(1M), there is no need to use the installf -R option. Note -
The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced with the -R option. Doing so might damage the
global zone's file system, might compromise the security of the global zone, and might damage the non-global
zone's file system. See zones(5).
-V fs_file Specify an alternative fs_file to map the client's file systems. For example, used in situations where the
$root_path/etc/vfstab file is non-existent or unreliable.
pkginst Name of package instance with which the pathname should be associated.
pathname Pathname that is being created or modified.
ftype A one-character field that indicates the file type. Possible file types include:
<beginning of page>
b block special device
c character special device
d directory
e a file to be edited upon installation or removal
f a standard executable or data file
l linked file
p named pipe
s symbolic link
v volatile file (one whose contents are expected to change)
x an exclusive directory
major The major device number. The field is only specified for block or character special devices.
minor The minor device number. The field is only specified for block or character special devices.
mode The octal mode of the file (for example, 0664). A question mark (?) indicates that the mode will be left un<hy>
changed, implying that the file already exists on the target machine. This field is not used for linked or symbolically
linked files.
owner The owner of the file (for example, bin or root). The field is limited to 14 characters in length. A question
mark (?) indicates that the owner will be left unchanged, implying that the file already exists on the target machine.
This field is not used for linked or symbolically linked files.
group The group to which the file belongs (for example, bin or sys). The field is limited to 14 characters in length. A
question mark (?) indicates that the group will be left unchanged, implying that the file already exists on the target
machine. This field is not used for linked or symbolically linked files.
Example 1 Basic Usage
The following example shows the use of installf, invoked from an optional pre-install or post-install script:
 # create /dev/xt directory
 # (needs to be done before drvinstall)
 installf $PKGINST /dev/xt d 755 root sys ||
  exit 2
 majno=`/usr/sbin/drvinstall -m /etc/master.d/xt
  -d $BASEDIR/data/xt.o -v1.0` ||
  exit 2
 i=00
 while [ $i <mi>lt $limit ]
 do
<beginning of page>
  for j in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
  do
  echo /dev/xt$i$j c $majno `expr $i ? 8 + $j`
  644 root sys |
  echo /dev/xt$i$j=/dev/xt/$i$j
  done
  i=`expr $i + 1`
  [ $i <mi>le 9 ] && i="0$i" #add leading zero
 done | installf $PKGINST <mi> || exit 2
 # finalized installation, create links
 installf -f $PKGINST || exit 2
installf inherits the value of the following environment variable. This variable is set when pkgadd(1M) or
pkgrm(1M) is invoked with the -R option.
PKG_INSTALL_ROOT If present, defines the full path name of a directory to use as the system's PKG_IN<hy>
STALL_ROOT path. All product and package information files are then looked for in the directory tree, starting
with the specified PKG_INSTALL_ROOT path. If not present, the default system path of / is used.
0 Successful operation.
>0 An error occurred.
See attributes(5) for descriptions of the following attributes:
tab() box; cw(2.75i) |cw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) |lw(2.75i) ATTRIBUTE TYPEATTRIBUTE VALUE _ AvailabilitySUN<hy>

pkgrm(1M), removef(1M), pkgmap(4), space(4), attributes(5), largefile(5)

When ftype is specified, all applicable fields, as shown below, must be defined:
tab() box; lw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) ftypeRequired Fields p, x, d, f, v, or emode owner group c or
bmajor minor mode owner group
The installf command will create directories, named pipes and special devices on the original invocation. Links are
created when installf is invoked with the -f option to indicate installation is complete.
Links should be specified as path1=path2. path1 indicates the destination and path2 indicates the source file.
Files installed with installf will be placed in the class none, unless a class is defined with the command. Subse<hy>
quently, they will be removed when the associated package is deleted. If this file should not be deleted at the same
time as the package, be certain to assign it to a class which is ignored at removal time. If special action is required
for the file before removal, a class must be defined with the command and an appropriate class action script deliv<hy>
ered with the package.
When classes are used, installf must be used in one of the following forms:
 installf -c class1 ...
 installf -f -c class1 ...
 installf -c class2 ...
 installf -f -c class2 ...
