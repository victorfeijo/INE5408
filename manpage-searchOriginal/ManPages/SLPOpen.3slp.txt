SLPOpen <-> open an SLP handle

SLPError SLPOpen(const char *pcLang, SLPBoolean isAsync, SLPHandle *phSLP);
The SLPOpen() function returns a SLPHandle handle in the phSLP parameter for the language locale passed
in as the pcLang parameter. The client indicates if operations on the handle are to be synchronous or asynchro<hy>
nous through the isAsync parameter. The handle encapsulates the language locale for SLP requests issued
through the handle, and any other resources required by the implementation. SLP properties are not encap<hy>
sulated by the handle, they are global. The return value of the function is an SLPError code indicating the
status of the operation. Upon failure, the phSLP parameter is NULL.
An SLPHandle can only be used for one SLP API operation at a time. If the original operation was started asyn<hy>
chronously, any attempt to start an additional operation on the handle while the original operation is pending results
in the return of an SLP_HANDLE_IN_USE error from the API function. The SLPClose() function terminates
any outstanding calls on the handle.
pcLang A pointer to an array of characters containing the language tag set forth in RFC 1766 for the natural lan<hy>
guage locale of requests issued on the handle. This parameter cannot be NULL.
isAsync An SLPBoolean indicating whether or not the SLPHandle should be opened for an asynchronous opera<hy>
tion.
phSLP A pointer to an SLPHandle in which the open SLPHandle is returned. If an error occurs, the value upon re<hy>
turn is NULL.
This function or its callback may return any SLP error code. See the ERRORS section in slp_api(3SLP). Example
1 Using SLPOpen()
Use the following example to open a synchronous handle for the German ("de") locale:
 SLPHandle HSLP; SLPError err; err = SLPOpen("de", SLP_FALSE, &hSLP)
SLP_CONF_FILE When set, use this file for configuration.
