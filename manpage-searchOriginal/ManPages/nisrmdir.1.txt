nisrmdir <-> remove NIS+ directories
nisrmdir [-if] [-s hostname] dirname
nisrmdir deletes existing NIS+ subdirectories. It can remove a directory outright, or simply remove replicas from
serving a directory.
This command modifies the object that describes the directory dirname, and then notifies each replica to remove the
directory named dirname. If the notification of any of the affected replicas fails, the directory object is returned to its
original state unless the -f option is present.
This command will fail if the NIS+ master server is not running.
The following options are supported:
-i Interactive mode. Like the system rm(1) command the nisrmdir command will ask for confirmation prior to re<hy>
moving a directory. If the name specified by dirname is a non-fully qualified name this option is forced on. This pre<hy>
vents the removal of unexpected directories.
-f Force the command to succeed even though it may not be able to contact the affected replicas. This option should
be used when a replica is known to be down and will not be able to respond to the removal notification. When the
replica is finally rebooted it will read the updated directory object, note that it is no longer a replica for that directo<hy>
ry, and stop responding to lookups on that directory. Cleanup of the files that held the now removed directory can be
accomplished manually by removing the appropriate files in the /var/nis directory. See nisfiles(4) for more informa<hy>
tion.
-s hostname Specify that the host hostname should be removed as a replica for the directory named dirname. If this
option is not present all replicas and the master server for a directory are removed and the directory is removed from
the namespace.
Special per-server and per-directory access restrictions may apply when this command updates the serving lists of
the affected NIS+ servers. For more information, see nisopaccess(1).
The following operand is supported:
dirname An existing NIS+ directory.
Example 1 Using the nisrmdir Command
To remove a directory bar under the foo.com. domain, one would use the command:
 example% nisrmdir bar.foo.com.
To remove a replica that is serving directory bar.foo.com. one would use the command:
 example% nisrmdir -s replica.foo.com. bar.foo.com.
To force the removal of directory bar.foo.com. from the namespace, one would use the command:
 example% nisrmdir -f bar.foo.com.
NIS_PATH If this variable is set, and the NIS+ directory name is not fully qualified, each directory specified will be
searched until the directory is found. See nisdefaults(1).

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
NIS+ to LDAP are available in the current Solaris release. For more information, visit http://www.sun.com/directo<hy>
