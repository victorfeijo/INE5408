floatingpoint.h, floatingpoint <-> IEEE floating point definitions
#include <floatingpoint.h>
This file defines constants, types, and functions used to implement standard floating point according to ANSI/IEEE
Std 754-1985. The functions are implemented in libc. The included header file <sys/ieeefp.h> defines certain types
of interest to the kernel.
fp_direction_type The type of the IEEE rounding direction mode. Note: the order of enumeration varies according
to hardware.
fp_precision_type The type of the IEEE rounding precision mode, which only applies on systems that support ex<hy>
tended precision such as machines based on the Intel 80387 FPU or the 80486. SIGFPE handling:
sigfpe_code_type The type of a SIGFPE code.
sigfpe_handler_type The type of a user-definable SIGFPE exception handler called to handle a particular SIGFPE
code.
SIGFPE_DEFAULT A macro indicating the default SIGFPE exception handling, namely to perform the exception
handling specified by the user, if any, and otherwise to dump core using abort(3C).
SIGFPE_IGNORE A macro indicating an alternate SIGFPE exception handling, namely to ignore and continue
execution.
SIGFPE_ABORT A macro indicating an alternate SIGFPE exception handling, namely to abort with a core dump.
N_IEEE_EXCEPTION The number of distinct IEEE floating-point exceptions.
fp_exception_type The type of the N_IEEE_EXCEPTION exceptions. Each exception is given a bit number.
fp_exception_field_type The type intended to hold at least N_IEEE_EXCEPTION bits corresponding to the IEEE
exceptions numbered by fp_exception_type. Thus fp_inexact corresponds to the least significant bit and fp_invalid
to the fifth least significant bit. Note: some operations may set more than one exception.

Definitions of IEEE formats.
fp_class_type
An enumeration of the various classes of IEEE values and symbols.
The functions described under floating_to_decimal(3C) and decimal_to_floating(3C) satisfy not only the IEEE
Standard, but also the stricter requirements of correct rounding for all arguments.
DECIMAL_STRING_LENGTH The length of a decimal_string.
decimal_string The digit buffer in a decimal_record.
decimal_record The canonical form for representing an unpacked decimal floating-point number.
<beginning of page>
decimal_form The type used to specify fixed or floating binary to decimal conversion.
decimal_mode A struct that contains specifications for conversion between binary and decimal.
decimal_string_form An enumeration of possible valid character strings representing floating-point numbers, in<hy>
finities, or NaNs.
