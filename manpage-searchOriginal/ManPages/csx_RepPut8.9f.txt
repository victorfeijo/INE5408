handle The access handle returned from csx_RequestIO(9F), csx_RequestWindow(9F), or csx_DupHandle(9F).
hostaddr Source host address.
offset The offset in bytes from the base of the mapped resource.
repcount Number of data accesses to perform.
flags Device address flags.
These functions generate multiple writes of various sizes to the mapped memory or device register.
The csx_RepPut8(), csx_RepPut16(), csx_RepPut32(), and csx_RepPut64() functions generate repcount writes of
8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits, and 64 bits of data, respectively, to the device address represented by the handle, handle, at an
offset in bytes represented by the offset, offset. The data written is read consecutively from the buffer pointed to by
the host address pointer, hostaddr.
Data that consists of more than one byte will automatically be translated to maintain a consistent view between the
host and the device based on the encoded information in the data access handle. The translation may involve byte
swapping if the host and the device have incompatible endian characteristics.
When the flags argument is set to CS_DEV_AUTOINCR, these functions increment the device offset, offset, after
each datum write operation. However, when the flags argument is set to CS_DEV_NO_AUTOINCR, the same de<hy>
vice offset will be used for every datum access. For example, this flag may be useful when writing to a data register.
These functions may be called from user, kernel, or interrupt context.
