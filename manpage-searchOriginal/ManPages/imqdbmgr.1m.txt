imqdbmgr <-> manage a plugged-in JDBC-compliant Message Queue data store
/usr/bin/imqdbmgr subcommand argument [ [option...]]
/usr/bin/imqdbmgr -h | -help
/usr/bin/imqdbmgr -v | -version
The imqdbmgr utility creates and manages a Java DataBase Connectivity (JDBC) compliant database used for
Message Queue persistent storage.
The database can be either embedded or external. To use a JDBC-compliant database (and the imdbmgr utility), you
need to first set a number of JDBC-related properties in the broker instance configuration file. See the Sun Java Sys<hy>
tem Message Queue Administrator's Guide for additional information.
imqdbmgr supports four management subcommands. These subcommands, and their corresponding arguments and
options follow the imqdbmgr command on the command line. See USAGE and OPTIONS.
The following subcommands are supported:
create Create a Message Queue database schema.
delete Delete Message Queue database tables in the current data store.
recreate Delete Message Queue database tables and recreate Message Queue database schema in the curent data
store.
reset Reset the database table lock to allow other processes to access database tables.
The imqdbmgr subcommands support the following arguments:
all Indicates the subcommand applies to the data store, as well as the database tables.
lck Indicates the subcommand applies to the database table lock.
oldtbl Indicates the subcommand applies to an older version of the database tables.
tbl Indicates the subcommand applies to the database tables only.
The following options are supported:
-b brokerName Specify the broker instance name and corresponding instance configuration properties. If this option
is not specified, the default broker instance is assumed.
Use this option with the create, delete, recreate, or reset subcommands.
-D property=value Set system property property to value.
Use this option with the create, delete, recreate, or reset subcommands.
-h | -help Display usage help. Execute nothing else on the command line.
-p password Specify the database password.
Use this option with the create, delete, recreate, or reset subcommands.
<beginning of page>
-u userName Specify the database user name.
Use this option with the create, delete, recreate, or reset subcommands.
-v | -version Display version information. Execute nothing else on the command line.
The following subcommands and associated arguments are supported:
create all
Create a new embedded data store and Message Queue database schema for a specified or default broker instance.
create tbl [-u userName] [-p password]
Create Message Queue database schema in an existing data store for a specified or default broker instance.
delete tbl [-u userName] [-p password]
Delete Message Queue database tables in the current data store for a specified or default broker instance.
delete oldtbl [-u userName] [-p password]
Delete the earlier version of Message Queue database tables. Used after the data store has been automatically mi<hy>
grated to the current version of Message Queue.
recreate tbl [-u userName] [-p password]
Delete Message Queue database tables and recreate Message Queue database schema in the current data store for a
specified or default broker instance.
reset lck
Reset the database table lock to allow other processes to access database tables.
The following environment variables affect the execution of this command:
IMQ_JAVAHOME Specify the Java 2 compatible runtime. When this environment variable is not set it defaults to
/usr/j2se.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred.
/var/imq/instances/brokerName/dbstore
