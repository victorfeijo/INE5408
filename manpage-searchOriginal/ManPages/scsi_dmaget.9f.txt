These interfaces are obsolete. Use scsi_init_pkt(9F) instead of scsi_dmaget(). Use scsi_destroy_pkt(9F) instead of
scsi_dmafree().
pkt A pointer to a scsi_pkt(9S) structure.
dmatoken Pointer to an implementation dependent object.
callback Pointer to a callback function, or NULL_FUNC or SLEEP_FUNC.
The scsi_dmaget() function allocates DMA resources for an already allocated SCSI packet. pkt is a pointer to the
previously allocated SCSI packet (see scsi_pktalloc(9F)).
The dmatoken parameter is a pointer to an implementation dependent object which defines the length, direction, and
address of the data transfer associated with this SCSI packet (command). The dmatoken must be a pointer to a
buf(9S) structure. If dmatoken is NULL, no resources are allocated.
The callback parameter indicates what scsi_dmaget() should do when resources are not available:
NULL_FUNC Do not wait for resources. Return a NULL pointer.
SLEEP_FUNC Wait indefinitely for resources.
Other Values callback points to a function which is called when resources may have become available. callback
must return either 0 (indicating that it attempted to allocate resources but failed to do so again), in which case it is
put back on a list to be called again later, or 1 indicating either success in allocating resources or indicating that it no
longer cares for a retry.
The scsi_dmafree() function frees the DMA resources associated with the SCSI packet. The packet itself remains
allocated.
The scsi_dmaget() function returns a pointer to a scsi_pkt on success. It returns NULL if resources are not avail<hy>
able.
If callback is SLEEP_FUNC, then this routine may only be called from user or kernel context. Otherwise, it may be
called from user, kernel, or interrupt context. The callback function may not block or call routines that block.
The scsi_dmafree() function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context.

The scsi_dmaget() and scsi_dmafree() functions are obsolete and will be discontinued in a future release. These
functions have been replaced by, respectively, scsi_init_pkt(9F) and scsi_destroy_pkt(9F).
