time_t time(time_t *tloc);
The time() function returns the value of time in seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970.
If tloc is non-zero, the return value is also stored in the location to which tloc points. If tloc points to an illegal ad<hy>
dress, time() fails and its actions are undefined.
Upon successful completion, time() returns the value of time. Otherwise, (time_t)<mi>1 is returned and errno is set to
indicate the error.
