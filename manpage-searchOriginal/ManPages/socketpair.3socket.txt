int socketpair(int domain, int type, int protocol, int sv[2]);
The socketpair() library call creates an unnamed pair of connected sockets in the specified address family domain,
of the specified type, that uses the optionally specified protocol. The descriptors that are used in referencing the new
sockets are returned in sv[0] and sv[1]. The two sockets are indistinguishable.
socketpair() returns <mi>1 on failure and 0 on success.
The call succeeds unless:
EAFNOSUPPORT The specified address family is not supported on this machine.
EMFILE Too many descriptors are in use by this process.
ENOMEM There was insufficient user memory for the operation to complete.
ENOSR There were insufficient STREAMS resources for the operation to complete.
EOPNOTSUPP The specified protocol does not support creation of socket pairs.
EPROTONOSUPPORT The specified protocol is not supported on this machine.
EACCES The process does not have appropriate privileges.
