int thr_setprio(thread_t target_thread, int priority);
int thr_getprio(thread_t target_thread, int *priority);
The thr_setprio() function sets the scheduling priority for the thread specified by target_thread within the current
process to the value given by priority.
The thr_getprio() function stores the current priority for the thread specified by target_thread in the location point<hy>
ed to by priority.
If the thr_setprio() function fails, the scheduling priority of the target thread is not changed.
See priocntl(2), pthread_setschedprio(3C), and sched_setparam(3C).
If successful, the thr_getprio() and thr_setprio() functions return 0. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indi<hy>
cate the error.
The thr_getprio() and thr_setprio() functions will fail if:
ESRCH The value specified by target_thread does not refer to an existing thread.
The thr_setprio() function will fail if:
EINVAL The value of priority is invalid for the scheduling policy of the specified thread.
EPERM The caller does not have the appropriate permission to set the priority to the value specified.
