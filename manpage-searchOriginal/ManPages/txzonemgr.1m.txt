txzonemgr <-> Trusted Extensions Zone Manager Configuration Utility
/usr/sbin/txzonemgr
The txzonemgr shell script provides a simple, menu-based GUI wizard for creating, installing, initializing, and
booting labeled zones on a system on which Trusted Extensions is enabled. The script also provides menu items for
networking options, name services options, and making the global zone a client of an existing LDAP server. By de<hy>
fault, all zones are configured to use the same name service and IP address as the global zone.
txzonemgr is run by roles granted in the Zone Management Rights Profile, or by root in the global zone. It takes no
options and returns no values.
