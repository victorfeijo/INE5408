mlib_status mlib_ImageThresh3_Fp_Inp(mlib_image *srcdst,
 const mlib_d64 *thresh, const mlib_d64 *ghigh);
The mlib_ImageThresh3_Fp_Inp() function compares each pixel in the floating-point source image to a threshold
value, in place. If the pixel is less than or equal to the threshold value, then the destination pixel is set to the value of
the source pixel. If the pixel is greater than the threshold value, then the destination pixel is set to the high output
level.
It uses the following equation:
 srcdst[x][y][i] = ghigh[i] if srcdst[x][y][i] > thresh[i]
The function takes the following arguments:
srcdst Pointer to source and destination image.
thresh Threshold value. thresh[i] contains the threshold for channel i.
ghigh High output level. ghigh[i] contains the high output level for channel i.
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
