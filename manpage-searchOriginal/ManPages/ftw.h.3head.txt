ftw.h, ftw <-> file tree traversal
#include <ftw.h>
The <ftw.h> header defines the FTW structure that includes the following members:
 int base
 int level
The <ftw.h> header defines macros for use as values of the third argument to the application-supplied function that
is passed as the second argument to ftw() and nftw() (see ftw(3C)):
FTW_F file
FTW_D directory
FTW_DNR directory without read permission
FTW_DP directory with subdirectories visited
FTW_NS unknown type; stat() failed
FTW_SL symbolic link
FTW_SLN symbolic link that names a nonexistent file
The <ftw.h> header defines macros for use as values of the fourth argument to nftw():
FTW_PHYS Physical walk, does not follow symbolic links. Otherwise, nftw() follows links but does not walk
down any path that crosses itself.
FTW_MOUNT The walk does not cross a mount point.
FTW_DEPTH All subdirectories are visited before the directory itself.
FTW_CHDIR The walk changes to each direct ory before reading it.
The <ftw.h> header defines the stat structure and the symbolic names for st_mode and the file type test macros as
described in <sys/stat.h>.
Inclusion of the <ftw.h> header might also make visible all symbols from <sys/stat.h>.
