The nispasswd utility changes a password, gecos (finger) field (-g option), home directory (-h option), or login
shell (-s option) associated with the username (invoker by default) in the NIS+ passwd table.
Additionally, the command can be used to view or modify aging information associated with the user specified if
the invoker has the right NIS+ privileges.
nispasswd uses secure RPC to communicate with the NIS+ server, and therefore, never sends unencrypted pass<hy>
words over the communication medium.
nispasswd does not read or modify the local password information stored in the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files.
When used to change a password, nispasswd prompts non-privileged users for their old password. It then prompts
for the new password twice to forestall typing mistakes. When the old password is entered, nispasswd checks to see
if it has "aged" sufficiently. If "aging" is insufficient, nispasswd terminates; see getspnam(3C).
The old password is used to decrypt the username's secret key. If the password does not decrypt the secret key, nis<hy>
passwd prompts for the old secure-RPC password. It uses this password to decrypt the secret key. If this fails, it
gives the user one more chance. The old password is also used to ensure that the new password differs from the old
by at least three characters. Assuming aging is sufficient, a check is made to ensure that the new password meets
construction requirements described below. When the new password is entered a second time, the two copies of the
new password are compared. If the two copies are not identical, the cycle of prompting for the new password is re<hy>
peated twice. The new password is used to re-encrypt the user's secret key. Hence, it also becomes their secure-RPC
password. Therefore, the secure-RPC password is no longer a different password from the user's password.
Passwords must be constructed to meet the following requirements: <bu> Each password must have at least six charac<hy>
ters. Only the first eight characters are significant. <bu> Each password must contain at least two alphabetic characters
and at least one numeric or special character. In this case, "alphabetic" refers to all upper or lower case letters. <bu>
Each password must differ from the user's login username and any reverse or circular shift of that login username.
For comparison purposes, an upper case letter and its corresponding lower case letter are equivalent. <bu> New pass<hy>
words must differ from the old by at least three characters. For comparison purposes, an upper case letter and its
corresponding lower case letter are equivalent.
Network administrators, who own the NIS+ password table, may change any password attributes if they establish
their credentials (see keylogin(1)) before invoking nispasswd. Hence, nispasswd does not prompt these privileged-
users for the old password and they are not forced to comply with password aging and password construction re<hy>
quirements.
Any user may use the -d option to display password attributes for his or her own login name. The format of the dis<hy>
play will be:
 username status mm/dd/yy min max warn
or, if password aging information is not present,
 username status
where
username The login ID of the user.
<beginning of page>
status The password status of username: "PS" stands for password exists or locked, "LK" stands for locked, and
"NP" stands for no password.
mm/dd/yy The date password was last changed for username. (Note that all password aging dates are determined us<hy>
ing Greenwich Mean Time (Universal Time) and, therefore, may differ by as much as a day in other time zones.)
min The minimum number of days required between password changes for username.
max The maximum number of days the password is valid for username.
warn The number of days relative to max before the password expires that the username will be warned.
The use of nispasswd is strongly discouraged. It is a wrapper around the passwd(1) command.
Using passwd(1) with the -r nisplus option will achieve the same result and will be consistent across all the differ<hy>
ent name services available. This is the recommended way to change the password in NIS+.
The login program, file access display programs (for example, ls -l), and network programs that require user pass<hy>
words, for example, rlogin(1), ftp(1), and so on, use the standard getpwnam(3C) and getspnam(3C) interfaces to
get password information. These programs will get the NIS+ password information, which is modified by nispass<hy>
wd, only if the passwd: entry in the /etc/nsswitch.conf file includes nisplus. See nsswitch.conf(4) for more de<hy>
tails.
The following options are supported:
-a Shows the password attributes for all entries. This will show only the entries in the NIS+ passwd table in the local
domain that the invoker is authorized to "read".
-d [username] Displays password attributes for the caller or the user specified if the invoker has the right privileges.
-D domainname Consults the passwd.org_dir table in domainname. If this option is not specified, the default do<hy>
mainname returned by nis_local_directory() will be used. This domainname is the same as that returned by do<hy>
mainname(1M).
-f Forces the user to change password at the next login by expiring the password for username.
-g Changes the gecos (finger) information.
-h Changes the home directory.
-l Locks the password entry for username. Subsequently, login(1) would disallow logins with this NIS+ password
entry.
-n min Sets minimum field for username. The min field contains the minimum number of days between password
changes for username. If min is greater than max, the user may not change the password. Always use this option
with the -x option, unless max is set to -1 (aging turned off). In that case, min need not be set.
-s Changes the login shell. By default, only the NIS+ administrator can change the login shell. The user will be
prompted for the new login shell.
-w warn Sets warn field for username. The warn field contains the number of days before the password expires that
the user will be warned whenever he or she attempts to login.
<beginning of page>
-x max Sets maximum field for username. The max field contains the number of days that the password is valid for
username. The aging for username will be turned off immediately if max is set to -1. If it is set to 0, then the user is
forced to change the password at the next login session and aging is turned off.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Success.
1 Permission denied.
2 Invalid combination of options.
3 Unexpected failure. NIS+ passwd table unchanged.
4 NIS+ passwd table missing.
5 NIS+ is busy. Try again later.
6 Invalid argument to option.
7 Aging is disabled.
8 No memory.
9 System error.
10 Account expired.

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
NIS+ to LDAP are available in the current Solaris release. For more information, visit http://www.sun.com/directo<hy>
