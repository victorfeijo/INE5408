#include <sys/reboot.h>
int reboot(int howto, char *bootargs);
The reboot() function reboots the system. The howto argument specifies the behavior of the system while rebooting
and is a mask constructed by a bitwise-inclusive-OR of flags from the following list:
RB_AUTOBOOT The machine is rebooted from the root filesystem on the default boot device. This is the default
behavior. See boot(1M) and kernel(1M).
RB_HALT The processor is simply halted; no reboot takes place. This option should be used with caution.
RB_ASKNAME Interpreted by the bootstrap program and kernel, causing the user to be asked for pathnames dur<hy>
ing the bootstrap.
RB_DUMP The system is forced to panic immediately without any further processing and a crash dump is written
to the dump device (see dumpadm(1M)) before rebooting.
Any other howto argument causes the kernel file to boot.
The interpretation of the bootargs argument is platform-dependent.
Upon successful completion, reboot() never returns. Otherwise, <mi>1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
The reboot() function will fail if:
EPERM The {PRIV_SYS_CONFIG} privilege is not asserted in the effective set of the calling process.
