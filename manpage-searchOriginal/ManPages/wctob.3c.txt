wctob <-> wide-character to single-byte conversion
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>
int wctob(wint_t c);
The wctob() function determines whether c corresponds to a member of the extended character set whose character
representation is a single byte when in the initial shift state.
The behavior of this function is affected by the LC_CTYPE category of the current locale. See environ(5)
The wctob() function returns EOF if c does not correspond to a character with length one in the initial shift state.
Otherwise, it returns the single-byte representation of that character.
No errors are defined.

The wctob() function can be used safely in multithreaded applications, as long as setlocale(3C) is not being called to
change the locale.
