isainfo <-> describe instruction set architectures
isainfo [ [-v] [-b | -n | -k] | [-x]]
The isainfo utility is used to identify various attributes of the instruction set architectures supported on the currently
running system. Among the questions it can answer are whether 64-bit applications are supported, or whether the
running kernel uses 32-bit or 64-bit device drivers.
When invoked with no options, isainfo prints the names of the native instruction sets for applications supported by
the current version of the operating system. These are a subset of the list returned by isalist(1). The subset corre<hy>
sponds to the basic applications environments supported by the currently running system.
The following options are supported:
-b Prints the number of bits in the address space of the native instruction set.
-k Prints the name of the instruction set(s) used by the operating system kernel components such as device drivers
and STREAMS modules.
-n Prints the name of the native instruction set used by portable applications supported by the current version of the
operating system.
-v When used with the -b, -k or -n options, prints more detailed information.
-x Prints instruction extensions to the native ABI which are supported by the platform.
Example 1 Invoking isainfo on a 32-bit x86 Platform
The following example invokes isainfo on a 32-bit x86 platform:
 example% isainfo -v
 32-bit i386 applications
 example% isainfo -k
 i386
Example 2 Invoking isainfo on a System Running the 64-bit Operating System on a 64-bit SPARC Processor
The following example invokes isainfo on a system running the 64-bit operating system on a 64-bit SPARC proces<hy>
sor:
 example% isainfo
 sparcv9 sparc
 example% isainfo -n
 sparcv9
 example% isainfo -v
 64-bit sparcv9 applications
 32-bit sparc applications
 example% isainfo -vk

Example 3 Invoking isainfo -x on an AMD Opteron CPU
The following example invokes isainfo with the -x option on an AMD Opteron CPU:
 example% isainfo -x
