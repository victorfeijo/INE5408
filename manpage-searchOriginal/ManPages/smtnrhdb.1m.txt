smtnrhdb <-> manage entries in the tnrhdb database
/usr/sadm/bin/smtnrhdb subcommand [auth_args] -- subcommand_args]
The smtnrhdb command adds, modifies, deletes, and lists entries in the tnrhdb database.
The tnrhdb database specifies which remote-host template to use for each host, including the local host, in the dis<hy>
tributed system. If a host's IP address cannot be matched to some entry in the tnrhdb database, communication
with the host is not permitted.
The smtnrhdb command requires the Solaris Management Console to be initialized for the command to succeed
(see smc(1M)). After rebooting the Solaris Management Console server, the first smc connection can time out, so
you might need to retry the command.
The trusted network software uses a network "longest prefix of matching bits" mechanism when looking for a host.
The software looks first for the IP address of the host. If the software does not find this address, then the software
falls back to searching for an IP address with the longest prefix of a matching bit pattern, and so on. Note -
The actual numeric value of the subnet address or other subnetting information on the system (for example, from
the netmasks(4) file) are not considered by this mechanism.
Using the "longest prefix of matching bits" mechanism, an IPv4 address of 0.0.0.0 is a wildcard address with a prefix
length of 0 and hence matches any IPv4 address. For more information about prefi x lengths in IPv4 and IPv6 ad<hy>
dresses, see System Administration Guide: IP Services.
The smtnrhdb command accepts a hostname, IP address, and wildcard address with as optional prefix as valid ad<hy>
dresses. See subcommand_args, below, for the format of valid addresses.
smtnrhdb subcommands are:
add
Adds a new entry to the tnrhdb database. To add an entry, the administrator must have the solaris.net<hy>
work.host.write and solaris.network.security.write authorizations.
delete
Deletes an entry from the tnrhdb database. To delete an entry, the administrator must have the solaris.net<hy>
work.host.write and solaris.network.security.write authorizations.
list
Lists all entries in the tnrhdb database. To list an entry, the administrator must have the solaris.network.host.read
and solaris.network.security.read authorizations.
modify
Modifies an entry in the tnrhdb database. To modify an entry, the administrator must have the solaris.net<hy>
work.host.write and solaris.network.security.write authorizations.
The smtnrhdb authentication arguments, auth_args, are derived from the smc arg set. These arguments are the same
regardless of which subcommand you use.
The subcommand-specific options, subcommand_args, must be preceded by the -- option.
The valid auth_args are -D, -H, -l, -p, -r, and -u; they are all optional. If no auth_args are specified, certain defaults
will be assumed and the user might be prompted for additional information, such as a password for authentication
purposes. These letter options can also be specified by their equivalent option words preceded by a double dash. For
example, you can use either -D or --domain.
-D | --domain domain
Specifies the default domain that you want to manage. The syntax of domain=type:/host_name/domain_name, where
type is dns, ldap, or file; host_name is the name of the server; and domain_name is the name of the domain you
<beginning of page>
want to manage.
If you do not specify this option, the Solaris Management Console assumes the file default domain on whatever
server you choose to manage, meaning that changes are local to the server. Toolboxes can change the domain on a
tool-by-tool basis; this option specifies the domain for all other tools.
-H | --hostname host_name:port
Specifies the host_name and port to which you want to connect. If you do not specify a port, the system connects to
the default port, 898. If you do not specify host_name:port, the Solaris Management Console connects to the local
host on port 898.
-l | --rolepassword role_password
Specifies the password for the role_name. If you specify a role_name but do not specify a role_password, the system
prompts you to supply a role_password. Passwords specified on the command line can be seen by any user on the
system, hence this option is considered insecure.
-p | --password password
Specifies the password for the user_name. If you do not specify a password, the system prompts you for one. Pass<hy>
words specified on the command line can be seen by any user on the system, hence this option is considered inse<hy>
cure.
-r | --rolename role_name
Specifies a role name for authentication. If you do not specify this option, no role is assumed.
-u | --username user_name
Specifies the user name for authentication. If you do not specify this option, the user identity running the console
process is assumed.
--
This option is required and must always follow the preceding options. If you do not enter the preceding options, you
must still enter the -- option.
Note: Descriptions and other arg options that contain white spaces must be enclosed in double quotes.
-h
Displays the command's usage statement.
-H hostname
Specifies the name of the host. For the list subcommand, the hostname argument is not specified. This is not required
if the ipaddress subcommand argument is specified.
-i ipaddress
Specifies the IP address of the host. This is not required if the hostname subcommand argument is specified. This
option is not valid with the -w option.
-n templatename
Specifies the name of an existing template.
<beginning of page>
-p prefixlen
Specifies the prefix length (in bits) of a wildcard representation of the IP address. The prefix is the left-most portion
of the IP address. This option is valid only with the -w option. For example, when the value of -w ipaddress-wild<hy>
card is 192.168.0.0, a prefixlen value of 24 indicates that the wildcard matches all addresses on the 192.168.0 net<hy>
work. With a prefixlen of 32, the wildcard 192.168.0.0 matches all addresses on the 192.168.0.0 network.
-w ipaddress-wildcard
Specifies the IP address of the subnet using a wildcard.
<bu> One of the following sets of arguments must be specified for subcommand add:
 -H hostname -n templatename |
 -i ipaddress -n templatename |
 -w ipaddress-wildcard -n templatename [ -p prefixlen ] |
 -h
<bu> One of the following sets of arguments must be specified for subcommand modify:
 -H hostname -n templatename |
 -i ipaddress -n templatename |
 -w ipaddress-wildcard -n templatename [ -p prefixlen ] |
 -h
<bu> One of the following sets of arguments must be specified for subcommand delete:
 -H hostname |
 -i ipaddress |
 -w ipaddress-wildcard [ -p prefixlen ] |
 -h
<bu> The subcommand list takes the following argument:
 -h
Example 1 Specifying the Template Name for a Wildcard IP Address
The admin role specifies the template name, cipso_lan, for a series of hosts that use the IP address wildcard
192.168.113.0 on the local file system. Since no authorization arguments were specified, the administrator connects
to port 898 of the local host on the local server with the file domain type, which are the defaults. The administrator is
prompted for the admin password.
 $ usr/sadm/bin/smtnrhdb add -- -w 192.168.113.0 -n cipso_lan
Example 2 Deleting an Entry in the tnrhdb Database
The admin role connects to port 898 (which happens to be the default) of the LDAP server and deletes a host entry
from the database by specifying its IP address, 192.168.113.8. Since the domain was not specified, the file domain
type and local server are used by default. The administrator is prompted for the admin password.
 # /usr/sadm/bin/smtnrhdb delete -D ldap:/example.domain -i 192.168.113.8
Example 3 Adding a Subnet to the tnrhdb Database
The following command adds all the addresses on the 192.168.55.0 subnet, from 192.168.55.1 to 192.168.55.255, to
the tnrhdb database:
<beginning of page>
 # /usr/sadm/bin/smtnrhdb add \
 -D file:/machine1.ExampleCo.COM/machine1.ExampleCo.COM \
  -- -w 192.168.55.0 -n cipso

Example 4 Adding Subnet 192.168.0 to the tnrhdb Database
The following command adds all the addresses on the 192.168.0 subnet, from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.255 to the
tnrhdb database. The prefix, 24, indicates that the first 24 bits (192.168.0) are fixed. Only the final zero is a wild<hy>
card.
 # /usr/sadm/bin/smtnrhdb add \
 -D file:/machine1.ExampleCo.COM/machine1.ExampleCo.COM \
  -- -w 192.168.0.0 -p 24 -n cipso
