The dhcpconfig command is used to configure and manage the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) ser<hy>
vice or BOOTP relay services. It is intended for use by experienced Solaris system administrators and is designed
for ease of use in scripts. The dhcpmgr utility is recommended for less experienced administrators or those prefer<hy>
ring a graphical utility to configure and manage the DHCP service or BOOTP relay service.
The dhcpconfig command can be run by root, or by other users assigned to the DHCP Management profile. See
rbac(5) and user_attr(4).
dhcpconfig requires one of the following function flags: -D, -R, -U, -N, -C, -X, -I, -P or -S.
The dhcpconfig menu driven mode is supported in Solaris 8 and previous versions of Solaris.
dhcpconfig scans various configuration files on your Solaris machine for information it can use to assign values to
options contained in macros it adds to the dhcptab configuration table. The following table lists information dhcp<hy>
config needs, the source used, and how the information is used:
tab() box; lw(1.38i) |lw(2.06i) |lw(2.06i) lw(1.38i) |lw(2.06i) |lw(2.06i) InformationSourceWhere Used _ Time<hy>
zoneSystem date, timezone settingsLocale macro DNS parametersnsswitch.conf, /etc/resolv.confServer macro NIS
parametersSystem domainname, nsswitch.conf, NISNetwork macros SubnetmaskT{ Network interface, netmasks
table in nameservice T}Network macros
If you have not set these parameters on your server machine, you should do so before configuring the DHCP server
with dhcpconfig. Note that if you specify options with the dhcpconfig -D command line, the values you supply
override the values obtained from the system files.
The following options are supported:
-C Convert to using a new data store, recreating the DHCP data tables in a format appropriate to the new data store,
and setting up the DHCP server to use the new data store.
The following sub-options are required:
-p path_to_data The paths for SUNWfiles and SUNWbinfiles must be absolute UNIX pathnames. The path for
SUNWnisplus must be a fully specified NIS+ directory (including the tailing period.) See dhcp_modules(5).
<beginning of page>
-r data_resource New data store resource. One of the following must be specified: SUNWfiles, SUNWbinfiles, or
SUNWnisplus. See dhcp_modules(5).
The following sub-options are optional:
-f Do not prompt for confirmation. If -f is not used, a warning and confirmation prompt are issued before the conver<hy>
sion starts.
-k Keep the old DHCP data tables after successful conversion. If any problem occurs during conversion, tables are
not deleted even if -k sub-option is not specified.
-u uninterpreted Data which is ignored by dhcpconfig, but passed on to the datastore for interpretation. The private
layer provides for module-specific configuration information through the use of the RESOURCE_CONFIG
keyword. Uninterpreted data is stored within RESOURCE_CONFIG keyword of dhcpsvc.conf(4). The -u sub-op<hy>
tion is not used with the SUNWfiles, SUNWbinfiles, and SUNWnisplus data stores. See dhcp_modules(5).
-D Configure the DHCP service.
The following sub-options are required:
-r data_resource One of the following must be specified: SUNWfiles, SUNWbinfiles, or SUNWnisplus. Other data
stores may be available.See dhcp_modules(5).
-p path The paths for SUNWfiles and SUNWbinfiles must be absolute UNIX pathnames. The path for SUNWnis<hy>
plus must be a fully specified NIS+ directory (including the tailing period.) . See dhcp_modules(5).
The following sub-options are optional:
-a DNS_servers IP addresses of DNS servers, separated with commas.
-d DNS_domain DNS domain name.
-h hosts_resource Resource in which to place hosts data. Usually, the name service in use on the server. Valid values
are nisplus, files, or dns.
-l seconds Lease length used for addresses not having a specified lease length, in seconds.
-n Non-negotiable leases
-y hosts_domain DNS or NIS+ domain name to be used for hosts data. Valid only if dns or nisplus is specified for
-h sub-option.
-u uninterpreted Data which is ignored by dhcpconfig, but passed on to the datastore for interpretation. The private
layer provides for module-specific configuration information through the use of the RESOURCE_CONFIG
keyword. Uninterpreted data is stored within RESOURCE_CONFIG keyword of dhcpsvc.conf(4). The -u sub-op<hy>
tion is not used with the SUNWfiles, SUNWbinfiles, and SUNWnisplus data stores. See dhcp_modules(5).
-I filename Import data from filename, containing data previously exported from a Solaris DHCP server. Note that
after importing, you may have to edit macros to specify the correct domain names, and edit network tables to change
the owning server of addresses in imported networks. Use dhtadm and pntadm to do this.
The following sub-options are supported:
<beginning of page>
-f Replace any conflicting data with the data being imported.
-g Signal the daemon to reload the dhcptab once the import has been completed.
-N net_address Configure an additional network for DHCP service.
The following sub-options are supported:
-a NIS_server_addresses List of IP addresses of NIS servers.
-b Network is a point-to-point (PPP) network, therefore no broadcast address should be configured. If -b is not used,
the network is assumed to be a LAN, and the broadcast address is determined using the network address and subnet
mask.
-g Signal the daemon to reload the dhcptab.
-m xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx Subnet mask for the network; if -m is not used, subnet mask is obtained from netmasks.
-t router_addresses List of router IP addresses; if not specified, router discovery flag is set.
-y NIS_domain_name If NIS is used on this network, specify the NIS domain name.
-P Configure the DHCP service parameters. Each parameter and value are specified by the following pattern:
 parameter[=value],...
Where parameter and value are:
parameter One of the DHCP service parameters listed in dhcpsvc.conf(4). If the corresponding value is not speci<hy>
fied, the current parameter value is displayed. If parameter is not specified, all parameters and current values are dis<hy>
played.
value Optional string to set the servers parameter to if the value is acceptable. If the value is missing or is empty
(""), the parameter and its current value are deleted.
After a parameter has changed the DHCP server requires re-starting before you can use new parameter values.
-R server_addresses Configure the BOOTP relay service. BOOTP or DHCP requests are forwarded to the list of
servers specified.
server_addresses is a comma separated list of hostnames and/or IP addresses.
-S Control the DHCP service.
The following sub-options are supported:
-d
 Disable and stop the DHCP service.
-e Enable and start the DHCP service.
<beginning of page>
-q Display the state of the DHCP service. The state is encoded into the exit status.
 0 DHCP service disabled and stopped
 1 DHCP service enabled and stopped
 2 DHCP service disabled and running
 3 DHCP service enabled and running
-r Enable and restart the DHCP service.
-U Unconfigure the DHCP service or BOOTP relay service.
The following sub-options are supported:
-f Do not prompt for confirmation. If -f is not used, a warning and confirmation prompt is issued.
-h Delete hosts entries from name service.
-x Delete the dhcptab and network tables.
-X filename Export data from the DHCP data tables, saving to filename, to move the data to another Solaris DHCP
server.
The following sub-options are optional:
-a networks_to_export List of networks whose addresses should be exported, or the keyword ALL to specify all net<hy>
works. If -a is not specified, no networks are exported.
-g Signal the daemon to reload the dhcptab after the export has been completed.
-m macros_to_export List of macros to export, or the keyword ALL to specify all macros. If -m is not specified, no
macros are exported.
-o options_to_export List of options to export, or the keyword ALL to specify all options. If -o is not specified, no
options are exported.
-x Delete the data from this server after it is exported. If -x is not specified you are in effect copying the data.
