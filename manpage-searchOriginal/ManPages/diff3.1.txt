diff3 <-> 3-way differential file comparison
diff3 [-exEX3] filename1 filename2 filename3
diff3 compares three versions of a file. It publishes disagreeing ranges of text flagged with the following codes:
==== all three files differ
====1 filename1is different
====2 filename2is different
====3 filename3is different
The type of change suffered in converting a given range of a given file to some other is indicated in one of the fol<hy>
lowing ways:
f : n1 a Text is to be appended after line number n1 in file f, where f = 1, 2, or 3.
f : n1 , n2 c Text is to be changed in the range line n1 to line n2. If n1 = n2, the range can be abbreviated to n1.
The original contents of the range follows immediately after a c indication. When the contents of two files are identi<hy>
cal, the contents of the lower-numbered file is suppressed.
The following command applies the resulting script to filename1.
 (cat script; echo a<aa>1,$pa<aa>) | ed <mi> filename1
The following options are supported:
-e Produce a script for the ed(1) editor that incorporates into filename1 all changes between filename2 and filename3
(that is, the changes that normally would be flagged ==== and ====3).
Text lines that consist of a single dot (. defeat the -e option.
-E Produce a script that incorporates all changes between filename2 and filename3, but treat overlapping changes
(that is, changes that would be flagged with ==== in the normal listing) differently. The overlapping lines from both
files are inserted by the edit script, bracketed by <<<<<< and >>>>>> lines.
-x Produce a script to incorporate only changes flagged ====.
-X Produce a script that incorporates only changes flagged ====, but treat these changes in the manner of the -E op<hy>
tion.
-3 Produce a script to incorporate only changes flagged ====3.
See largefile(5) for the description of the behavior of diff3 when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte
( 2^31 bytes).
