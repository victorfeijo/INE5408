 database
ldapaddent creates entries in LDAP containers from their corresponding /etc files. This operation is customized for
each of the standard containers that are used in the administration of Solaris systems. The database argument speci<hy>
fies the type of the data being processed. Legal values for this type are one of aliases, auto_*, bootparams, ethers,
group, hosts (including both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses), ipnodes (alias for hosts), netgroup, netmasks, networks,
passwd, shadow, protocols, publickey, rpc, and services. In addition to the preceding, the database argument can
be one of the RBAC-related files (see rbac(5)): <bu> /etc/user_attr <bu> /etc/security/auth_attr <bu> /etc/security/prof_attr <bu>
/etc/security/exec_attr
By default, ldapaddent reads from the standard input and adds this data to the LDAP container associated with the
database specified on the command line. An input file from which data can be read is specified using the -f option.
If you specify the -h option, ldapaddent establishes a connection to the server indicated by the option in order to
obtain a DUAProfile specified by the -N option. The entries will be stored in the directory described by the configu<hy>
ration obtained.
By default (if the -h option is not specified), entries will be stored in the directory based on the client's configura<hy>
tion. To use the utility in the default mode, the Solaris LDAP client must be set up in advance.
The location where entries are to be written can be overridden by using the -b option.
If the entry to be added exists in the directory, the command displays an error and exits, unless the -c option is used.
Although, there is a shadow database type, there is no corresponding shadow container. Both the shadow and the
passwd data is stored in the people container itself. Similarly, data from networks and netmasks databases are
stored in the networks container.
The user_attr and audit_user data is stored by default in the people container. The prof_attr and exec_attr data is
stored by default in the SolarisProfAttr container.
You must add entries from the passwd database before you attempt to add entries from the shadow database. The
addition of a shadow entry that does not have a corresponding passwd entry will fail.
The passwd database must precede both the user_attr and audit_user databases.
For better performance, the recommended order in which the databases should be loaded is as follows: <bu> passwd
database followed by shadow database <bu> networks database followed by netmasks database <bu> bootparams database
followed by ethers database
Only the first entry of a given type that is encountered will be added to the LDAP server. The ldapaddent command
skips any duplicate entries.

The ldapaddent command supports the following options:
-a authenticationMethod
Specify authentication method. The default value is what has been configured in the profile. The supported authenti<hy>
cation methods are: <bu> simple <bu> sasl/CRAM-MD5 <bu> sasl/DIGEST-MD5 <bu> sasl/GSSAPI <bu> tls:simple <bu>
tls:sasl/CRAM-MD5 <bu> tls:sasl/DIGEST-MD5 Selecting simple causes passwords to be sent over the network in
clear text. Its use is strongly discouraged. Additionally, if the client is configured with a profile which uses no au<hy>
thentication, that is, either the credentialLevel attribute is set to anonymous or authenticationMethod is set to
none, the user must use this option to provide an authentication method. If the authentication method is sasl/GSS<hy>
API, bindDN and bindPassword is not required and the hosts and ipnodes fields of /etc/nsswitch.conf must be con<hy>
figured as:
 hosts: dns files
 ipnodes: dns files
See nsswitch.conf(4).
-b baseDN
Create entries in the baseDN directory. baseDN is not relative to the client's default search base, but rather. it is the
actual location where the entries will be created. If this parameter is not specified, the first search descriptor defined
for the service or the default container will be used.
-c
Continue adding entries to the directory even after an error. Entries will not be added if the directory server is not re<hy>
sponding or if there is an authentication problem.
-D bindDN
Create an entry which has write permission to the baseDN. When used with -d option, this entry only needs read
permission.
-d
Dump the LDAP container to the standard output in the appropriate format for the given database.
-f filename
Indicates input file to read in an /etc/ file format.
-h LDAP_server[:serverPort]
Specify an address (or a name) and an optional port of the LDAP server in which the entries will be stored. The cur<hy>
rent naming service specified in the nsswitch.conf file is used. The default value for the port is 389, except when
TLS is specified as the authentication method. In this case, the default LDAP server port number is 636.
-j passwdFile
Specify a file containing the password for the bind DN or the password for the SSL client's key database. To protect
the password, use this option in scripts and place the password in a secure file. This option is mutually exclusive of
the -w option.
-M domainName
The name of a domain served by the specified server. If not specified, the default domain name will be used.
<beginning of page>
-N profileName
Specify the DUAProfile name. A profile with such a name is supposed to exist on the server specified by -h option.
Otherwise, a default DUAProfile will be used. The default value is default.
-P certifPath
The certificate path for the location of the certificate database. The value is the path where security database files re<hy>
side. This is used for TLS support, which is specified in the authenticationMethod and serviceAuthentication<hy>
Method attributes. The default is /var/ldap.
-p
Process the password field when loading password information from a file. By default, the password field is ig<hy>
nored because it is usually not valid, as the actual password appears in a shadow file.
-w bindPassword
Password to be used for authenticating the bindDN. If this parameter is missing, the command will prompt for a
password. NULL passwords are not supported in LDAP.
When you use -w bindPassword to specify the password to be used for authentication, the password is visible to oth<hy>
er users of the system by means of the ps command, in script files or in shell history.
If you supply "-" (hyphen) as a password, you will be prompted to enter a password.
-v
Verbose.
The following operands are supported:
database
The name of the database or service name. Supported values are: aliases, auto_*, bootparams, ethers, group, hosts
(including IPv6 addresses), netgroup, netmasks, networks, passwd, shadow, protocols, publickey, rpc, and ser<hy>
vices. Also supported are auth_attr, prof_attr, exec_attr, user_attr, and projects.
Example 1 Adding Password Entries to the Directory Server
The following example shows how to add password entries to the directory server:
 example# ldapaddent -D "cn=directory manager" -w secret \
  -f /etc/passwd passwd
Example 2 Adding Group Entries
The following example shows how to add group entries to the directory server using sasl/CRAM-MD5 as the au<hy>
thentication method:
 example# ldapaddent -D "cn=directory manager" -w secret \
  -a "sasl/CRAM-MD5" -f /etc/group group
Example 3 Adding auto_master Entries
The following example shows how to add auto_master entries to the directory server:
 example# ldapaddent -D "cn=directory manager" -w secret \
  -f /etc/auto_master auto_master
<beginning of page>
Example 4 Dumping passwd Entries from the Directory to File
The following example shows how to dump password entries from the directory to a file foo:
 example# ldapaddent -d passwd > foo
Example 5 Adding Password Entries to a Specific Directory Server
The following example shows how to add password entries to a directory server that you specify:
 example# ldapaddent -h 10.10.10.10:3890 \
 -M another.domain.name -N special_duaprofile \
 -D "cn=directory manager" -w secret \
 -f /etc/passwd passwd
The following exit values are returned:
0
Successful completion.
>0
An error occurred.

/var/ldap/ldap_client_cred

Currently StartTLS is not supported by libldap.so.5, therefore the port number provided refers to the port used dur<hy>
ing a TLS open, rather than the port used as part of a StartTLS sequence. For example:
 -h foo:1000 -a tls:simple
The preceding refers to a raw TLS open on host foo port 1000, not an open, StartTLS sequence on an unsecured port
1000. If port 1000 is unsecured the connection will not be made.
