The erasechar() function returns the current ERASE character from the tty driver. This character is used to delete
the previous character during keyboard input. The returned value can be used when including deletion capability in
interactive programs.
The killchar() function is similar to erasechar(). It returns the current KILL character.
The erasewchar() and killwchar() functions are similar to erasechar() and killchar() respectively, but store the
ERASE or KILL character in the object pointed to by ch.
ch Is a pointer to a location where a character may be stored.
For erasechar() and killchar(), the terminal's current ERASE or KILL character is returned.
On success, the erasewchar() and killwchar() functions return OK. Otherwise, they return ERR.
