ustat <-> get file system statistics
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <ustat.h>
int ustat(dev_t dev, struct ustat *buf);
The ustat() function returns information about a mounted file system. The dev argument is a device number identi<hy>
fying a device containing a mounted file system (see makedev(3C)). The buf argument is a pointer to a ustat struc<hy>
ture that includes the following members:
 daddr_t f_tfree; /* Total free blocks */
 ino_t f_tinode; /* Number of free inodes */
 char f_fname[6]; /* Filsys name */
 char f_fpack[6]; /* Filsys pack name */
The f_fname and f_fpack members may not contain significant information on all systems; in this case, these mem<hy>
bers will contain the null character as the first character.
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. Otherwise, <mi>1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
The ustat() function will fail if:
ECOMM The dev argument is on a remote machine and the link to that machine is no longer active.
EFAULT The buf argument points to an illegal address.
EINTR A signal was caught during the execution of the ustat() function.
EINVAL The dev argument is not the device number of a device containing a mounted file system.
ENOLINK The dev argument refers to a device on a remote machine and the link to that machine is no longer ac<hy>
tive.
EOVERFLOW One of the values returned cannot be represented in the structure pointed to by buf.
The statvfs(2) function should be used in favor of ustat().
stat(2), statvfs(2), makedev(3C), lfcompile(5)
The NFS revision 2 protocol does not permit the number of free files to be provided to the client; therefore, when
ustat() has completed on an NFS file system, f_tinode is always <mi>1.
