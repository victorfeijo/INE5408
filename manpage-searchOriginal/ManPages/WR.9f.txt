WR, wr <-> get pointer to the write queue for this module or driver
#include <sys/stream.h>
#include <sys/ddi.h>
queue_t *WR(queue_t *q);
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI).
q Pointer to the read queue whose write queue is to be returned.
The WR() function accepts a read queue pointer as an argument and returns a pointer to the write queue of the same
module.
CAUTION: Make sure the argument to this function is a pointer to a read queue. WR() will not check for queue
type, and a system panic could result if the pointer is not to a read queue.
The pointer to the write queue.
The WR() function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context. Example 1 Using WR()
In a STREAMS close(9E) routine, the driver or module is passed a pointer to the read queue. These usually are set
to the address of the module-specific data structure for the minor device.
