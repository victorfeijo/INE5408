DAT_RETURN
 dat_ep_modify (
 IN DAT_EP_HANDLE ep_handle,
 IN DAT_EP_PARAM_MASK ep_param_mask,
 IN DAT_EP_PARAM *ep_param
 )
ep_handle Handle for an instance of the Endpoint.
ep_param_mask Mask for Endpoint parameters.
ep_param Pointer to the Consumer-allocated structure that contains Consumer-requested Endpoint parameters.
The dat_ep_modify() function provides the Consumer a way to change parameters of an Endpoint.
The ep_param_mask parameter allows Consumers to specify which parameters to modify. Providers modify values
for ep_param_mask requested parameters only.
Not all the parameters of the Endpoint can be modified. Some can be modified only when the Endpoint is in a spe<hy>
cific state. The following list specifies which parameters can be modified and when they can be modified.
Interface Adapter
Cannot be modified.
Endpoint belongs to an open instance of IA and that association cannot be changed.
Endpoint State
Cannot be modified.
State of Endpoint cannot be changed by a dat_ep_modify() operation.
Local IA Address
Cannot be modified.
Local IA Address cannot be changed by a dat_ep_modify() operation.
Local Port Qualifier
Cannot be modified.
Local port qualifier cannot be changed by a dat_ep_modify() operation.
Remote IA Address
Cannot be modified.
Remote IA Address cannot be changed by a dat_ep_modify() operation.
Remote Port Qualifier
Cannot be modified.
Remote port qualifier cannot be changed by a dat_ep_modify() operation

Protection Zone
Can be modified when in Quiescent, Unconnected, and Tentative Connection Pending states.
Protection Zone can be changed only when the Endpoint is in quiescent state. The only Endpoint states that isare
quiescent isare DAT_EP_STATE_UNCONNECTED and DAT_EP_STATE_TENTATIVE_CONNEC<hy>
TION_PENDING. Consumers should be aware that any Receive DTOs currently posted to the Endpoint that do not
match the new Protection Zone fail with a DAT_PROTECTION_VIOLATION return.
In DTO Event Dispatcher
Can be modified when in Unconnected, Reserved, Passive Connection Request Pending, and Tentative Connection
Pending states.
Event Dispatcher for incoming DTOs (Receive) can be changed only prior to a request for a connection for an Ac<hy>
tive side or prior to accepting a Connection Request for a Passive side.
Out DTO Event Dispatcher
Can be modified when in Unconnected, Reserved, Passive Connection Pending, and Tentative Connection Pending
states.
Event Dispatcher for outgoing DTOs (Send, RDMA Read, and RDMA Write) can be changed only prior to a request
for a connection for an Active side or prior to accepting a Connection Request for a Passive side.
Connection Event Dispatcher
Can be modified when in Unconnected, Reserved, Passive Connection Pending, and Tentative Connection Pending
states.
Event Dispatcher for the Endpoint Connection events can be changed only prior to a request for a connection for an
Active side or accepting a Connection Request for a Passive side.
Service Type
Can be modified when in Unconnected, Reserved, Passive Connection Pending, and Tentative Connection Pending
states.
Service Type can be changed only prior to a request for a connection for an Active side or accepting a Connection
Request for a Passive side.
Maximum Message Size
Can be modified when in Unconnected, Reserved, Passive Connection Request Pending, and Tentative Connection
Pending states.
Maximum Message Size can be changed only prior to a request for a connection for an Active side or accepting a
Connection Request for a Passive side.
Maximum RDMA Size
Can be modified when in Unconnected, Reserved, Passive Connection Pending, and Tentative Connection Pending
states.
Maximum RDMA Size can be changed only prior to a request for a connection for an Active side or accepting a
Connection Request for a Passive side.
Quality of Service
Can be modified when in Unconnected, Reserved, Passive Connection Pending, and Tentative Connection Pending
states.
<beginning of page>
QoS can be changed only prior to a request for a connection for an Active side or accepting a Connection Request
for a Passive side.
Recv Completion Flags
Can be modified when in Unconnected, Reserved, Passive Connection Pending, and Tentative Connection Pending
states.
Recv Completion Flags specifies what DTO flags the Endpoint should support for Receive DTO operations. The val<hy>
ue can be DAT_COMPLETION_NOTIFICATION_SUPPRESS_FLAG, DAT_COMPLETION_SOLICIT<hy>
ED_WAIT_FLAG, or DAT_COMPLETION_EVD_THRESHOLD_FLAG. Recv posting does not support
DAT_COMPLETION_SUPPRESS_FLAG or DAT_COMPLETION_BARRIER_FENCE_FLAG dat_comple<hy>
tion_flags values that are only applicable to Request postings. Recv Completion Flags can be changed only prior to a
request for a connection for an Active side or accepting a Connection Request for a Passive side, but before posting
of any Recvs.
Request Completion Flags
Can be modified when in Unconnected, Reserved, Passive Connection Request Pending, and Tentative Connection
Pending states.
Request Completion Flags specifies what DTO flags the Endpoint should support for Send, RDMA Read, RDMA
Write, and RMR Bind operations. The value can be: DAT_COMPLETION_UNSIGNALLED_FLAG or
DAT_COMPLETION_EVD_THRESHOLD_FLAG. Request postings always support DAT_COMPLE<hy>
TION_SUPPRESS_FLAG, DAT_COMPLETION_SOLICITED_WAIT_FLAG, or DAT_COMPLE<hy>
TION_BARRIER_FENCE_FLAG completion_flags values. Request Completion Flags can be changed only prior
to a request for a connection for an Active side or accepting a Connection Request for a Passive side.
Maximum Recv DTO
Can be modified when in Unconnected, Reserved, Passive Connection Pending, and Tentative Connection Pending
states.
Maximum Recv DTO specifies the maximum number of outstanding Consumer-submitted Receive DTOs that a
Consumer expects at any time at the Endpoint. Maximum Recv DTO can be changed only prior to a request for a
connection for an Active side or accepting a Connection Request for a Passive side.
Maximum Request DTO
Can be modified when in Unconnected, Reserved, Passive Connection Pending, and Tentative Connection Pending
states.
Maximum Request DTO specifies the maximum number of outstanding Consumer-submitted send and RDMA
DTOs and RMR Binds that a Consumer expects at any time at the Endpoint. Maximum Out DTO can be changed
only prior to a request for a connection for an Active side or accepting a Connection Request for a Passive side.
Maximum Recv IOV
Can be modified when in Unconnected, Reserved, Passive Connection Pending, and Tentative Connection Pending
states.
Maximum Recv IOV specifies the maximum number of elements in IOV that a Consumer specifies for posting a Re<hy>
ceive DTO for the Endpoint. Maximum Recv IOV can be changed only prior to a request for a connection for an Ac<hy>
tive side or accepting a Connection Request for a Passive side.
Maximum Request IOV
Can be modified when in Unconnected, Reserved, Passive Connection Pending, and Tentative Connection Pending
states.
Maximum Request IOV specifies the maximum number of elements in IOV that a Consumer specifies for posting a
Send, RDMA Read, or RDMA Write DTO for the Endpoint. Maximum Request IOV can be changed only prior to a
<beginning of page>
request for a connection for an Active side or accepting a Connection Request for a Passive side.

Num transport-specific attributes
Can be modified when in Quiescent (unconnected) state.
Number of transport-specific attributes to be modified.
Transport-specific endpoint attributes
Can be modified when in Quiescent (unconnected) state.
Transport-specific attributes can be modified only in the transport-defined Endpoint state. The only guaranteed safe
state in which to modify transport-specific Endpoint attributes is the quiescent state DAT_EP_STATE_UNCON<hy>
NECTED.

state in which to modify Provider-specific Endpoint attributes is the quiescent state DAT_EP_STATE_UNCON<hy>
NECTED.
DAT_SUCCESS The operation was successful.
DAT_INVALID_HANDLE The ep_handle parameter is invalid.
DAT_INVALID_PARAMETER The ep_param_mask parameter is invalid, or one of the requested Endpoint pa<hy>
rameters or attributes was invalid, not supported, or cannot be modified.
