/etc/mail/sendmail.cf
/etc/mail/submit.cf
The sendmail.cf and submit.cf files are the configuration files for sendmail(1M). Starting with version 8.12 of
sendmail, which was shipped with version 9 of the Solaris operating system, two configuration files are used for
submission and transmission of mail, instead of only sendmail.cf, as before. These are:
sendmail.cf Remains the principal sendmail configuration file. Used for the Mail Transmission Agent (MTA).
submit.cf Used for the Mail Submission Program (MSP). The MSP is used to submit mail messages. Unlike the
MTA, it does not run as an SMTP daemon.
The MSP does not require root privileges, thus the two-file model provides better security than the pre-sendmail
8.12 model, in which the MSP ran as a daemon and required root privileges.
In the default sendmail configuration, sendmail uses submit.cf, as indicated in ps(1) output. In ps output, you will
observe two sendmail invocations, such as the ones below:
 /usr/lib/sendmail -Ac -q15m
 /usr/lib/sendmail -bd -q15m
The first indicates the use of submit.cf, with the client queue (/var/spool/clientmqueue) being checked<em>and, if
needed, flushed<em>every 15 minutes. The second invocation runs sendmail as a daemon, waiting for incoming SMTP
connections.
As shipped, sendmail.cf and, in particular, submit.cf, are appropriate for most environments. Where a knowledge<hy>
able system administrator needs to make a change, he should use the following procedures.
For sendmail.cf: 1. Change directories to the directory that contains the source files for the configuration files.
 # cd /etc/mail/cf/cf
2. Create a copy of the sendmail file for your system.
 # cp sendmail.mc `hostname`.mc
3. Edit `hostname`.mc. Make changes suitable for your system and environment. 4. Run make to generate the
configuration file.
 # /usr/bin/make `hostname`.cf
5. Copy the newly generated file to its correct location.
 # cp `hostname`.cf /etc/mail/sendmail.cf
6. Restart the sendmail service.
 # svcadm restart sendmail
You must restart sendmail for sendmail.cf file changes to take effect, as indicated in step 6. Steps 4 - 6 can be auto<hy>
mated. See Automated Rebuilding of Configuration Files below.
For submit.cf: 1. Change directories to the directory that contains the source files for the configuration files.
<beginning of page>
 # cd /etc/mail/cf/cf
2. Create a copy of the submit file for your system.
 # cp submit.mc submit-`hostname`.mc
3. Edit submit-`hostname`.mc. Make changes suitable for your system and environment. 4. Run make to generate
the configuration file.
 # /usr/bin/make submit-`hostname`.cf
5. Copy the newly generated file to its correct location.
 # cp submit-`hostname`.cf /etc/mail/submit.cf
You do not need to restart sendmail for changes to submit.cf to take effect. Steps 4 and 5 can be automated. See
Automated Rebuilding of Configuration Files below.
The sendmail(1M) man page describes how the config/local_only property can be set to true or false to disallow or
allow, respectively, access to remote clients for unmodified systems.
Setting values for the following properties for the service instance svc:/network/smtp:sendmail results in automat<hy>
ed (re)building of configuration files:
 path_to_sendmail_mc
 path_to_submit_mc
The values for these properties should be strings which represent the path name of the .mc files referred to in steps 2
and 3 of both procedures above. Recommended values are:
 /etc/mail/cf/cf/`hostname`.mc
 /etc/mail/cf/cf/submit-`hostname`.mc
Each property, if set, results in the corresponding .mc file being used to (re)build the matching .cf file when the ser<hy>
vice is started.
These properties persist across upgrades and patches. To prevent a patch or upgrade from clobbering your .cf file, or
renaming it to .cf.old, you can set the desired properties instead.
