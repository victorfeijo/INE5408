rpc_gss_mech_to_oid, rpc_gss_qop_to_num <-> map mechanism, QOP strings to non-string values
#include <rpc/rpcsec_gss.h>
bool_t rpc_gss_mech_to_oid(charc*mech, rpc_gss_OIDc*oid);
bool_t rpc_gss_qop_to_num(char *qop, char *mech, u_int *num);
Because in-kernel RPC routines use non-string values for mechanism and Quality of Protection (QOP), these rou<hy>
tines exist to map strings for these attributes to their non-string counterparts. (The non-string values for QOP and
mechanism are also found in the /etc/gss/qop and /etc/gss/mech files, respectively.) rpc_gss_mech_to_oid() takes a
string representing a mechanism, as well as a pointer to a rpc_gss_OID object identifier structure. It then gives this
structure values corresponding to the indicated mechanism, so that the application can now use the OID directly with
RPC routines. rpc_gss_qop_to_num() does much the same thing, taking strings for QOP and mechanism and re<hy>
turning a number.
Information on RPCSEC_GSS data types for parameters may be found on the rpcsec_gss(3NSL) man page.
mech An ASCII string representing the security mechanism in use. Valid strings may be found in the /etc/gss/mech
file.
oid An object identifier of type rpc_gss_OID, whose elements are usable by kernel-level RPC routines.
qop This is an ASCII string which sets the quality of protection (QOP) for the session. Appropriate values for this
string may be found in the file /etc/gss/qop.
num The non-string value for the QOP.
Both functions return TRUE if they are successful, FALSE otherwise.
/etc/gss/mech File containing valid security mechanisms
/etc/gss/qop File containing valid QOP values
