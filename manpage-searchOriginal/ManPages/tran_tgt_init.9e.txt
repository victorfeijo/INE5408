tran_tgt_init <-> request to initialize HBA resources on behalf of a particular target

void prefixtran_tgt_init(dev_info_t *hba_dip, dev_info_t *tgt_dip,
 scsi_hba_tran_t *hba_tran, struct scsi_device *sd);
Solaris architecture specific (Solaris DDI).
hba_dip Pointer to a dev_info_t structure, referring to the HBA device instance.
tgt_dip Pointer to a dev_info_t structure, referring to the target device instance.
hba_tran Pointer to a scsi_hba_tran(9S) structure, consisting of the HBA's transport vectors.
sd Pointer to a scsi_device(9S) structure, describing the target.
The tran_tgt_init() vector in the scsi_hba_tran(9S) structure may be initialized during the HBA driver's at<hy>
tach(9E) to point to an HBA driver function to be called by the system when an instance of a target device is being
created. The tran_tgt_init() vector, if not NULL,is called after the dev_info node structure is created for this target
device instance, but before probe(9E) for this instance is called. Before receiving transport requests from the target
driver instance, the HBA may perform any initialization required for this particular target during the call of the
tran_tgt_init() vector.
Note that hba_tran will point to a cloned copy of the scsi_hba_tran_t structure allocated by the HBA driver if the
SCSI_HBA_TRAN_CLONE flag was specified in the call to scsi_hba_attach(9F). In this case, the HBA driver
may choose to initialize the tran_tgt_private field in the structure pointed to by hba_tran, to point to the data specif<hy>
ic to the particular target device instance.
tran_tgt_init() must return:
DDI_SUCCESS the HBA driver can support the addressed target, and was able to initialize per-target resources.
DDI_FAILURE the HBA driver cannot support the addressed target, or was unable to initialize per-target resources.
In this event, the initialization of this instance of the target device will not be continued, the target driver's
probe(9E) will not be called, and the tgt_dip structure destroyed.
