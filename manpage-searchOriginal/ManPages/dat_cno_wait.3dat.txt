 dat_cno_wait (
 IN DAT_CNO_HANDLE cno_handle,
 IN DAT_TIMEOUT timeout,
 OUT DAT_EVD_HANDLE *evd_handle
 )
cno_handle Handle for an instance of CNO
timeout The duration to wait for a notification. The value DAT_TIMEOUT_INFINITE can be used to wait indefi<hy>
nitely.
evd_handle Handle for an instance of EVD
The dat_cno_wait() function allows the Consumer to wait for notification events from a set of Event Dispatchers all
from the same Interface Adapter. The Consumer blocks until notified or the timeout period expires.
An Event Dispatcher that is disabled or in the "Waited" state does not deliver notifications. A uDAPL Consumer
waiting directly upon an Event Dispatcher preempts the CNO.
The consumer can optionally specify a timeout, after which it is unblocked even if there are no notification events.
On a timeout, evd_handle is explicitly set to a null handle.
The returned evd_handle is only a hint. Another Consumer can reap the Event before this Consumer can get around
to checking the Event Dispatcher. Additionally, other Event Dispatchers feeding this CNO might have been notified.
The Consumer is responsible for ensuring that all EVDs feeding this CNO are polled regardless of whether they are
identified as the immediate cause of the CNO unblocking.
All the waiters on the CNO, including the OS Wait Proxy Agent if it is associated with the CNO, are unblocked with
the NULL handle returns for an unblocking EVD evd_handle when the IA instance is destroyed or when all EVDs
the CNO is associated with are freed.
DAT_SUCCESS The operation was successful.
DAT_INVALID_HANDLE The cno_handle parameter is invalid.
DAT_QUEUE_EMPTY The operation timed out without a notification.
DAT_INVALID_PARAMETER One of the parameters was invalid or out of range, a combination of parameters
was invalid, or the timeout parameter is invalid.
DAT_INTERRUPTED_CALL The operation was interrupted by a signal.
