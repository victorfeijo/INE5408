/usr/sbin/metareplace [-s setname] [-f] RAID component-old component-new
The metareplace command is used to enable or replace components (slices) within a submirror or a RAID5 metade<hy>
vice.
When you replace a component, the metareplace command automatically starts resyncing the new component with
the rest of the metadevice. When the resync completes, the replaced component becomes readable and writable. If
the failed component has been hot spare replaced, the hot spare is placed in the available state and made available
for other hot spare replacements.
Note that the new component must be large enough to replace the old component.
A component may be in one of several states. The Last Erred and the Maintenance states require action. Always
replace components in the Maintenance state first, followed by a resync and validation of data. After components
requiring maintenance are fixed, validated, and resynced, components in the Last Erred state should be replaced. To
avoid data loss, it is always best to back up all data before replacing Last Erred devices.
Root privileges are required for all of the following options except -h.
-e Transitions the state of component to the available state and resyncs the failed component. If the failed component
has been hot spare replaced, the hot spare is placed in the available state and made available for other hot spare re<hy>
placements. This command is useful when a component fails due to human error (for example, accidentally turning
off a disk), or because the component was physically replaced. In this case, the replacement component must be par<hy>
titioned to match the disk being replaced before running the metareplace command.
-f Forces the replacement of an errored component of a metadevice in which multiple components are in error. The
component determined by the metastat display to be in the ``Maintenance'' state must be replaced first. This option
may cause data to be fabricated since multiple components are in error.
-h Display help message.
-s setname Specifies the name of the diskset on which metareplace will work. Using the -s option will cause the
command to perform its administrative function within the specified diskset. Without this option, the command will
perform its function on local metadevices.
mirror The metadevice name of the mirror.
component The logical name for the physical slice (partition) on a disk drive, such as /dev/dsk/c0t0d0s2.
component-old The physical slice that is being replaced.
component-new The physical slice that is replacing component-old.
RAID The metadevice name of the RAID5 device.
Example 1 Recovering from Error Condition in RAID5 Metadevice
This example shows how to recover when a single component in a RAID5 metadevice is errored.
<beginning of page>
 # metareplace d10 c3t0d0s2 c5t0d0s2
In this example, a RAID5 metadevice d10 has an errored component, c3t0d0s2, replaced by a new component,
c5t0d0s2.
Example 2 Use of -e After Physical Disk Replacement
This example shows the use of the -e option after a physical disk in a submirror (a submirror of mirror mymirror1,
in this case) has been replaced.
 # metareplace -e mymirror1 c1t4d0s2
Note: The replacement disk must be partitioned to match the disk it is replacing before running the metareplace
command.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred.
