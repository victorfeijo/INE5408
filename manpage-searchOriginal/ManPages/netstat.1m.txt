The netstat command displays the contents of certain network-related data structures in various formats, depending
on the options you select.
The netstat command has the several forms shown in the SYNOPSIS section, above, listed as follows: <bu> The first
form of the command (with no required arguments) displays a list of active sockets for each protocol. <bu> The second,
third, and fourth forms (-g, -p, and -s options) display information from various network data structures. <bu> The fifth
form (-m option) displays STREAMS memory statistics. <bu> The sixth form (-i option) shows the state of the inter<hy>
faces. <bu> The seventh form (-r option) displays the routing table. <bu> The eighth form (-M option) displays the multi<hy>
cast routing table. <bu> The ninth form (-D option) displays the state of DHCP on one or all interfaces.
These forms are described in greater detail below.
With no arguments (the first form), netstat displays connected sockets for PF_INET, PF_INET6, and PF_UNIX,
unless modified otherwise by the -f option.
-a
Show the state of all sockets, all routing table entries, or all interfaces, both physical and logical. Normally, listener
sockets used by server processes are not shown. Under most conditions, only interface, host, network, and default
routes are shown and only the status of physical interfaces is shown.
-f address_family
Limit all displays to those of the specified address_family. The value of address_family can be one of the following:
inet For the AF_INET address family showing IPv4 information.
inet6 For the AF_INET6 address family showing IPv6 information.
unix For the AF_UNIX address family.
-f filter
With -r only, limit the display of routes to those matching the specified filter. A filter rule consists of a keyword:val<hy>
ue pair. The known keywords and the value syntax are:
af:{inet|inet6|unix|number}
Selects an address family. This is identical to -f address_family and both syntaxes are supported.
<beginning of page>
outif:{name|ifIndex|any|none}
Selects an output interface. You can specify the interface by name (such as hme0) or by ifIndex number (for exam<hy>
ple, 2). If any is used, the filter matches all routes having a specified interface (anything other than null). If none is
used, the filter matches all routes having a null interface. Note that you can view the index number (ifIndex) for an
interface with the -a option of ifconfig(1M).
dst:{ip-address[/mask]|any|none}
Selects a destination IP address. If specified with a mask length, then any routes with matching or longer (more spe<hy>
cific) masks are selected. If any is used, then all but addresses but 0 are selected. If none is used, then address 0 is
selected.
flags:[+ -]?[ABDGHLMSU]+
Selects routes tagged with the specified flags. By default, the flags as specified must be set in order to match. With a
leading +, the flags specified must be set but others are ignored. With a leading -, the flags specified must not be set
and others are permitted.
You can specify multiple instances of -f to specify multiple filters. For example:
 % netstat -nr -f outif:hme0 -f outif:hme1 -f dst:10.0.0.0/8
The preceding command displays routes within network 10.0.0.0/8, with mask length 8 or greater, and an output in<hy>
terface of either hme0 or hme1, and excludes all other routes.
-g
Show the multicast group memberships for all interfaces. If the -v option is included, source-specific membership in<hy>
formation is also displayed. See DISPLAYS, below.
-i
Show the state of the interfaces that are used for IP traffic. Normally this shows statistics for the physical interfaces.
When combined with the -a option, this will also report information for the logical interfaces. See ifconfig(1M).
-m
Show the STREAMS memory statistics.
-n
Show network addresses as numbers. netstat normally displays addresses as symbols. This option may be used with
any of the display formats.
-p
Show the net to media tables. See DISPLAYS, below.
-r
Show the routing tables. Normally, only interface, host, network, and default routes are shown, but when this option
is combined with the -a option, all routes will be displayed, including cache. If you have not set up a multicast route,
-ra might not show any multicast routing entries, although the kernel will derive such an entry if needed.
-s
Show per-protocol statistics. When used with the -M option, show multicast routing statistics instead. When used
with the -a option, per-interface statistics will be displayed, when available, in addition to statistics global to the sys<hy>
tem. See DISPLAYS, below.
<beginning of page>
-T u | d
Display a time stamp.
Specify u for a printed representation of the internal representation of time. See time(2). Specify d for standard date
format. See date(1).
-v
Verbose. Show additional information for the sockets, STREAMS memory statistics, routing table, and multicast
group memberships.
-I interface
Show the state of a particular interface. interface can be any valid interface such as hme0 or eri0. Normally, the sta<hy>
tus and statistics for physical interfaces are displayed. When this option is combined with the -a option, information
for the logical interfaces is also reported.
-M
Show the multicast routing tables. When used with the -s option, show multicast routing statistics instead.
-P protocol
Limit display of statistics or state of all sockets to those applicable to protocol. The protocol can be one of ip, ipv6,
icmp, icmpv6, icmp, icmpv6, igmp, udp, tcp, rawip. rawip can also be specified as raw. The command accepts
protocol options only as all lowercase.
-D
Show the status of DHCP configured interfaces.
-R
This modifier displays extended security attributes for sockets and routing table entries. The -R modifier is available
only if the system is configured with the Solaris Trusted Extensions feature.
With -r only, this option displays the routing entries' gateway security attributes. See route(1M) for more informa<hy>
tion on security attributes.
When displaying socket information using the first form of the commmand, this option displays additional informa<hy>
tion for Multi-Level Port(MLP) sockets. This includes: <bu> The label for the peer if the socket is connected. <bu> The fol<hy>
lowing flags can be appended to the socket's "State" output:
P The socket is a MLP on zone-private IP addresses.
S The socket is a MLP on IP addresses shared between zones.
interval Display statistics accumulated since last display every interval seconds, repeating forever, unless count is
specified. When invoked with interval, the first row of netstat output shows statistics accumulated since last reboot.
The following options support interval: -i, -m, -s and -Ms. Some values are configuration parameters and are just re<hy>
displayed at each interval.
<beginning of page>
count Display interface statistics the number of times specified by count, at the interval specified by interval.
The display for each active socket shows the local and remote address, the send and receive queue sizes (in bytes),
the send and receive windows (in bytes), and the internal state of the protocol.
The symbolic format normally used to display socket addresses is either:
 hostname.port
when the name of the host is specified, or
 network.port
if a socket address specifies a network but no specific host.
The numeric host address or network number associated with the socket is used to look up the corresponding sym<hy>
bolic hostname or network name in the hosts or networks database.
If the network or hostname for an address is not known, or if the -n option is specified, the numerical network ad<hy>
dress is shown. Unspecified, or "wildcard", addresses and ports appear as an asterisk (*). For more information re<hy>
garding the Internet naming conventions, refer to inet(7P) and inet6(7P).
For SCTP sockets, because an endpoint can be represented by multiple addresses, the verbose option (-v) displays
the list of all the local and remote addresses.
The possible state values for TCP sockets are as follows:
BOUND Bound, ready to connect or listen.
CLOSED Closed. The socket is not being used.
CLOSING Closed, then remote shutdown; awaiting acknowledgment.
CLOSE_WAIT Remote shutdown; waiting for the socket to close.
ESTABLISHED Connection has been established.
FIN_WAIT_1 Socket closed; shutting down connection.
FIN_WAIT_2 Socket closed; waiting for shutdown from remote.
IDLE Idle, opened but not bound.
LAST_ACK Remote shutdown, then closed; awaiting acknowledgment.
LISTEN Listening for incoming connections.
SYN_RECEIVED Initial synchronization of the connection under way.
<beginning of page>
SYN_SENT Actively trying to establish connection.
TIME_WAIT Wait after close for remote shutdown retransmission.
The possible state values for SCTP sockets are as follows:
CLOSED Closed. The socket is not being used.
LISTEN Listening for incoming associations.
ESTABLISHED Association has been established.
COOKIE_WAIT INIT has been sent to the peer, awaiting acknowledgment.
COOKIE_ECHOED State cookie from the INIT-ACK has been sent to the peer, awaiting acknowledgement.
SHUTDOWN_PENDING SHUTDOWN has been received from the upper layer, awaiting acknowledgement of all
outstanding DATA from the peer.
SHUTDOWN_SENT All outstanding data has been acknowledged in the SHUTDOWN_SENT state. SHUT<hy>
DOWN has been sent to the peer, awaiting acknowledgement.
SHUTDOWN_RECEIVED SHUTDOWN has been received from the peer, awaiting acknowledgement of all out<hy>
standing DATA.
SHUTDOWN_ACK_SENT All outstanding data has been acknowledged in the SHUTDOWN_RECEIVED state.
SHUTDOWN_ACK has been sent to the peer.
The form of the display depends upon which of the -g, -m, -p, or -s options you select.
-g Displays the list of multicast group membership.
-m Displays the memory usage, for example, STREAMS mblks.
-p Displays the net to media mapping table. For IPv4, the address resolution table is displayed. See arp(1M). For
IPv6, the neighbor cache is displayed.
-s Displays the statistics for the various protocol layers.
The statistics use the MIB specified variables. The defined values for ipForwarding are:
forwarding(1) Acting as a gateway.
not-forwarding(2) Not acting as a gateway.
The IPv6 and ICMPv6 protocol layers maintain per-interface statistics. If the -a option is specified with the -s op<hy>
tion, then the per-interface statistics as well as the total sums are displayed. Otherwise, just the sum of the statistics
are shown.
<beginning of page>
For the second, third, and fourth forms of the command, you must specify at least -g, -p, or -s. You can specify any
combination of these options. You can also specify -m (the fifth form) with any set of the -g, -p, and -s options. If
you specify more than one of these options, netstat displays the information for each one of them.
The interface status display lists information for all current interfaces, one interface per line. If an interface is speci<hy>
fied using the -I option, it displays information for only the specified interface.
The list consists of the interface name, mtu (maximum transmission unit, or maximum packet size)(see ifcon<hy>
fig(1M)), the network to which the interface is attached, addresses for each interface, and counter associated with the
interface. The counters show the number of input packets, input errors, output packets, output errors, and collisions,
respectively. For Point-to-Point interfaces, the Net/Dest field is the name or address on the other side of the link.
If the -a option is specified with either the -i option or the -I option, then the output includes names of the physical
interface(s), counts for input packets and output packets for each logical interface, plus additional information.
If the -n option is specified, the list displays the IP address instead of the interface name.
If an optional interval is specified, the output will be continually displayed in interval seconds until interrupted by
the user or until count is reached. See OPERANDS.
The physical interface is specified using the -I option. When used with the interval operand, output for the -I option
has the following format:
 input eri0 output input (Total) output
 packets errs packets errs colls packets errs packets errs colls
 227681 0 659471 1 502 261331 0 99597 1 502
 10 0 0 0 0 10 0 0 0 0
 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0
 10 0 2 0 0 10 0 2 0 0
If the input interface is not specified, the first interface of address family inet or inet6 will be displayed.
The routing table display lists the available routes and the status of each. Each route consists of a destination host or
network, and a gateway to use in forwarding packets. The flags column shows the status of the route. These flags are
as follows:
U Indicates route is up.
G Route is to a gateway.
H Route is to a host and not a network.
M Redundant route established with the -multirt option.
S Route was established using the -setsrc option.
D Route was created dynamically by a redirect.
If the -a option is specified, there will be routing entries with the following flags:
A Combined routing and address resolution entries.
B Broadcast addresses.
L Local addresses for the host.
<beginning of page>
Interface routes are created for each interface attached to the local host; the gateway field for such entries shows the
address of the outgoing interface.
The use column displays the number of packets sent using a combined routing and address resolution (A) or a
broadcast (B) route. For a local (L) route, this count is the number of packets received, and for all other routes it is
the number of times the routing entry has been used to create a new combined route and address resolution entry.
The interface entry indicates the network interface utilized for the route.
The multicast routing table consists of the virtual interface table and the actual routing table.
The DHCP interface information consists of the interface name, its current state, lease information, packet counts,
and a list of flags.
The states correlate with the specifications set forth in RFC 2131.
Lease information includes: <bu> when the lease began; <bu> when lease renewal will begin; and <bu> when the lease will ex<hy>
pire.
The flags currently defined include:
BOOTP The interface has a lease obtained through BOOTP (IPv4 only).
BUSY The interface is busy with a DHCP transaction.
PRIMARY The interface is the primary interface. See dhcpinfo(1) and ifconfig(1M).
FAILED The interface is in failure state and must be manually restarted.
Packet counts are maintained for the number of packets sent, the number of packets received, and the number of
lease offers declined by the DHCP client. All three counters are initialized to zero and then incremented while ob<hy>
taining a lease. The counters are reset when the period of lease renewal begins for the interface. Thus, the counters
represent either the number of packets sent, received, and declined while obtaining the current lease, or the number
of packets sent, received, and declined while attempting to obtain a future lease.

When displaying interface information, netstat honors the DEFAULT_IP setting in /etc/default/inet_type. If it is
set to IP_VERSION4, then netstat will omit information relating to IPv6 interfaces, statistics, connections, routes
and the like.
However, you can override the DEFAULT_IP setting in /etc/default/inet_type on the command-line. For example,
if you have used the command-line to explicitly request IPv6 information by using the inet6 address family or one of
the IPv6 protocols, it will override the DEFAULT_IP setting.
<beginning of page>
If you need to examine network status information following a kernel crash, use the mdb(1) utility on the
savecore(1M) output.
The netstat utility obtains TCP statistics from the system by opening /dev/tcp and issuing queries. Because of this,
netstat might display an extra, unused connection in IDLE state when reporting connection status.
Previous versions of netstat had undocumented methods for reporting kernel statistics published using the kstat(7D)
facility. This functionality has been removed. Use kstat(1M) instead.
netstat restricts its output to information that is relevant to the zone in which netstat runs. (This is true for both
shared-IP and exclusive-IP zones.)
