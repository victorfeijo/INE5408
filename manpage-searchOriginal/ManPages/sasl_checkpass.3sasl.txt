int sasl_checkpass(sasl_conn_t *conn, const char *user, unsigned userlen,
 const char *pass, unsigned passlen);
The sasl_checkpass() interface checks a plaintext password. The sasl_checkpass() interface is used for protocols
that had a login method before SASL, for example, the LOGIN command in IMAP. The password is checked with
the pwcheck_method.
The sasl_checkpass() interface is a server interface. You cannot use it to check passwords from a client.
The sasl_checkpass() interface checks the posible repositories until it succeeds or there are no more repositories. If
sasl_server_userdb_checkpass_t is registered, sasl_checkpass() tries it first.
Use the pwcheck_method SASL option to specify which pwcheck methods to use.
The sasl_checkpass() interface supports the transition of passwords if the SASL option auto_transition is on.
If user is NULL, check is plaintext passwords are enabled.
conn The sasl_conn_t for which the request is being made
pass Plaintext password to check
passlen The length of pass
user User to query in current user_domain
userlen The length of username.
sasl_checkpass() returns an integer that corresponds to a SASL error code.
SASL_OK Indicates that the authentication is complete
All other error codes indicate an error situation that must be handled, or the authentication session should be quit.
See sasl_errors(3SASL) for information on SASL error codes.
