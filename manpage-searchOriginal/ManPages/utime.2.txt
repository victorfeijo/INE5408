utime <-> set file access and modification times
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <utime.h>
int utime(const char *path, const struct utimbuf *times);
The utime() function sets the access and modification times of the file pointed to by path, and causes the time of the
last file status change (st_ctime) to be updated.
If times is NULL, the access and modification times of the file are set to the current time. A process must be the own<hy>
er of the file or have write permission to use utime() in this manner.
If times is not NULL, times is interpreted as a pointer to a utimbuf structure (defined in <utime.h>) and the access
and modification times are set to the values contained in the designated structure. Only the owner of the file or a
process that has the {PRIV_FILE_OWNER} privilege asserted in its effective set can use utime() in this manner.
The utimbuf structure contains the following members:
 time_t actime; /* access time */
 time_t modtime; /* modification time */
The times contained in the members of the utimbuf structure are measured in seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January
1, 1970.
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. Otherwise, <mi>1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
The utime() function will fail if:
EACCES Search permission is denied by a component of the path prefix.
EACCES The process does not have appropriate privileges and is not the owner of the file, write permission is de<hy>
nied for the file, and times is NULL.
EFAULT The path argument points to an illegal address.
EINTR A signal was caught during the execution of the utime() function.
EIO An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
ELOOP Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating path.
ENAMETOOLONG The length of the path argument exceeds PATH_MAX, or the length of a path component ex<hy>
ceeds NAME_MAX while _POSIX_NO_TRUNC is in effect.
ENOENT The named file does not exist or is a null pathname.
ENOLINK The path argument points to a remote machine and the link to that machine is no longer active.
ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
EPERM The effective user of the calling process is not the owner of the file, {PRIV_FILE_OWNER} is not as<hy>
serted in the effective set of the calling process, and times is not NULL.

EROFS The file system containing the file is mounted read-only.
