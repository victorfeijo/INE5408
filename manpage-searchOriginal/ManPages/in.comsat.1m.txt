/usr/sbin/in.comsat
comsat is the server process which listens for reports of incoming mail and notifies users who have requested to be
told when mail arrives. It is invoked as needed by inetd(1M), and times out if inactive for a few minutes.
comsat listens on a datagram port associated with the biff service specification (see services(4)) for one line mes<hy>
sages of the form
user@mailbox-offset
If the user specified is logged in to the system and the associated terminal has the owner execute bit turned on (by a
biff y), the offset is used as a seek offset into the appropriate mailbox file, and the first 7 lines or 560 characters of
the message are printed on the user's terminal. Lines which appear to be part of the message header other than the
From, To, Date, or Subject lines are not printed when displaying the message.
