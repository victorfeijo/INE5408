nisln <-> symbolically link NIS+ objects
nisln [-L] [-D defaults] name linkname
The nisln command links a NIS+ object named name to a NIS+ name linkname. If name is an indexed name (see
nismatch(1)), the link points to entries within a NIS+ table. Clients wishing to look up information in the name ser<hy>
vice can use the FOLLOW_LINKS flag to force the client library to follow links to the name they point to. Further,
all of the NIS+ administration commands accept the -L switch indicating they should follow links (see
nis_names(3NSL) for a description of the FOLLOW_LINKS flag).
When creating the link, nisln verifies that the linked object exists. Once created, the linked object may be deleted or
replaced and the link will not be affected. At that time, the link will become invalid and attempts to follow it will re<hy>
turn NIS_LINKNAMEERROR to the client. When the path attribute in tables specifies a link rather than another
table, the link will be followed if the flag FOLLOW_LINKS was present in the call to nis_list() (see nis_ta<hy>
bles(3NSL)) and ignored if the flag is not present. If the flag is present and the link is no longer valid, a warning is
sent to the system logger and the link is ignored.
The following options are supported:
-D defaults Specify a different set of defaults to be used for the creation of the link object. The defaults string is a se<hy>
ries of tokens separated by colons. These tokens represent the default values to be used for the generic object proper<hy>
ties. All of the legal tokens are described below.
ttl=time This token sets the default time to live for objects that are created by this command. The value time is speci<hy>
fied in the format as defined by the nischttl(1) command. The default is 12 hours.
owner=ownername This token specifies that the NIS+ principal ownername should own the created object. The de<hy>
fault for this value is the the principal who is executing the command.
group=groupname This token specifies that the group groupname should be the group owner for the object that is
created. The default is NULL.
access=rights This token specifies the set of access rights that are to be granted for the given object. The value rights
is specified in the format as defined by the nischmod(1) command. The default value is <mi><mi><mi><mi>rmcdr<mi><mi><mi>r<mi><mi><mi>.
-L When present, this option specifies that this command should follow links. If name is itself a link, then this com<hy>
mand will follow it to the linked object that it points to. The new link will point to that linked object rather than to
name.
Example 1 Creating a link
In this example, we create a link in the domain foo.com. named hosts that points to the object hosts.bar.com.:
 example% nisln hosts.bar.com. hosts.foo.com.
Example 2 Making a link that points to an entry in the hosts table
In this example, we make a link example.foo.com. that points to an entry in the hosts table in eng.foo.com:
 example% nisln '[name=example],hosts.eng.foo.com.' example.foo.com.
NIS_PATH If this variable is set, and the NIS+ name is not fully qualified, each directory specified will be searched
until the object is found (see nisdefaults(1)).
The following exit values are returned:

0 Successful operation.
1 Operation failed.

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
NIS+ to LDAP are available in the current Solaris release. For more information, visit http://www.sun.com/directo<hy>
