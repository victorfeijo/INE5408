rum <-> Ralink RT2501/RT2601/RT73USB 802.11b/g Wireless Driver
The rum 802.11b/g wireless NIC driver is a multi-threaded, loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based STREAMS driver
supporting the Ralink RT2501/RT2601/RT73USB chipset-based NIC's.
The rum driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rate and mode. Supported 802.11b data rates are 1,
2, 5.5 and 11 Mbits/sec. Supported 802.11g data rates are 1, 2, 5.5, 11, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 54 Mbits/sec.
The rum driver supports only BSS networks (also known as "ap" or "infrastructure" networks) and "open" (or
"open-system") or "shared system" authentication.
