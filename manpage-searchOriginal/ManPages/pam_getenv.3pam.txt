char *pam_getenv(pam_handle_t *pamh, const char *name);
The pam_getenv() function searches the PAM handle pamh for a value associated with name. If a value is present,
pam_getenv() makes a copy of the value and returns a pointer to the copy back to the calling application. If no such
entry exists, pam_getenv() returns NULL. It is the responsibility of the calling application to free the memory re<hy>
turned by pam_getenv().
If successful, pam_getenv() returns a copy of the value associated with name in the PAM handle; otherwise, it re<hy>
turns a NULL pointer.
