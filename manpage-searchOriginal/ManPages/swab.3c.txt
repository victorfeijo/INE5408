swab <-> swap bytes
#include <stdlib.h>
void swab(const char *src, char *dest, ssize_t nbytes);
#include <unistd.h>
void swab(const void *restrict src, void *restrict dest, ssize_t nbytes);
The swab() function copies nbytes bytes, which are pointed to by src, to the object pointed to by dest, exchanging
adjacent bytes. The nbytes argument should be even. If nbytes is odd swab() copies and exchanges nbytes<mi>1 bytes
and the disposition of the last byte is unspecified. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is
undefined. If nbytes is negative, swab() does nothing.
No errors are defined.
