pkgproto <-> generate prototype file entries for input to pkgmk command
pkgproto [-i] [-c class] [path1]
pkgproto [-i] [-c class] [path1=path2]...
pkgproto scans the indicated paths and generates prototype(4) file entries that may be used as input to the
pkgmk(1) command.
If no paths are specified on the command line, standard input is assumed to be a list of paths. If the pathname listed
on the command line is a directory, the contents of the directory is searched. However, if input is read from stdin, a
directory specified as a pathname will not be searched.
Package commands, such as pkgproto, are largefile(5)-aware. They handle files larger than 2 GB in the same way
they handle smaller files. In their current implementations, pkgadd(1M), pkgtrans(1) and other package commands
can process a datastream of up to 4 GB.
-i Ignores symbolic links and records the paths as ftype=f (a file) versus ftype=s (symbolic link).
-c class Maps the class of all paths to class.
path1 Pathname where objects are located.
path2 Pathname which should be substituted on output for path1.
Example 1 Basic Usage
The following example shows a common usage of pkgproto and a partial listing of the output produced.
 example% pkgproto /bin=bin /usr/bin=usrbin /etc=etc
 f none bin/sed=/bin/sed 0775 bin bin
 f none bin/sh=/bin/sh 0755 bin daemon
 f none bin/sort=/bin/sort 0755 bin bin
 f none usrbin/sdb=/usr/bin/sdb 0775 bin bin
 f none usrbin/shl=/usr/bin/shl 4755 bin bin
 d none etc/master.d 0755 root daemon
 f none etc/master.d/kernel=/etc/master.d/kernel 0644 root daemon
 f none etc/rc=/etc/rc 0744 root daemon
Example 2 Using pkgproto in a Pipeline
The following command shows pkgproto accepting the output of the find command.
 example% find / -type d -print | pkgproto
 d none / 755 root root
 d none /bin 755 bin bin
 d none /usr 755 root root
 d none /usr/bin 775 bin bin
 d none /etc 755 root root
 d none /tmp 777 root root

Application Packaging Developer's Guide
By default, pkgproto creates symbolic link entries for any symbolic link encountered (ftype=s). When you use the
-i option, pkgproto creates a file entry for symbolic links (ftype=f). The prototype(4) file would have to be edited
to assign such file types as v (volatile), e (editable), or x (exclusive directory). pkgproto detects linked files. If mul<hy>
tiple files are linked together, the first path encountered is considered the source of the link.
By default, pkgproto prints prototype entries on the standard output. However, the output should be saved in a file
(named Prototype or prototype, for convenience) to be used as input to the pkgmk(1) command.
