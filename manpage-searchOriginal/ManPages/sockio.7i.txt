sockio <-> ioctls that operate directly on sockets
#include <sys/sockio.h>
The ioctls listed in this manual page apply directly to sockets, independent of any underlying protocol. The setsock<hy>
opt() call (see getsockopt(3SOCKET)) is the primary method for operating on sockets, rather than on the underly<hy>
ing protocol or network interface. ioctls for a specific network interface or protocol are documented in the manual
page for that interface or protocol.
SIOCSPGRP The argument is a pointer to an int. Set the process-group ID that will subsequently receive SIGIO or
SIGURG signals for the socket referred to by the descriptor passed to ioctl to the value of that int. The argument
must be either positive (in which case it must be a process ID) or negative (in which case it must be a process
group).
SIOCGPGRP The argument is a pointer to an int. Set the value of that int to the process-group ID that is receiving
SIGIO or SIGURG signals for the socket referred to by the descriptor passed to ioctl.
SIOCCATMARK The argument is a pointer to an int. Set the value of that int to 1 if the read pointer for the socket
referred to by the descriptor passed to ioctl points to a mark in the data stream for an out-of-band message. Set the
value of that int to 0 if the read pointer for the socket referred to by the descriptor passed to ioctl does not point to a
mark in the data stream for an out-of-band message.
