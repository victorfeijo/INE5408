#include <sys/pccard.h>
int32_t csx_Parse_CISTPL_SPCL(client_handle_t ch, tuple_t *tu,
 cistpl_spcl_t *csp);
Solaris DDI Specific (Solaris DDI)
ch Client handle returned from csx_RegisterClient(9F).
tu Pointer to a tuple_t structure (see tuple(9S)) returned by a call to csx_GetFirstTuple(9F) or csx_GetNext<hy>
Tuple(9F).
csp Pointer to a cistpl_spcl_t structure which contains the parsed CISTPL_SPCL tuple information upon return
from this function.
This function parses the Special Purpose tuple, CISTPL_SPCL, into a form usable by PC Card drivers.
The CISTPL_SPCL tuple is identified by an identification field that is assigned by PCMCIA or JEIDA. A se<hy>
quence field allows a series of CISTPL_SPCL tuples to be used when the data exceeds the size that can be stored in
a single tuple; the maximum data area of a series of CISTPL_SPCL tuples is unlimited. Another field gives the
number of bytes in the data field in this tuple.
The structure members of cistpl_date_t are:
 uint32_t id; /* tuple contents identification */
 uint32_t seq; /* data sequence number */
 uint32_t bytes; /* number of bytes following */
 uchar_t data[CIS_MAX_TUPLE_DATA_LEN];
The fields are defined as follows:
id This field contains a PCMCIA or JEIDA assigned value that identifies this series of one or more CISTPL_SP<hy>
CL tuples. These field values are assigned by contacting either PCMCIA or JEIDA.
seq This field contains a data sequence number. CISTPL_SPCL_SEQ_END is the last tuple in sequence.
bytes This field contains the number of data bytes in the data[CIS_MAX_TUPLE_DATA_LEN].
data The data component of this tuple.
CS_SUCCESS Successful operation.
CS_BAD_HANDLE Client handle is invalid.
CS_UNKNOWN_TUPLE Parser does not know how to parse tuple.
CS_NO_CARD No PC Card in socket.
CS_NO_CIS No Card Information Structure (CIS) on PC Card.

CS_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION No PCMCIA hardware installed.
