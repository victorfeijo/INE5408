getdev <-> lists devices based on criteria
getdev [-ae] [criteria]... [device]...
getdev generates a list of devices that match certain criteria. The criteria includes a list of attributes (given in expres<hy>
sions) and a list of devices. If no criteria are given, all devices are included in the list.
Devices must satisfy at least one of the criteria in the list unless the -a option is used. Then, only those devices
which match all of the criteria in a list will be included.
Devices which are defined on the command line and which match the criteria are included in the generated list.
However, if the -e option is used, the list becomes a set of devices to be excluded from the list. See OPTIONS and
OPERANDS.
The following options are supported:
-a Specifies that a device must match all criteria to be included in the list generated by this command. The option
has no effect if no criteria are defined.
-e Specifies that the list of devices which follows on the command line should be excluded from the list generated by
this command. Without the -e the named devices are included in the generated list. The flag has no effect if no de<hy>
vices are defined.
The following operands are supported:
criteria Defines the criteria that a device must match to be included in the generated list. criteria is specified by ex<hy>
pressions.
There are four possible expression types which the criteria specified in the criteria argument may follow:
attribute=value Selects all devices whose attribute attribute is defined and is equal to value.
attribute!=value Selects all devices whose attribute attribute is defined and does not equal value.
attribute:* Selects all devices which have the attribute attribute defined.
attribute!:* Selects all devices which do not have the attribute attribute defined.
See the putdev(1M) manual page for a complete listing and description of available attributes.
device Defines the devices which should be included in the generated list. This can be the pathname of the device or
the device alias.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
1 Command syntax was incorrect, invalid option was used, or an internal error occurred.
2 Device table could not be opened for reading.
