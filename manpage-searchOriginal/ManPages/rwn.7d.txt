rwn <-> Ralink RT2700/2800 IEEE802.11 a/b/g/n wireless network device
The rwn IEEE802.11 a/b/g/n wireless driver is a multi-threaded, loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based STREAMS driv<hy>
er supporting Ralink RT2700/RT2800 IEEE802.11 a/b/g/n wireless network device.
The rwn driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rate and mode. The driver supports only BSS net<hy>
works (also known as ap or infrastructure networks) and open (open-system) or shared system authentication.
For wireless security, WEP encryption, WPA-PSK, and WPA2-PSK are currently supported. You can perform con<hy>
figuration and administration tasks using the dladm(1M) and wificonfig(1M) utilities.
