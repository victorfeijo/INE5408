pset_info <-> get information about a processor set
#include <sys/pset.h>
int pset_info(psetid_t pset, int *type, uint_t *numcpus,
 processorid_t *cpulist);
The pset_info() function returns information on the processor set pset.
If type is non-null, then on successful completion the type of the processor set will be stored in the location pointed
to by type. The only type supported for active processor sets is PS_PRIVATE.
If numcpus is non-null, then on successful completion the number of processors in the processor set will be stored in
the location pointed to by numcpus.
If numcpus and cpulist are both non-null, then cpulist points to a buffer where a list of processors assigned to the
processor set is to be stored, and numcpus points to the maximum number of processor IDs the buffer can hold. On
successful completion, the list of processors up to the maximum buffer size is stored in the buffer pointed to by
cpulist.
If pset is PS_NONE, the list of processors not assigned to any processor set will be stored in the buffer pointed to by
cpulist, and the number of such processors will be stored in the location pointed to by numcpus. The location point<hy>
ed to by type will be set to PS_NONE.
If pset is PS_MYID, the processor list and number of processors returned will be those of the processor set to which
the caller is bound. If the caller is not bound to a processor set, the result will be equivalent to setting pset to
PS_NONE.
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. Otherwise, <mi>1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
The pset_info() function will fail if:
EFAULT The location pointed to by type, numcpus, or cpulist was not null and not writable by the user.
EINVAL An invalid processor set ID was specified.
The caller is in a non-global zone, the pools facility is active, and the processor is not a member of the zone's pool's
processor set.
