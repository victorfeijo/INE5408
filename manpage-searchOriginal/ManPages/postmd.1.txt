/usr/lib/lp/postscript/postmd
The postmd filter reads a series of floating point numbers from files, translates them into a PostScript gray scale im<hy>
age, and writes the results on the standard output. In a typical application, the numbers might be the elements of a
large matrix, written in row major order, while the printed image could help locate patterns in the matrix. If no files
are specified, or if - is one of the input files, the standard input is read.
The following options are supported:
-b num Packs the bitmap in the output file using num byte patterns. A value of 0 turns off all packing of the output
file. By default, num is 6.
-c num Prints num copies of each page. By default, only one copy is printed.
-d dimen Sets the default matrix dimensions for all input files to dimen. The dimen string can be given as rows or
rowsx columns. If columns is omitted it will be set to rows. By default, postmd assumes each matrix is square and
sets the number of rows and columns to the square root of the number of elements in each input file.
-g list list is a comma- or space-separated string of integers, each lying between 0 and 255 inclusive, that assigns
PostScript gray scales to the regions of the real line selected by the -i option. 255 corresponds to white, and 0, to
black. The postmd filter assigns a default gray scale that omits white (that is, 255) and gets darker as the regions
move from left to right along the real line.
-i list list is a comma-, space-, or slash(/)-separated string of N floating point numbers that partition the real line into
2N+1 regions. The list must be given in increasing numerical order. The partitions are used to map floating point
numbers read from the input files into gray scale integers that are either assigned automatically by postmd or arbi<hy>
trarily selected using the -g option. The default interval list is -1,0,1, which partions the real line into seven regions.
-m num Magnifies each logical page by the factor num. Pages are scaled uniformly about the origin which, by de<hy>
fault, is located at the center of each page. The default magnification is 1.0.
-n num Prints num logical pages on each piece of paper, where num can be any positive integer. By default, num is
set to 1.
-o list Prints pages whose numbers are given in the comma separated list. The list contains single numbers N and
ranges N1 - N2. A missing N1 means the lowest numbered page, a missing N2 means the highest. The page range is
an expression of logical pages rather than physical sheets of paper. For example, if you are printing two logical
pages to a sheet, and you specified a range of 4, then two sheets of paper would print, containing four page layouts.
If you specified a page range of 3-4, when requesting two logical pages to a sheet; then only page 3 and page 4 lay<hy>
outs would print, and they would appear on one physical sheet of paper.
-p mode Prints files in either portrait or landscape mode. Only the first character of mode is significant. The default
mode is portrait.
-w window window is a comma- or space-separated list of four positive integers that select the upper left and lower
right corners of a submatrix from each of the input files. Row and column indices start at 1 in the upper left corner
and the numbers in the input files are assumed to be written in row major order. By default, the entire matrix is dis<hy>
played.
<beginning of page>
-x num Translates the origin num inches along the positive x axis. The default coordinate system has the origin fixed
at the center of the page, with positive x to the right and positive y up the page. Positive num moves everything right.
The default offset is 0 inches.
-y num Translates the origin num inches along the positive y axis. Positive num moves everything up the page. The
default offset is 0.
Only one matrix is displayed on each logical page, and each of the input files must contain complete descriptions of
exactly one matrix. Matrix elements are floating point numbers arranged in row major order in each input file.
White space, including newlines, is not used to determine matrix dimensions. By default, postmd assumes each ma<hy>
trix is square and sets the number of rows and columns to the square root of the number of elements in the input file.
Supplying default dimensions on the command line with the -d option overrides this default behavior, and in that
case the dimensions apply to all input files.
An optional header can be supplied with each input file and is used to set the matrix dimensions, the partition of the
real line, the gray scale map, and a window into the matrix. The header consists of keyword/value pairs, each on a
separate line. It begins on the first line of each input file and ends with the first unrecognized string, which should be
the first matrix element. Values set in the header take precedence, but apply only to the current input file. Recog<hy>
nized header keywords are dimension, interval, grayscale, and window. The syntax of the value string that follows
each keyword parallels what is accepted by the -d, -i, -g, and -w options. Example 1 Generating an interval list
For example, suppose file initially contains the 1000 numbers in a 20x50 matrix. Then you can produce exactly the
same output by completing three steps.
1. First, issue the following command line:
 example% postmd -d20x50 -i"-100 100" -g0,128,254,128,0 file
2. Second, prepend the following header to file:
 example% postmd -d20x50 -i"<mi>100 100" -g0,128,254,128,0 file
3. Third, issue the following command line:
 example% postmd file
The interval list partitions the real line into five regions and the gray scale list maps numbers less than -100 or
greater than 100 into 0 (that is, black), numbers equal to -100 or 100 into 128 (that is, 50 percent black), and num<hy>
bers between -100 and 100 into 254 (that is, almost white).

The largest matrix that can be adequately displayed is a function of the interval and gray scale lists, the printer reso<hy>
lution, and the paper size. A 600 by 600 matrix is an optimistic upper bound for a two element interval list (that is,
five regions) using 8.5 by 11 inch paper on a 300 dpi printer.
Using white (that is, 255) in a gray scale list is not recommended and won't show up in the legend and bar graph
that postmd displays below each image.
