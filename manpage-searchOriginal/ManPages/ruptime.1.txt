ruptime <-> show host status of local machines
ruptime [-ar] [-l | -t | -u]
The ruptime utility gives a status line like uptime (see uptime(1)) for each machine on the local network; these are
formed from packets broadcast by each host on the network approximately every three minutes.
Machines for which no status report has been received for 11 minutes are shown as being down.
Normally, the listing is sorted by host name, but this order can be changed by specifying one of the options listed be<hy>
low.
The following options are supported:
-a Counts even those users who have been idle for an hour or more.
-r Reverses the sorting order.
-l | -t | -u These options are mutually exclusive. The use of one overrides the previous one(s).
-l Sorts the display by load average.
-t Sorts the display by up time.
-u Sorts the display by number of users.
