yp_update <-> change NIS information
#include <rpcsvc/ypclnt.h>
int yp_update(char *domain, char *map, unsigned ypop, char *key,
 char *int keylen, char *data, int datalen);
yp_update() is used to make changes to the NIS database. The syntax is the same as that of yp_match() except for
the extra parameter ypop which may take on one of four values. If it is POP_CHANGE then the data associated
with the key will be changed to the new value. If the key is not found in the database, then yp_update() will return
YPERR_KEY. If ypop has the value YPOP_INSERT then the key-value pair will be inserted into the database.
The error YPERR_KEY is returned if the key already exists in the database. To store an item into the database with<hy>
out concern for whether it exists already or not, pass ypop as YPOP_STORE and no error will be returned if the key
already or does not exist. To delete an entry, the value of ypop should be YPOP_DELETE.
This routine depends upon secure RPC, and will not work unless the network is running secure RPC.
If the value of ypop is POP_CHANGE, yp_update() returns the error YPERR_KEY if the key is not found in the
database.
If the value of ypop is POP_INSERT, yp_update() returns the error YPERR_KEY if the key already exists in the
database.
