iscsi <-> iSCSI software initiator driver and service
The iscsi driver is a software initiator that transports SCSI commands over TCP/IP as described in RFC 3720.
The initiator driver is administered through iscsiadm(1M). The iscsi initiator service is managed by the service man<hy>
agement facility, smf(5), under the following FMRI:
 svc:/network/iscsi/initiator:default
The iscsi initiator acts as a host adapter driver that attaches the appropriate target driver, for example, sd(7D) for
disks, or st(7D) for tapes) for devices it discovers. See the System Administration Guide: Devices and File Systems
for more information.
Once enabled, the iscsi initiator service ensures the right timing to start the discovery and enumeration of iSCSI de<hy>
vices during boot, but it doesn't guarantee the success of discovery for certain iSCSI devices. If the service is dis<hy>
abled, iscsi driver stops the discovery and enumeration of iSCSI devices and also tries to offline all existing iSCSI
devices. iscsiadm(1M) works only when the service is enabled.
iSCSI boot(1M) is not affected by the status of the iscsi initiator service.
