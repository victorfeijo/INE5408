cal socket number.
Attributes Must be 0.
CS_SUCCESS Card Services has noted the reset request.
CS_IN_USE This Card Services implementation does not permit configured cards to be reset.
CS_BAD_HANDLE Client handle is invalid.
CS_NO_CARD No PC card in socket.
CS_BAD_SOCKET Specified socket or function number is invalid.
CS_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION No PCMCIA hardware installed.
This function may be called from user or kernel context.
