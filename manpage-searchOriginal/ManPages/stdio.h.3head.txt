stdio.h, stdio <-> standard buffered input/output
#include <stdio.h>
The <stdio.h> header defines the following macros as positive integer constant expressions:
BUFSIZ size of <stdio.h> buffers
_IOFBF input/output fully buffered
_IOLBF input/output line buffered
_IONBF input/output unbuffered
L_ctermid maximum size of character array to hold ctermid() output
L_tmpnam maximum size of character array to hold tmpnam() output
SEEK_CUR seek relative to current position
SEEK_END seek relative to end-of-file
SEEK_SET seek relative to start-of-file
The following macros are defined as positive integer constant expressions that denote implementation limits:
{FILENAME_MAX} Maximum size in bytes of the longest filename string that the implementation guarantees can
be opened.
{FOPEN_MAX} Number of streams that the implementation guarantees can be open simultaneously. The value is
at least eight.
{TMP_MAX} Minimum number of unique filenames generated by tmpnam(). Maximum number of times an ap<hy>
plication can call tmpnam() reliably. The value of {TMP_MAX} is at least 25. On XSI-conformant systems, the
value of {TMP_MAX} is at least 10000.
The following macro name is defined as a negative integer constant expression:
EOF end-of-file return value
The following macro name is defined as a null pointer constant:
NULL null pointer
The following macro name is defined as a string constant:
P_tmpdir default directory prefix for tempnam()
The following is defined as expressions of type "pointer to FILE" point to the FILE objects associated, respectively,
with the standard error, input, and output streams:
<beginning of page>
stderr standard error output stream
stdin standard input stream
stdout standard output stream
The following data types are defined through typedef:
FILE structure containing information about a file
fpos_t non-array type containing all information needed to specify uniquely every position within a file
va_list as described in <stdarg.h>
size_t as described in <stddef.h>
