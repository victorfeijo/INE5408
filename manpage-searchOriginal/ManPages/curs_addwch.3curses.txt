int addwch(chtype wch);
int waddwch(WINDOW *win, chtype wch);
int mvaddwch(int y, int x, chtype wch);
int mvwaddwch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, chtype wch);
int echowchar(chtype wch);
int wechowchar(WINDOW *win, chtype wch);
The addwch(),waddwch(),mvaddwch(), and mvwaddwch() routines put the character wch, holding a wchar_t
character, into the window at the current cursor position of the window and advance the position of the window cur<hy>
sor. Their function is similar to that of putwchar(3C) in the C multibyte library. At the right margin, an automatic
newline is performed. At the bottom of the scrolling region, if scrollok is enabled, the scrolling region is scrolled up
one line.
If wch is a tab, newline, or backspace, the cursor is moved appropriately within the window. A newline also does a
clrtoeol(3CURSES) before moving. Tabs are considered to be at every eighth column. If wch is another control
character, it is drawn in the ^X notation. Calling winwch(3CURSES) after adding a control character does not return
the control character, but instead returns the representation of the control character.
Video attributes can be combined with a wchar_t character by OR-ing them into the parameter. This results in these
attributes also being set. (The intent here is that text, including attributes, can be copied from one place to another
using inwch() and addwch().) See standout(3CURSES), predefined video attribute constants.
The echowchar() and wechowchar() routines are functionally equivalent to a call to addwch() followed by a call
to refresh(3CURSES), or a call to waddwch() followed by a call to wrefresh(3CURSES). The knowledge that on<hy>
ly a single character is being output is taken into consideration and, for non-control characters, a considerable per<hy>
formance gain might be seen by using these routines instead of their equivalents.
The following variables may be used to add line drawing characters to the screen with routines of the addwch()
family. When variables are defined for the terminal, the A_ALTCHARSET bit is turned on. (See curs_at<hy>
tr(3CURSES)). Otherwise, the default character listed below is stored in the variable. The names chosen are consis<hy>
tent with the VT100 nomenclature.

All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an integer value other than ERR upon successful completion,
unless otherwise noted in the preceding routine descriptions.

The header file <curses.h> automatically includes the header files <stdio.h>, <unctrl.h> and <widec.h>.
Note that addwch(), mvaddwch(), mvwaddwch(), and echowchar() may be macros.
None of these routines can use the color attribute in chtype.
