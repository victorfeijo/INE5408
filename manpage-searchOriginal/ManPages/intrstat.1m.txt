intrstat <-> report interrupt statistics
/usr/sbin/intrstat [-c cpulist | -C processor_set_id] [-T u | d ]
 [-x opt[=val]] [interval [count]]
The intrstat utility gathers and displays run-time interrupt statistics. The output is a table of device names and CPU
IDs, where each row of the table denotes a device, and each column of the table denotes a CPU. Each cell in the ta<hy>
ble contains both the raw number of interrupts for the given device on the given CPU, and the percentage of absolute
time spent in that device's interrupt handler on that CPU.
The device name is given in the form of {name}#{instance}. The name is the normalized driver name, and typically
corresponds to the name of the module implementing the driver. See ddi_driver_name(9F). Many Sun-delivered
drivers have their own manual pages. See Intro(7).
If standard output is a terminal, the table contains as many columns of data as can fit within the terminal width. If
standard output is not a terminal, the table contains at most four columns of data. By default, data is gathered and
displayed for all CPUs. If the data cannot fit in a single table, it is printed across multiple tables. The set of CPUs for
which data is displayed can be optionally specified with the -c or -C option.
By default, intrstat displays data once per second and runs indefinitely. Both of these behaviors can be optionally
controlled with the interval and count parameters, respectively. See OPERANDS.
Because intrstat uses dynamic discovery, it reports only on devices that raise interrupts while the command is run<hy>
ning. Any devices that are silent while intrstat is running are not displayed.
intrstat induces a small system-wide performance degradation. As a result, only the super-user can run intrstat by
default. The Solaris Dynamic Tracing Guide explains how administrators can grant privileges to other users to per<hy>
mit them to run intrstat.
The following options are supported:
-c cpulist
Displays data for the CPUs specified by cpulist.
cpulist can be a single processor ID (for example, 4), a range of processor IDs (for example, 4-6), or a comma sepa<hy>
rated list of processor IDs or processor ID ranges (for example, 4,5,6 or 4,6-8).
-C processor_set_id
Displays data for the CPUs in the processor set specified by processor_set_id.
intrstat modifies its output to always reflect the CPUs in the specified processor set. If a CPU is added to the set, in<hy>
trstat modifies its output to include the added CPU. If a CPU is removed from the set, intrstat modifies its output to
exclude the removed CPU. At most one processor set can be specified.
-T u | d
Display a time stamp.
Specify u for a printed representation of the internal representation of time. See time(2). Specify d for standard date
format. See date(1).
-x opt[=val]
Enable or modify a DTrace runtime option or D compiler option. The list of options is found in the Solaris Dynamic
Tracing Guide. A boolean option is enabled by specifying its name. Options with values are set by separating the op<hy>
tion name and value with an equal sign (=)
The following operands are supported:
count
Indicates the number of intervals to execute before exiting.
<beginning of page>
interval
Indicates the number of seconds to be executed before exiting.
Example 1 Using intrstat Without Options
Without options, intrstat displays a table of trap types and CPUs. At most, four columns can fit in the default termi<hy>
nal width. If there are more than four CPUs, multiple tables are displayed.
The following example runs intrstat on a uniprocessor Intel IA/32-based laptop:
 example# intrstat
