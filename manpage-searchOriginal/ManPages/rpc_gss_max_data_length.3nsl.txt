int rpc_gss_max_data_length(AUTH *handle, int max_tp_unit_len);
int rpc_gss_svc_max_data_length(struct svc_req *req, int max_tp_unit_len);
Performing a security transformation on a piece of data generally produces data with a different (usually greater)
length. For some transports, such as UDP, there is a maximum length of data which can be sent out in one data unit.
Applications need to know the maximum size a piece of data can be before it's transformed, so that the resulting da<hy>
ta will still "fit" on the transport. These two functions return that maximum size.
rpc_gss_max_data_length() is the client-side version; rpc_gss_svc_max_data_length() is the server-side version.
handle An RPC context handle of type AUTH, returned when a context is created (for example, by rpc_gss_seccre<hy>
ate(). Security service and QOP are bound to this handle, eliminating any need to specify them.
max_tp_unit_len The maximum size of a piece of data allowed by the transport.
req A pointer to an RPC svc_req structure, containing information on the context (for example, program number
and credentials).
Both functions return the maximum size of untransformed data allowed, as an int.
