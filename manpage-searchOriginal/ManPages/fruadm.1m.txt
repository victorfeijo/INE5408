fruadm <-> prints and updates customer data associated with FRUs
/usr/platform/sun4u/sbin/fruadm
/usr/platform/sun4u/sbin/fruadm -l
/usr/platform/sun4u/sbin/fruadm [-r] path [text]
fruadm prints or sets the customer data for Field-Replaceable Units (FRUs).
Without arguments, fruadm prints the paths of all FRU ID-capable FRUs (containers) in the system, along with the
contents of the customer data record, if present, for each such FRU; for FRUs without customer data, fruadm prints
only the container's path.
 Only a privileged user can create or update data in containers. The privileges required to perform these write opera<hy>
tions are hardware dependent. Typically, a default system configuration restricts write operations to the superuser or
to the platform-administrator user.
The following options are supported:
-l List the system's frutree paths.
-r Recursively display or update the data for all containers rooted at the argument path.
The following operands are supported:
path A full or partial system frutree path for or under which to print or set the customer data. The first field of each
line of output of fruadm -l gives the valid full frutree paths for the system.
Paths can include shell meta-characters; such paths should be quoted appropriately for the user's shell. For partial
paths, the first matching full path is selected for display or update. Without the -r option, the path must be that of a
container; with the -r option, all containers (if any) under path will be selected.
text Up to 80 characters of text set as the customer data. If the text contains white space or shell metacharacters, it
should be quoted appropriately for the user's shell.
Example 1 Displaying All Customer Data
The following example prints all customer data available from FRUs on the system. For containers with no customer
data, only the containers' paths will be listed.
 example% fruadm
Example 2 Displaying Customer Data For a Single FRU
The following command prints the customer data, if present, for the specified FRU:
 example% fruadm /frutree/chassis/system-board
Example 3 Displaying Customer Data For a Single FRU
The following command prints the customer data, if present, for the first mem-module found:
 example% fruadm mem-module
Example 4 Setting Customer Data
<beginning of page>
The following example sets the customer data for a FRU:
 example# fruadm system-board 'Asset Tag 123456'
Example 5 Setting Customer Data
The following command sets the customer data for all FRUs under chassis:
 example# fruadm -r /frutree/chassis "Property of XYZ, Inc."
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
