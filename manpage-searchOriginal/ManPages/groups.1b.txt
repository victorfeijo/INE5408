With no arguments, groups displays the groups to which you belong; else it displays the groups to which the user
belongs. Each user belongs to a group specified in the password file /etc/passwd and possibly to other groups as
specified in the file /etc/group. If you do not own a file but belong to the group which it is owned by then you are
granted group access to the file.
