 dat_evd_resize(

evd_handle Handle for an instance of Event Dispatcher.
evd_min_qlen New number of events the Event Dispatcher event queue must hold.
The dat_evd_resize() function modifies the size of the event queue of Event Dispatcher.
Resizing of Event Dispatcher event queue should not cause any incoming or current events on the event queue to be
lost. If the number of entries on the event queue is larger then the requested evd_min_qlen, the operation can return
DAT_INVALID_STATE and not change an instance of Event Dispatcher
DAT_SUCCESS The operation was successful.
DAT_INVALID_HANDLE The evd_handle parameter is invalid.
DAT_INVALID_PARAMETER The evd_min_qlen parameter is invalid
DAT_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES The operation failed due to resource limitations
DAT_INVALID_STATE Invalid parameter. The number of entries on the event queue of the Event Dispatcher ex<hy>
ceeds the requested event queue length.
This operation is useful when the potential number of events that could be placed on the event queue changes dy<hy>
namically.
