nca, snca <-> the Solaris Network Cache and Accelerator (NCA)
The Solaris Network Cache and Accelerator ("NCA") is a kernel module designed to provide improved web server
performance. The kernel module, ncakmod, services HTTP requests. To improve the performance of servicing
HTTP requests, the NCA kernel module maintains an in-kernel cache of web pages. If the NCA kernel module can<hy>
not service the request itself, it passes the request to the http daemon (httpd). It uses either a sockets interface, with
family type designated PF_NCA, or a private Solaris doors interface that is based on the Solaris doors RPC mecha<hy>
nism, to pass the request.
To use the sockets interface, the web server must open a socket of family type PF_NCA. The PF_NCA family sup<hy>
ports only SOCK_STREAM and protocol 0, otherwise an error occurs.
The following features are not presently supported: <bu> You cannot initiate a connection from a PF_NCA type socket.
The connect(3SOCKET) interface on PF_NCA fails. <bu> System calls that are associated with type SO_DGRAM,
such as send(), sendto(), sendmsg(), recv(), recvfrom(), and recvmsg(), fails. <bu> You cannot set TCP or IP options
on a PF_NCA type socket through setsockopt(3SOCKET).
The NCA cache consistency is maintained by honoring HTTP headers that deal with a given content type and expi<hy>
ration date, much the same way as a proxy cache.
For configuration information, see System Administration Guide: IP Services
When native PF_NCA socket support does not exist in the web server, the ncad_addr(4) interface must be used to
provide NCA support in that web server.
NCA is intended to be run on a dedicated web server. Running other large processes while running NCA might
cause undesirable behavior.
NCA supports the logging of in-kernel cache hits. See ncalogd.conf(4). NCA stores logs in a binary format. Use the
ncab2clf(1) utility to convert the log from a binary format to the Common Log File format.
/etc/nca/ncakmod.conf Lists configuration parameters for NCA.
/etc/nca/ncalogd.conf Lists configuration parameters for NCA logging.
/etc/nca/nca.if Lists the physical interfaces on which NCA runs.
/etc/nca/ncaport.conf ncaport configuration file
/etc/hostname.{}{0-9} Lists all physical interfaces configured on the server.
/etc/hosts Lists all host names associated with the server. Entries in this file must match with entries in /etc/host<hy>
name.{}{0-9} for NCA to function.
