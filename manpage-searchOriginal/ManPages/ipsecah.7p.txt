ipsecah, AH <-> IPsec Authentication Header
drv/ipsecah
The ipsecah module (AH) provides strong integrity, authentication, and partial sequence integrity (replay protec<hy>
tion) to IP datagrams. AH protects the parts of the IP datagram that can be predicted by the sender as it will be re<hy>
ceived by the receiver. For example, the IP TTL field is not a predictable field, and is not protected by AH.
AH is inserted between the IP header and the transport header. The transport header can be TCP, UDP, ICMP, or
another IP header, if tunnels are being used.
AH is implemented as a module that is auto-pushed on top of IP. The entry /dev/ipsecah is used for tuning AH with
ndd(1M).
Current authentication algorithms supported include HMAC-MD5 and HMAC-SHA-1. Each authentication algo<hy>
rithm has its own key size and key format properties. You can obtain a list of authentication algorithms and their
properties by using the ipsecalgs(1M) command. You can also use the functions described in the getipsecalgby<hy>
name(3NSL) man page to retrieve the properties of algorithms.
Without replay protection enabled, AH is vulnerable to replay attacks. AH does not protect against eavesdropping.
Data protected with AH can still be seen by an adversary.
