dsstat <-> report Sun StorageTek Availability Suite I/O statistics
dsstat -m mode [-r report-options] [-d display-options]
 [-s volume-sets] [-f | -F] [-z] [interval [count]]
The dsstat command collects and reports I/O statistics for the Sun StorageTek Availability Suite products.
The dsstat supports the following options:
-m mode
Specifies the mode(s) of operation. Valid modes are:
cache
Cache statistics
ii
Point-in-Time Copy statistics
sndr
Remote Mirror statistics
To display statistics for multiple services simultaneously, use the -m switch to specify each of the modes required.
For example:
 % dsstat -m ii -m sndr
 % dsstat -m ii -m sndr -m cache
To determine which statistics are being reported from which service, use the role field, described below. When cache
statistics are requested as one of the multiple services, the rkps and wkps statistics is further divided into crkps,
drkps, cwkps, and dwkps. If no -m switch is specified, then dsstat displays default statistics for all of the valid
modes as described above. See "Field Descriptions," below for descriptions of these fields.
-r report-options
Specifies the volume components to be displayed. Each item is represented by a single character, and multiple items
can be selected. The report-options vary based on the mode(s) specified above. This option is not used for cache
mode.
Valid report-options for ii mode are:
m Master volume statistics. <bu> For the "report-options for ii mode": m, s, b, o <bu> For the "report-options for sndr
mode": b, n <bu> For the "display-options for cache mode": r, w, d, c, s, f <bu> For the "display-options for ii mode": r, w,
t, s, p, f
s Shadow volume statistics.
b Bitmap volume statistics.
o Overflow volume statistics, if attached.
Valid report-options for sndr mode are:
b Bitmap volume statistics.
n Network volume statistics.
<beginning of page>
-d display-options
Specifies the statistics to be displayed. The types of statistics are represented by a single character; multiple types
can be specified.
For cache mode, the valid display-options are:
r Detailed read statistics.
w Detailed write statistics.
s Summary statistics.
f Cache behavior flags.
The following display-options are available only for cache mode, they need to be combined with the mode options
(-m)
d Destaged data statistics.
c Write cancellation statistics.
The default display-options for cache are sf.
For ii mode, the valid display-options are:
r
Detailed read statistics.
w
Detailed write statistics.
t
Timing statistics.
s
Summary statistics.
p
Percentage of volume requiring sync.
f
Volume type/status flags.
The default display-options for ii are spf. For sndr mode, the valid display-options are:
r Detailed read statistics.
w Detailed write statistics.
<beginning of page>
t Timing statistics.
s Summary statistics.
p Percentage of volume requiring sync.
f Volume type/status flags.
q Asynchronous queue statistics.
The following display-option is only available for sndr mode, and needs to be combined with the mode options
(-m).
q Asynchronous queue statistics.
The default display-options for sndr are spf.
Specifying the summary display-option causes r w t display-options to be ignored.
-s volume-sets Filters the output to include only the specified volume-sets, where volume-sets is a comma-delimited
list of volume names. When displaying Remote Mirror statistics, the name specified is compared to the Remote Mir<hy>
ror primary volume to determine if they match. Additionally, an Remote Mirror volume should be specified as
<host>:<volume> where <host> is the primary or secondary host and <volume> is the volume name by which that
host recognizes the volume set. When specifying multiple Remote Mirror volumes sets, be aware that each volume
set specified is evaluated individually, using the rules above. When displaying Point-in-Time Copy statistics, the vol<hy>
ume name specified is compared to the Point-in-Time Copy shadow volume to determine if they match.
-f Output field headers at every reporting cycle.
-F Output field headers once, when reporting begins.
-z Suppress report lines that have zero values or no activity.
The dsstat command line supports the following operands:
interval
Specifies the interval for each report, in seconds. If no interval is specified, a single report with a one second interval
is output.
Due to the varying number of entries in a given set and the varying number of sets, header information might appear
in the middle of a set being reported. To avoid this, use the -f or -F options to display the header information at the
desired time.
count
Specifies the number of reports to generate. If no count is specified, output continues until interrupted.
Unless otherwise specified, all fields are per-second averages based on the data collected during the specified inter<hy>
val.
