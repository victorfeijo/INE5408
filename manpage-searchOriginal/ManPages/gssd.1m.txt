gssd <-> generates and validates GSS-API tokens for kernel RPC
/usr/lib/gss/gssd
gssd is the user mode daemon that operates between the kernel rpc and the Generic Security Service Application
Program Interface (GSS-API) to generate and validate GSS-API security tokens. In addition, gssd maps the GSS-
API principal names to the local user and group ids. By default, all groups that the requested user belongs to will be
included in the grouplist credential. gssd is invoked by the Internet daemon inetd(1m) the first time that the kernel
RPC requests GSS-API services.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred.

The following signal has the specified effect when sent to the server process using the kill(1) command:
SIGHUP gssd rereads the gsscred.conf(4) options.
When one of the mechanisms being used is Kerberos, then the gssd process must be restarted after adding or chang<hy>
ing the resolv.conf(4) file.
The gssd service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/network/rpc/gss:default
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). Responsibility for initiating and restarting this service is delegated to inetd(1M). Use inetadm(1M) to
make configuration changes and to view configuration information for this service. The service's status can be
queried using the svcs(1) command.
