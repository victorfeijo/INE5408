gss_oid_to_str(OM_uint32 *minor_status, const gss_OID oid,

minor_status Status code returned by underlying mechanism.
oid GSS-API OID structure to convert.
oid_str String to receive converted OID.
The gss_oid_to_str() function converts a GSS-API OID structure to a string. You can use the function to convert
the name of a mechanism from an OID to a simple string. This function is a convenience function, as is its comple<hy>
mentary function, gss_str_to_oid(3GSS).
If an OID must be created, use gss_create_empty_oid_set(3GSS) and gss_add_oid_set_member(3GSS) to create
it. OIDs created in this way must be released with gss_release_oid_set(3GSS). However, it is strongly suggested
that applications use the default GSS-API mechanism instead of creating an OID for a specific mechanism.
The gss_oid_to_str() function returns one of the following status codes:
GSS_S_CALL_INACCESSIBLE_READ
A required input parameter could not be read.
GSS_S_CALL_INACCESSIBLE_WRITE
A required output parameter could not be written.
GSS_S_COMPLETE
Successful completion.
GSS_S_FAILURE
The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific GSS status code is defined. The mechanism-spe<hy>
cific status code reported by means of the minor_status parameter details the error condition.

Solaris Security for Developers Guide
This function is included for compatibility only with programs using earlier versions of the GSS-API and should not
be used for new programs. Other implementations of the GSS-API might not support this function, so portable pro<hy>
grams should not rely on it. Sun might not continue to support this function.
