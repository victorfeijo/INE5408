putspent <-> write shadow password file entry
#include <shadow.h>
int putspent(const struct spwd *p, FILE *fp);
The putspent() function is the inverse of getspent(). See getspnam(3C). Given a pointer to a spwd structure creat<hy>
ed by getspent() or getspnam(), putspent() writes a line on the stream fp that matches the format of /etc/shadow.
The spwd structure contains the following members:
 char *sp_namp;
 char *sp_pwdp;
 int sp_lstchg;
 int sp_min;
 int sp_max;
 int sp_warn;
 int sp_inact;
 int sp_expire;
 unsigned int sp_flag;
If the sp_min, sp_max, sp_lstchg, sp_warn, sp_inact, or sp_expire member of the spwd structure is <mi>1, or if
sp_flag is 0, the corresponding /etc/shadow field is cleared.
The putspent() function returns a non-zero value if an error was detected during its operation. Otherwise, it returns
0.
Since this function is for internal use only, compatibility is not guaranteed. For this reason, its use is discouraged. If
used at all, if should be used with putpwent(3C) to update the password file.
