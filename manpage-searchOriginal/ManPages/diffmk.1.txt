diffmk <-> mark differences between versions of a troff input file
diffmk oldfile newfile markedfile
diffmk compares two versions of a file and creates a third version that includes "change mark" (.mc) commands for
nroff(1) and troff(1). oldfile and newfile are the old and new versions of the file. diffmk generates markedfile,
which, contains the text from newfile with troff(1) "change mark" requests (.mc) inserted where newfile differs
from oldfile. When markedfile is formatted, changed or inserted text is shown by | at the right margin of each line.
The position of deleted text is shown by a single *.
See largefile(5) for the description of the behavior of diffmk when encountering files greater than or equal to 2
Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes). Example 1 An example of the diffmk command.
diffmk can also be used in conjunction with the proper troff requests to produce program listings with marked
changes. In the following command line:
 example% diffmk old.c new.c marked.c ; nroff reqs marked.c | pr
the file reqs contains the following troff requests:
 .pl 1
 .ll 77
 .nf
 .eo
 .nh
which eliminate page breaks, adjust the line length, set no-fill mode, ignore escape characters, and turn off hyphen<hy>
ation, respectively.
If the characters | and * are inappropriate, you might run markedfile through sed(1) to globally change them.
See attributes(5) for descriptions of the following attributes:

Aesthetic considerations may dictate manual adjustment of some output. File differences involving only formatting
requests may produce undesirable output, that is, replacing .sp by .sp 2 will produce a "change mark" on the preced<hy>
ing or following line of output.
