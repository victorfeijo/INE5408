ipcrm <-> remove a message queue, semaphore set, or shared memory ID
ipcrm [-z zone] [-m shmid] [-q msqid] [-s semid]
 [-M shmkey] [-Q msgkey] [-S semkey]
ipcrm removes one or more messages, semaphores, or shared memory identifiers.
The following option is supported:
-z zone Keys specified by other options refer to facilities in the specified zone (see zones(5)). The default is the zone
in which the command is executing. This option is only useful when the command is executed in the global zone.
The identifiers are specified by the following options:
-m shmid Removes the shared memory identifier shmid from the system. The shared memory segment and data
structure associated with it are destroyed after the last detach.
-q msqid Removes the message queue identifier msqid from the system and destroys the message queue and data
structure associated with it.
-s semid Removes the semaphore identifier semid from the system and destroys the set of semaphores and data struc<hy>
ture associated with it.
-M shmkey Removes the shared memory identifier, created with key shmkey, from the system. The shared memory
segment and data structure associated with it are destroyed after the last detach.
-Q msgkey Removes the message queue identifier, created with key msgkey, from the system and destroys the mes<hy>
sage queue and data structure associated with it.
-S semkey Removes the semaphore identifier, created with key semkey, from the system and destroys the set of sema<hy>
phores and data structure associated with it.
The details of the removes are described in msgctl(2), shmctl(2), and semctl(2). Use the ipcs command to find the
identifiers and keys.
