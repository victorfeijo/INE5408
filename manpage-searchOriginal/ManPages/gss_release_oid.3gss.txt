gss_release_oid(OM_uint32 *minor_status, const gss_OID *oid);
The gss_release_oid() function deletes an OID. Such an OID might have been created with gss_str_to_oid().
Since creating and deleting individual OIDs is discouraged, it is preferable to use gss_release_oid_set() if it is nec<hy>
essary to deallocate a set of OIDs.
The parameter descriptions for gss_release_oid() are as follows:
minor_status A mechanism-specific status code.
oid The object identifier of the mechanism to be deleted.
gss_release_oid() returns one of the following status codes:
GSS_S_COMPLETE Successful completion.
GSS_S_FAILURE The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific GSS status code is defined.
The mechanism-specific status code reported by means of the minor_status parameter details the error condition.

This function is included for compatibility only with programs using earlier versions of the GSS-API and should not
be used for new programs. Other implementations of the GSS-API might not support this function, so portable pro<hy>
grams should not rely on it. Sun might not continue to support this function.
