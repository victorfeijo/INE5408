mount attaches an ISO 9660 filesystem (the High Sierra file system, hsfs, is a draft predecessor to ISO 9660, so
the name reflects the filesystem's history) to the file system hierarchy at the mount_point, which is the pathname
of a directory. If mount_point has any contents prior to the mount operation, these are hidden until the file system is
unmounted.
If mount is invoked with special or mount_point as the only arguments, mount will search /etc/vfstab to fill in
the missing arguments, including the FSType-specific_options; see mount(1M) for more details.
The hsfs file system supports direct mounting of files containing the file system as well as block devices. See
mount(1M) and lofiadm(1M).
A file system conforming to ISO 9660 can contain extensions that allow it to overcome limitations of the original
ISO 9660:1988 (version 1) standard. The following types of extensions are supported by hsfs:
Rock Ridge extensions
This is the preferred type of extension as it allows file attributes, name length, and types equivalent to those on other
UNIX-style filesystems. Example of supported features are device special files, POSIX permissions, symbolic links,
and filenames of up to 255 bytes in length. Rock Ridge extensions also remove the ISO9660:1988 restriction on
maximum nesting depth for directories (eight levels). hsfs automatically detects the presence of Rock Ridge exten<hy>
sions and uses them, unless mount options are specified to disable the use of Rock Ridge or to use a different exten<hy>
sion.
ISO9660:1999 (version 2) extensions
The first version of ISO9660, released in 1988, supported only uppercase ASCII filenames of no more than 31 char<hy>
acters in length. ISO9660 version 2, released in 1999, provides an extension that allows filenames of at least 207
bytes that can use UTF-8 characters and removes the limitation on the nesting depth for directories. Unlike Rock
Ridge, it does not provide support for UNIX-style file types and file attributes. hsfs automatically detects this exten<hy>
sion and will use it for filename lookup if no Rock Ridge extensions are found on the media.
Joliet extensions
The Joliet extension was devised by Microsoft to allow Unicode (UCS-2) long filenames with CDROM-based me<hy>
dia. It allows filename lengths of up to 110 Unicode characters and does not support UNIX-style file types and at<hy>
tributes. hsfs falls back to using Joliet if such an extension is present and neither Rock Ridge nor ISO9660 version 2
extensions are found.
If filenames are longer than the 64 UCS-2 characters officially allowed by Microsoft (that is, 110 Unicode charac<hy>
ters), they can translate to up to 330 UTF-8 octets. Filenames that translate to more than 255 UTF-8 octets will be
truncated.
generic_options
See mount(1M) for the list of supported options.
-o
Specify hsfs file system specific options. If invalid options are specified, a warning message is printed and the in<hy>
valid options are ignored. The following options are available:
global | noglobal
If global is specified and supported on the file system, and the system in question is part of a cluster, the file system
will be globally visible on all nodes of the cluster. If noglobal is specified, the mount will not be globally visible.
The default behavior is noglobal.

ro
Mount the file system read-only. This option is required.
rr | nrr
Enable (rr) or disable (nrr) the use of Rock Ridge. rr is the default and need not be specified. If you use nrr and
Rock Ridge extensions are present in the file system, ignore them and search for other available extensions or fall
back to plain ISO9660.
vers2 | novers2
Enable or disable the use of ISO9660 version 2 extensions. If vers2 is specified and ISO9660 version 2 extensions
are available, hsfs will use ISO9660 version 2 even if the file system contains the preferred Rock Ridge extensions
as well. If novers2 is specified, it will fall back to using either Joliet extensions or plain ISO9660 even if ISO9660
version 2 extensions are available.
joliet | nojoliet
Enable or disable the use of Joliet extensions. If joliet is specified and Joliet extensions are available, hsfs will use
them even if the file system contains the preferred Rock Ridge and/or ISO9660 version 2 extensions. If nojoliet is
specified, it will fall back to using plain ISO9660.
notraildot
File names on High Sierra file systems consist of a proper name and an extension separated by a '.' (dot) character.
By default, the separating dot is always considered part of the file's name for all file access operations, even if there
is no extension present. Specifying notraildot makes it optional to specify the trailing dot to access a file whose
name lacks an extension.
Exceptions: This option is effective only on file systems for which Rock Ridge, ISO9660 version 2 or Joliet exten<hy>
sions are not active, either because they are not present on the CD-ROM, or they have been deliberately disabled via
the nrr, novers2 and nojoliet option. If either extension is active, hsfs quietly ignores this option.
nomaplcase
File names on High Sierra/ISO9660 CD-ROMs with no extensions present should be uppercase characters only. By
default, hsfs maps file names read from a non-Rock Ridge disk to all lowercase characters. nomaplcase turns off
this mapping. The exceptions for notraildot discussed above apply to nomaplcase.
-O
Overlay mount. Allow the file system to be mounted over an existing mount point, making the underlying file sys<hy>
tem inaccessible. If a mount is attempted on a preexisting mount point without setting this flag, the mount will fail,
producing the error: device busy.

If the directory on which a file system is to be mounted is a symbolic link, the file system is mounted on the directo<hy>
ry to which the symbolic link refers, rather than on top of the symbolic link itself.
