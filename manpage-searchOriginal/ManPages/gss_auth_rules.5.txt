gss_auth_rules <-> overview of GSS authorization
The establishment of the veracity of a user's credentials requires both authentication (Is this an authentic user?) and
authorization (Is this authentic user, in fact, authorized?).
When a user makes use of Generic Security Services (GSS) versions of the ftp or ssh clients to connect to a server,
the user is not necessarily authorized, even if his claimed GSS identity is authenticated, Authentication merely estab<hy>
lishes that the user is who he says he is to the GSS mechanism's authentication system. Authorization is then re<hy>
quired: it determines whether the GSS identity is permitted to access the specified Solaris user account.
The GSS authorization rules are as follows: <bu> If the mechanism of the connection has a set of authorization rules,
then use those rules. For example, if the mechanism is Kerberos, then use the krb5_auth_rules(5), so that authoriza<hy>
tion is consistent between raw Kerberos applications and GSS/Kerberos applications. <bu> If the mechanism of the con<hy>
nection does not have a set of authorization rules, then authorization is successful if the remote user's gssname
matches the local user's gssname exactly, as compared by gss_compare_name(3GSS).
