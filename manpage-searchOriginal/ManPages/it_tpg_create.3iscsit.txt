int it_tpg_create(it_config_t *cfg, it_tpg_t **tpg,
 char *tpg_name, char *portal_ip_port);
int it_tpg_delete(it_config_t *cfg, it_tpg_t *tpg,

void it_tpg_free(it_tpg_t *tpg);
cfg a pointer t the iSCSI configuration structure
tpg a pointer to the it_tpg_t structure representing the target portal group
tpg_name an identifier for the target portal group
portal_ip_port a string containing an appropriately formatted IP address:port. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are
permitted. This value becomes the first portal in the target portal group. Applications can add additional values using
it_portal_create(3ISCSIT) before committing the target portal group. IPv6 addresses should be enclosed in square
brackets ('[', ']').
force boolean value indicating if the target portal group should be removed even if it is associated with one or more
targets. If not B_TRUE, the operation will fail if the target product group is associated with a target.
The it_tpg_create() function allocates and creates an it_tpg_t structure representing a new iSCSI target portal
group. The new it_tpg_t structure is added to the global tpg list (cfg_tgt_list) in the it_config_t structure.
The it_tpg_delete() function deletes the target portal group represented by tpg, where tpg is an existing it_tpg_t
structure within the global configuration cfg.
The it_tpg_free() function deallocates resources associated with an it_tpg_t structure. If tpg->next is not NULL, this
function frees all members of the list.
Configuration changes as a result of these functions are not instantiated until the modified configuration is commit<hy>
ted by calling it_config_commit(3ISCSIT).
The it_tpg_create() and it_tpg_delete() functions return 0 on success and an error value on failure.
The it_tpg_create() and it_tpg_delete() functions will fail if:
EBUSY The portal group is associated with one or more targets.
EEXIST The portal was already configured for another portal group associated with this target.
EINVAL A parameter is invalid.
ENOMEM Resources could not be allocated.
