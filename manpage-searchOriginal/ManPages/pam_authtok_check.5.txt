pam_authtok_check <-> authentication and password management module
pam_authtok_check.so.1
pam_authtok_check provides functionality to the Password Management stack. The implementation of
pam_sm_chauthtok() performs a number of checks on the construction of the newly entered password.
pam_sm_chauthtok() is invoked twice by the PAM framework, once with flags set to PAM_PRELIM_CHECK,
and once with flags set to PAM_UPDATE_AUTHTOK. This module only performs its checks during the first in<hy>
vocation. This module expects the current authentication token in the PAM_OLDAUTHTOK item, the new (to be
checked) password in the PAM_AUTHTOK item, and the login name in the PAM_USER item. The checks per<hy>
formed by this module are:
length The password length should not be less that the minimum specified in /etc/default/passwd.
circular shift The password should not be a circular shift of the login name. This check may be disabled in /etc/de<hy>
fault/passwd.
complexity The password should contain at least the minimum number of characters described by the parameters
MINALPHA, MINNONALPHA, MINDIGIT, and MINSPECIAL. Note that MINNONALPHA describes the
same character classes as MINDIGIT and MINSPECIAL combined; therefore the user cannot specify both MIN<hy>
NONALPHA and MINSPECIAL (or MINDIGIT). The user must choose which of the two options to use. Further<hy>
more, the WHITESPACE parameter determines whether whitespace characters are allowed. If unspecified MI<hy>
NALPHA is 2, MINNONALPHA is 1 and WHITESPACE is yes
variation The old and new passwords must differ by at least the MINDIFF value specified in /etc/default/passwd.
If unspecified, the default is 3. For accounts in name services which support password history checking, if prior his<hy>
tory is defined, the new password must not match the prior passwords.
dictionary check The password must not be based on a dictionary word. The list of words to be used for the site's
dictionary can be specified with DICTIONLIST. It should contain a comma-separated list of filenames, one word
per line. The database that is created from these files is stored in the directory named by DICTIONDBDIR (defaults
to /var/passwd). See mkpwdict(1M) for information on pre-generating the database. If neither DICTIONLIST nor
DICTIONDBDIR is specified, no dictionary check is made.
upper/lower case The password must contain at least the minimum of upper- and lower-case letters specified by the
MINUPPER and MINLOWER values in /etc/default/passwd. If unspecified, the defaults are 0.
maximum repeats The password must not contain more consecutively repeating characters than specified by the
MAXREPEATS value in /etc/default/passwd. If unspecified, no repeat character check is made.
The following option may be passed to the module:
force_check If the PAM_NO_AUTHTOK_CHECK flag set, force_check ignores this flag. The PAM_NO_AU<hy>
THTOK_CHECK flag can be set to bypass password checks (see pam_chauthtok(3PAM)).
debug syslog(3C) debugging information at the LOG_DEBUG level
If the password in PAM_AUTHTOK passes all tests, PAM_SUCCESS is returned. If any of the tests fail,
PAM_AUTHTOK_ERR is returned.

The pam_unix(5) module is no longer supported. Similar functionality is provided by pam_authtok_check(5),

pam_unix_auth(5), and pam_unix_session(5).
