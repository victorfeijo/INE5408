kpropd <-> Kerberos propagation daemon for slave KDCs
/usr/lib/krb5/kpropd [-d] [-f temp_dbfile] [-F dbfile]
 [-p kdb_util] [-P port_number] [-r realm]
 [-s srv_tabfile] [-S] [-a acl_file]
The kpropd command runs on the slave KDC server. It listens for update requests made by kprop(1M) from the
master KDC and periodically requests incremental updates from the master KDC.
When the slave receives a kprop request from the master, kpropd copies principal data to a temporary text file. Next,
kpropd invokes kdb5_util(1M) (unless a different database utility is selected) to load the text file in database for<hy>
mat.
When the slave periodically requests incremental updates, kpropd update its principal.ulog file with any updates
from the master. kproplog(1M) can be used to view a summary of the update entry log on the slave KDC.
kpropd is not configured for incremental database propagation by default. These settings can be changed in the
kdc.conf(4) file:
sunw_dbprop_enable = [true | false]
Enables or disables incremental database propagation. Default is false.
sunw_dbprop_slave_poll = N[s, m, h]
Specifies how often the slave KDC polls for any updates that the master might have. Default is 2m (two minutes).
The kiprop/<hostname>@<REALM> principal must exist in the slave's keytab file to enable the master to authen<hy>
ticate incremental propagation requests from the slave. In this syntax, <hostname> is the slave KDC's host name
and <REALM> is the realm in which the slave KDC resides.
The following options are supported:
-d Enable debug mode. Default is debug mode disabled.
-f temp_dbfile The location of the slave's temporary principal database file. Default is /var/krb5/from_master.
-F dbfile The location of the slave's principal database file. Default is /var/krb5/principal.
-p kdb_util The location of the Kerberos database utility used for loading principal databases. Default is
/usr/sbin/kdb5_util.
-P port_number Specifies the port number on which kpropd will listen. Default is 754 (service name: krb5_prop).
-r realm Specifies from which Kerberos realm kpropd will receive information. Default is specified in
/etc/krb5/krb5.conf.
-s srv_tabfile The location of the service table file used to authenticate the kpropd daemon.
-S Run the daemon in standalone mode, instead of having inetd listen for requests. Default is non-standalone mode.
-a acl_file The location of the kpropd's access control list to verify if this server can run the kpropd daemon. The
file contains a list of principal name(s) that will be receiving updates. Default is /etc/krb5/kpropd.acl.

The kprop service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/network/security/krb5_prop:default
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). Responsibility for initiating and restarting this service is delegated to inetd(1M). Use inetadm(1M) to
make configuration changes and to view configuration information for this service. The service's status can be
queried using the svcs(1) command.
