linkb <-> concatenate two message blocks
#include <sys/stream.h>
void linkb(mblk_t *mp1, mblk_t *mp2);
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI).
The linkb() function creates a new message by adding mp2 to the tail of mp1. The continuation pointer, b_cont, of
mp1 is set to point to mp2.
The following figure describes how the linkb(m1, m2); function concatenates two message blocks, mp1 and mp2:

mp1 The message to which mp2 is to be added. mblk_t is an instance of the msgb(9S) structure.
mp2 The message to be added.
