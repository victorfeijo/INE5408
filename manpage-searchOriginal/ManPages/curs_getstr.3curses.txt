The effect of getstr() is as though a series of calls to getch() were made, until a newline or carriage return is re<hy>
ceived. The resulting value is placed in the area pointed to by the character pointer str. wgetnstr() reads at most n
characters, thus preventing a possible overflow of the input buffer. The user's erase and kill characters are interpret<hy>
ed, as well as any special keys (such as function keys, HOME key, and CLEAR key.)
All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.

Note that getstr(), mvgetstr(), and mvwgetstr() may be macros.
