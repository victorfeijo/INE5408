postreverse <-> reverse the page order in a PostScript file
postreverse [-o list] [-r] [file]
/usr/lib/lp/postscript/postreverse
The postreverse filter reverses the page order in files that conform to Adobe's Version 1.0 or Version 2.0 file struc<hy>
turing conventions, and writes the results on the standard output. Only one input file is allowed and if no file is speci<hy>
fied, the standard input is read.
The postreverse filter can handle a limited class of files that violate page independence, provided all global defini<hy>
tions are bracketed by %%BeginGlobal and %%EndGlobal comments. In addition, files that mark the end of each
page with %%EndPage: label ordinal comments will also reverse properly, provided the prologue and trailer sec<hy>
tions can be located. If postreverse fails to find an %%EndProlog or %%EndSetup comment, the entire file is
copied, unmodified, to the standard output.
Because global definitions are extracted from individual pages and put in the prologue, the output file can be mini<hy>
mally conforming, even if the input file was not.
-o list Select pages whose numbers are given in the comma-separated list. The list contains single numbers N and
ranges N1 <mi> N2. A missing N1 means the lowest numbered page, a missing N2 means the highest. The page range is
an expression of logical pages rather than physical sheets of paper. For example, if you are printing two logical
pages to a sheet, and you specified a range of 4, then two sheets of paper would print, containing four page layouts.
If you specified a page range of 3-4, when requesting two logical pages to a sheet; then only page 3 and page 4 lay<hy>
outs would print, and they would appear on one physical sheet of paper.
-r Do not reverse the pages in file.
Example 1 Examples of postreverse.
o select pages 1 to 100 from file and reverse the pages:
 example% postreverse -o1<mi>100 file
To print four logical pages on each physical page and reverse all the pages:
 example% postprint -n4 file | postreverse
To produce a minimally conforming file from output generated by dpost without reversing the pages:
 example% dpost file | postreverse -r
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
non-zero An error occurred.

No attempt has been made to deal with redefinitions of global variables or procedures. If standard input is used, the
input file will be read three times before being reversed.
