sdpadm <-> SDP system configuration administration
/usr/sbin/sdpadm status | enable | disable
The sdpadm command is used to display the system state of the Sockets Direct Protocol (SDP) protocol. The sd<hy>
padm command can optionally be used to set the state of the SDP protocol. See sdp(7D).
By default the SDP protocol is disabled on the system. It can be enabled by using sdpadm enable.
The following subcommands are supported:
status Displays the system status of the SDP protocol
enable Enables the SDP protocol
disable Disables the SDP protocol
The required privileges to change the state of the SDP protocol are controlled by the network configuration policy. If
a user does not have the correct privileges to set the SDP policy, sdpadm returns the current state of SDP without
having changed the state.
