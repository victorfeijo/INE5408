nca.if <-> the NCA configuration file that specifies physical interfaces
/etc/nca/nca.if
Specify the physical interfaces for which the Solaris Network Cache and Accelerator ("NCA") feature will be con<hy>
figured in the nca.if configuration file. List the physical interfaces in the file, one per line. To configure NCA to lis<hy>
ten on all physical interfaces present on the system backed by a hostname.{interface_name}, then list only an aster<hy>
ik ("*") in nca.if.
When the ncakmod(1) initialization script is invoked during system boot, it will attempt to configure each physical
interface specified in the nca.if file by using ncaconfd(1M). Note that there must be an accompanying host<hy>
name.{interface_name} file and an entry in /etc/hosts for the contents of hostname.{interface_name}.
You must reboot in order to implement changes to the nca.if file. Example 1 nca.if on x86
The following is an example of an nca.if file that would be used on an x86 system:
 iprb1
 iprb6
 iprb8
Example 2 nca.if on SPARC
The following is an example of an nca.if file that would be used on a SPARC system:
 hme2
 hme3
 hme4
Example 3 Configuring NCA to Listen on All Physical Interfaces
The following example shows the contents of an nca.if file that would be used to configure either platform to listen
on all physical interfaces present on the system:
 *
/etc/nca/nca.if Lists the physical interfaces on which NCA will run.
/etc/hostname.{}{0-9} Lists all physical interfaces configured on the server.
/etc/hosts Lists all host names associated with the server. Entries in this file must match with entries in /etc/host<hy>
name.{}{0-9} for NCA to function.
