lookbib <-> find references in a bibliographic database
lookbib database
A bibliographic reference is a set of lines, constituting fields of bibliographic information. Each field starts on a line
beginning with a `%', followed by a key-letter, then a blank, and finally the contents of the field, which may contin<hy>
ue until the next line starting with `%'.
The lookbib utility uses an inverted index made by indxbib to find sets of bibliographic references. It reads
keywords typed after the `>' prompt on the terminal, and retrieves records containing all these keywords. If nothing
matches, nothing is returned except another `>' prompt.
It is possible to search multiple databases, as long as they have a common index made by indxbib(1). In that case,
only the first argument given to indxbib is specified to lookbib.
If lookbib does not find the index files (the .i[abc] files), it looks for a reference file with the same name as the argu<hy>
ment, without the suffixes. It creates a file with a .ig suffix, suitable for use with fgrep (see grep(1)). lookbib then
uses this fgrep file to find references. This method is simpler to use, but the .ig file is slower to use than the .i[abc]
files, and does not allow the use of multiple reference files.

Probably all dates should be indexed, since many disciplines refer to literature written in the 1800s or earlier.
