dev_t makedevice(major_t majnum, minor_t minnum);
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI).
majnum Major device number.
minnum Minor device number.
The makedevice() function creates a device number from a major and minor device number. makedevice() should
be used to create device numbers so the driver will port easily to releases that treat device numbers differently.
The device number, containing both the major number and the minor number, is returned. No validation of the major
or minor numbers is performed.
The makedevice() function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context.
