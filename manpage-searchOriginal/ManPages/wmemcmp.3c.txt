wmemcmp <-> compare wide-characters in memory
#include <wchar.h>
int wmemcmp(const wchar_t *ws1, const wchar_t *ws2, size_t n);
The wmemcmp() function compares the first n wide-characters of the object pointed to by ws1 to the first n wide-
characters of the object pointed to by ws2. This function is not affected by locale and all wchar_t values are treated
identically. The null wide-character and wchar_t values not corresponding to valid characters are not treated spe<hy>
cially.
If n is zero, ws1 and ws2 must be a valid pointers and the function behaves as if the two objects compare equal.
The wmemcmp() function returns an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, accordingly as the object pointed
to by ws1 is greater than, equal to, or less than the object pointed to by ws2.
No errors are defined.
