net_isvalidchecksum <-> verify layer 3 and layer 4 checksums
#include <sys/neti.h>
int net_isvalidchecksum(const net_data_t net, mblk_t *mb);
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
net value returned from a successful call to net_protocol_lookup(9F).
mb the mblk structure holding a packet that is the subject of this query.
The net_isvalidchecksum() function verifies the layer 3 checksum (and, in some case, the layer 4 checksum) in the
packet. If possible, fields that are used by hardware checksum'ing are examined rather than manually verifying that
the checksums are present for packets received from a network interface.
For both IPv4 and IPv6, TCP, UDP and ICMP (including ICMPV6 for IPv6) layer 4 checksums are currently vali<hy>
dated.
The net_isvalidchecksum() function returns:
-1 The network protocol does not support this function.
0 The packet does not contain partial checksums.
1 The packet does contain partial checksums.
The net_isvalidchecksum() function may be called from user, kernel, or interrupt context.
