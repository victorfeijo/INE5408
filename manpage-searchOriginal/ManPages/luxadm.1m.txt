luxadm <-> administer Sun Fire 880 storage subsystem and FC_AL devices
luxadm [options]... subcommand [options]... enclosure
 [,dev] | pathname...
The luxadm program is an administrative command that manages the SENA, Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsys<hy>
tem, and individual Fiber Channel Arbitrated Loop (FC_AL) devices. luxadm performs a variety of control and
query tasks depending on the command line arguments and options used.
The command line must contain a subcommand. The command line may also contain options, usually at least one
enclosure name or pathname, and other parameters depending on the subcommand. You need specify only as many
characters as are required to uniquely identify a subcommand.
Specify the device that a subcommand interacts with by entering a pathname. For the SENA subsystem, a disk de<hy>
vice or enclosure services controller may instead be specified by entering the World Wide Name (WWN) for the de<hy>
vice or a port to the device. The device may also be specified by entering the name of the SENA enclosure, and an
optional identifier for the particular device in the enclosure. The individual FC_AL devices may be specified by en<hy>
tering the WWN for the device or a port to the device.
Specify the device or controller by either a complete physical pathname or a complete logical pathname.
For SENA, a typical physical pathname for a device is:
 /devices/sbus@1f,0/SUNW,socal@1,0/sf@0,0/ssd@w2200002037000f96,
  0:a,raw
For all SENA IBs (Interface Boards) and Sun Fire 880 SES device controllers on the system, a logical link to the
physical paths is kept in the directory /dev/es. An example of a logical link is /dev/es/ses0.
The WWN may be used in place of the pathname to select an FC_AL device, SENA subsystem IB, or Sun Fire 880
internal storage subsystem. The WWN is a unique 16 hexadecimal digit value that specifies either the port used to
access the device or the device itself. A typical WWN value is:
 2200002037000f96
See NOTES for more information on the WWN formats.
For a disk in a Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem, a typical physical pathname is:
 /devices/pci@8,600000/SUNW,qlc@2/fp@0,0/ssd@w2100002037a6303c,0:a
and a typical logical pathname is:
 /dev/rdsk/c2t8d0s2
For individual FC_AL devices, a typical physical pathname is:
 /devices/sbus@3.0/SUNW,socal@d,10000/sf@0,0/ssd@w2200002037049fc3,0:a,raw
and a typical logical pathname is:
 /dev/rdsk/c1t0d0s2
For SENA, a device may be identified by its enclosure name and slotname:
<beginning of page>
 box_name[,fslot_number]
 box_name[,rslot_number]
box_name is the name of the SENA enclosure, as specified by the enclosure_name subcommand. When used with<hy>
out the optional slot_number parameter, the box_name identifies the SENA subsystem IB.
f or r specifies the front or rear slots in the SENA enclosure.
slot_number specifies the slot number of the device in the SENA enclosure, 0-6 or 0-10.
For a Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem, a device may also be identified by its enclosure name and slot name.
However, there is only one set of disks:
 box_name[,sslot_number]
box_name is the name of the Sun Fire 880 enclosure, as specified by the enclosure_name subcommand. When used
without the optional slot_number parameter, box_name identifies the Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem enclo<hy>
sure services device. Use s to specify the disk slot number in the Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem, 0 - 11.
See disks(1M) and devlinks(1M) for additional information on logical names for disks and subsystems.
The following options are supported by all subcommands:
-e Expert mode. This option is not recommended for the novice user.
-v Verbose mode.
Options that are specific to particular subcommands are described with the subcommand in the USAGE section.
The following operands are supported:
enclosure
The box_name of the SENA or Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem.
fibre_channel_HBA_port
The path to the host controller port. A typical path is:
  /devices/pci@8,600000/pci@1/SUNW,qlc@4/fp@0,0:devctl
pathname
The logical or physical path of a SENA IB, Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem, or disk device. pathname can
also be the WWN of a SENA IB, SENA disk, or individual FC_AL device.
display enclosure[,dev]...| pathname...
display -p pathname...
display -r enclosure[,dev]...| pathname...
display -v enclosure[,dev]...| pathname...
Displays enclosure or device specific data.
Subsystem data consists of enclosure environmental sense information and status for all subsystem devices, includ<hy>
ing disks.
Disk data consists of inquiry, capacity, and configuration information.
<beginning of page>
-p Displays performance information for the device or subsystem specified by pathname. This option only applies to
subsystems that accumulate performance information.
-r Displays error information for the FC_AL device specified by the pathname, or, if the path is a SENA, for all de<hy>
vices on the loop. The -r option only applies to SENA subsystems and individual FC_AL devices.
-v Displays in verbose mode, including mode sense data.
download [ -s ] [ -f filename_path ] enclosure...
Download the prom image pointed to the SENA subsystem Interface Board unit or the Sun Fire 880 internal storage
subsystem specified by the enclosure or pathname.
When the SENA's download is complete, the SENA will be reset and the downloaded code executed. If no filename
is specified, the default prom image will be used. The default prom image for the SENA is in the directory
usr/lib/locale/C/LC_MESSAGES and is named ibfirmware
When the Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem's download is complete, the subsystem resets and the downloaded
code begins execution. The default firmware image for the Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem is in: /usr/plat<hy>
form/SUNW,Sun-Fire-880/lib/images/int_fcbpl_fw.
-s Save. The -s option is used to save the downloaded firmware in the FEPROM. If -s is not specified, the download<hy>
ed firmware will not be saved across power cycles.
The -s option does not apply to the Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem as it always stores downloaded firmware
in the flash memory.
When using the -s option, the download subcommand modifies the FEPROM on the subsystem and should be used
with caution.
enclosure_name new_name enclosure | pathname
Change the enclosure name of the enclosure or enclosures specified by the enclosure or pathname. The new name
(new_name) must be 16 or less characters. Only alphabetic or numeric characters are acceptable. This subcommand
applies only to the SENA and the Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem.
failover primary | secondary pathname
Select which Sun Storage T3 storage array partner group controller accesses a given logical volume. If primary is
specified, the logical volume is accessed through the primary controller. If secondary is specified, the logical vol<hy>
ume is accessed through the secondary controller specified by pathname.
fcal_s_download [ -f fcode-file ]
Download the fcode contained in the file fcode-file into all the FC100/S Sbus Cards. This command is interactive
and expects user confirmation before downloading the fcode.
Use fcal_s_download only in single-user mode. Using fcal_s_download to update a host adapter while there is I/O
activity through that adapter will cause the adapter to reset. Newly updated FCode will not be executed or visible un<hy>
til a system reboot.
-f fcode-file When invoked without the -f option, the current version of the fcode in each FC100/S Sbus card is print<hy>
ed.
fcode_download -p
fcode_download -d dir-name
Locate the installed FC/S, FC100/S, FC100/P, or FC100/2P host bus adapter cards and download the FCode files in
<beginning of page>
dir-name to the appropriate cards. The command determines the correct card for each type of file, and is interactive.
User confirmation is required before downloading the FCode to each device.
Use fcode_download to load FCode only in single-user mode. Using fcode_download to update a host adapter
while there is I/O activity through that adapter causes the adapter to reset. Newly updated FCode will not be execut<hy>
ed or visible until a system reboot.
-d dir-name Download the FCode files contained in the directory dir-name to the appropriate adapter cards.
-p Prints the current version of FCode loaded on each card. No download is performed.
inquiry enclosure[,dev ]... | pathname...
Display the inquiry information for the selected device specified by the enclosure or pathname.
insert_device [ enclosure,dev... ]
Assist the user in the hot insertion of a new device or a chain of new devices. Refer to NOTES for limitations on
hotplug operations. This subcommand applies only to the SENA, Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem, and indi<hy>
vidual FC_AL drives. For the SENA, if more than one enclosure has been specified, concurrent hot insertions on
multiple busses can be performed. With no arguments to the subcommand, entire enclosures or individual FC_AL
drives can be inserted. For the SENA or the Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem, this subcommand guides the
user interactively through the hot insertion steps of a new device or chain of devices. If a list of disks was entered it
will ask the user to verify the list of devices to be inserted is correct, at which point the user can continue or quit. It
then interactively asks the user to insert the disk(s) or enclosure(s) and then creates and displays the logical path<hy>
names for the devices.
led enclosure,dev...| pathname...
Display the current state of the LED associated with the disk specified by the enclosure or pathname. This subcom<hy>
mand only applies to subsystems that support this functionality.
led_blink enclosure,dev...| pathname...
Requests the subsystem to start blinking the LED associated with the disk specified by the enclosure or pathname.
This subcommand only applies to subsystems that support this functionality.
led_off enclosure,dev...| pathname...
Requests the subsystem to disable (turn off) the LED associated with the disk specified by the enclosure or path<hy>
name. On a SENA subsystem, this may or may not cause the LED to turn off or stop blinking depending on the state
of the SENA subsystem. Refer to the SENA Array Installation and Service Manual (p/n 802-7573). This subcom<hy>
mand only applies to subsystems that support this functionality.
led_on pathname...
Requests the subsystem to enable (turn on) the LED associated with the disk specified by the pathname. This sub<hy>
command only applies to subsystems that support this functionality.
power_off [ -F ] enclosure[,dev]... | pathname ...
When a SENA is addressed, this subcommand causes the SENA subsystem to go into the power-save mode. The
SENA drives are not available when in the power-save mode. When a drive in a SENA is addressed the drive is set
to the drive off/unmated state. In the drive off/unmated state, the drive is spun down (stopped) and in bypass mode.
This command does not apply to the Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem.
-F The force option only applies to the SENA. Instructs luxadm to attempt to power off one or more devices even if
those devices are being used by this host (and are, therefore, busy).
Warning: Powering off a device which has data that is currently being used will cause unpredictable results. Users
<beginning of page>
should attempt to power off the device normally (without -F) first, only resorting to this option when sure of the con<hy>
sequences of overriding normal checks.
power_on enclosure[,dev]..
Causes the SENA subsystem to go out of the power-save mode, when this subcommand is addressed to a SENA..
When this subcommand is addressed to a drive the drive is set to its normal start-up state. This command does not
apply to the Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem.
probe [ -p ]
Finds and displays information about all attached SENA subsystems, Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystems, and
individual FC_AL devices, including the logical pathname, the WWNs, and enclosure names. This subcommand
warns the user if it finds different SENAs with the same enclosure names.
-p Includes the physical pathname in the display.
qlgc_s_download [ -f fcode-file ]
Download the FCode contained in the file fcode-file into all the FC100/P, FC100/2P PCI host adapter cards. This
command is interactive and expects user confirmation before downloading the FCode to each device. Only use ql<hy>
gc_s_download in single-user mode. Using qlgc_s_download to update a host adapter while there is I/O activity
through that adapter will cause the adapter to reset. Newly updated FCode will not be executed or visible until a sys<hy>
tem reboot.
-f fcode-file When invoked without the -f option, the current version of the FCode in each FC100/P, FC100/2P PCI
card is printed.
release pathname
Release a reservation held on the specified disk. The pathname should be the physical or logical pathname for the
disk.
This subcommand is included for historical and diagnostic purposes only.
remove_device [ -F ] enclosure[,dev]...| pathname...
Assists the user in hot removing a device or a chain of devices. This subcommand can also be used to remove entire
enclosures. This subcommand applies to the SENA, Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsystem, and individual FC_AL
drives. Refer to NOTES for limitations on hotplug operations. For the SENA, Sun Fire 880 internal storage subsys<hy>
tem, and individual FC_AL devices, this subcommand guides the user through the hot removal of a device or de<hy>
vices. During execution it will ask the user to verify the list of devices to be removed is correct, at which point the
user can continue or quit. It then prepares the disk(s) or enclosure(s) for removal and interactively asks the user to
remove the disk(s) or enclosure(s).
For Multi-Hosted disk, the steps taken are: <bu> Issue the luxadm remove_device command on the first host. When
prompted to continue, wait. <bu> Issue the luxadm remove_device command on the secondary hosts. When prompted
to continue, wait. <bu> Continue with the remove_device command on the first host. Remove the device when prompt<hy>
ed to do so. <bu> Complete the luxadm remove_device command on the additional hosts.
-F Instructs luxadm to attempt to hot plug one or more devices even if those devices are being used by this host (and
are, therefore, busy or reserved), to force the hotplugging operation.
Warning: Removal of a device which has data that is currently being used will cause unpredictable results. Users
should attempt to hotplug normally (without -F) first, only resorting to this option when sure of the consequences of
overriding normal hotplugging checks.
<beginning of page>
reserve pathname
Reserve the specified disk for exclusive use by the issuing host. The pathname used should be the physical or logical
pathname for the disk.
This subcommand is included for historical and diagnostic purposes only.
set_boot_dev [ -y ] pathname
Set the boot-device variable in the system PROM to the physical device name specified by pathname, which can be
a block special device or the pathname of the directory on which the boot file system is mounted. The command nor<hy>
mally runs interactively requesting confirmation for setting the default boot-device in the PROM. The -y option can
be used to run it non-interactively, in which case no confirmation is requested or required.
start pathname
Spin up the specified disk(s) in a SENA.
stop pathname...
Spin down the specified disks in a SENA.
The following subcommands are for expert use only, and are applicable only to the SENA, Sun Fire 880 internal
storage subsystem, and fiber channel loops. They should only be used by users that are knowledgeable about the
SENA subsystem and fiber channel loops.
If you specify a disk to an expert subcommand that operates on a bus, the subcommand operates on the bus to which
the specified disk is attached.
-e bypass [-ab] enclosure,dev
-e bypass -f enclosure

See the SENA Array Installation and Service Manual for additional information on the SENA. Refer to Tutorial for
SCSI use of IEEE Company_ID, R. Snively, for additional information regarding the IEEE extended WWN. See
SEE ALSO. Currently, only some device drivers support hot plugging. If hot plugging is attempted on a disk or bus
where it is not supported, an error message of the form:
 luxadm: can't acquire "PATHNAME": No such file or directory
will be displayed.
You must be careful not to quiesce a bus that contains the root or the /usr filesystems or any swap data. If you do
quiesce such a bus a deadlock can result, requiring a system reboot.
