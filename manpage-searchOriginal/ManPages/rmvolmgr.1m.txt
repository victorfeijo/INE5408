rmvolmgr <-> HAL-aware removable volume manager
/usr/sbin/rmvolmgr [-chns]
The rmvolmgr command is a volume manager that can automatically mount and unmount removable media and
hot-pluggable storage. The default mount point is /media.
rmvolmgr is one of a number of Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)-aware tools that are shipped with the Solaris
operating system. See hald(1M).
Multiple instances of rmvolmgr can be run simultaneously. A system instance of rmvolmgr runs by default as a
service management facility (SMF) service (see smf(5)). Its fault management resource identifier (FMRI) is:
 svc:/system/filesystem/rmvolmgr
You can run your own instance of rmvolmgr by adding it to the .xinitrc file or a similar session startup script. In
such a case, the system rmvolmgr instance will not manage volumes that belong to you, the owner of the startup
script. For example, a user logged on to the workstation console (/dev/console) who invokes his own instance of
rmvolmgr will own locally connected devices, such as CD-ROM drives and devices connected to the local USB or
FireWire ports.
In addition to mounting volumes under /media, rmvolmgr also creates legacy symbolic links under /cdrom, /flop<hy>
py, and /rmdisk.
rmvolmgr also provides backwards compatibility with CDE removable media interfaces by maintaining notification
files under /tmp/.removable. This functionality can be disabled by using the -c option.
The -c and -n options can also be specified as SMF properties. See "Examples."
The following options are supported:
-c Disable CDE compatibility.
-h Display help information and exit.
-n Do not create legacy mountpoint symbolic links.
-s Invoke in system instance mode.
Example 1 Using SMF Properties to Set Options
The following svccfg(1M) command and subcommands use SMF properties to set the -c and -n options.
 example# svccfg
 svc:> select rmvolmgr
 svc:/system/filesystem/rmvolmgr> listprop rmvolmgr/*
 rmvolmgr/legacy_mountpoints boolean true
 rmvolmgr/cde_compatible boolean true
 svc:/system/filesystem/rmvolmgr> setprop \
  rmvolmgr/legacy_mountpoints=false
 svc:/system/filesystem/rmvolmgr> setprop rmvolmgr/cde_compatible=false
 svc:/system/filesystem/rmvolmgr> exit
