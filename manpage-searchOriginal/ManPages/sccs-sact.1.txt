sccs-sact, sact <-> show editing activity status of an SCCS file
sact s.filename...
The sact utility informs the user of any SCCS files that are checked out for editing.
The output for each named file consists of five fields separated by SPACE characters. <bu> SID of a delta that currently
exists in the SCCS file, to which changes are made to make the new delta <bu> SID for the new delta to be created <bu>
Username of the person who has the file checked out for editing. <bu> Date that the version was checked out. <bu> Time
that the version was checked out.
If a directory name is used in place of the s.filename argument, the sact command applies to all s.files in that directo<hy>
ry. Unreadable s.files produce an error; processing continues with the next file (if any). The use of `<mi>' as the s.file<hy>
name argument indicates that the names of files are to be read from the standard input, one s.file per line.
See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of sact: LANG,
LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.
