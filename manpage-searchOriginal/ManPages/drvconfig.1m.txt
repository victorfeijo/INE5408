drvconfig <-> apply permission and ownership changes to devices
drvconfig [-bn] [-a alias_name] [-c class_name]
 [-i drivername] [-m major_num] [-r root_dir]
devfsadm(1M) is now the preferred command and should be used instead of drvconfig.
The default operation of drvconfig is to apply permission and ownership changes to devices. Normally, this com<hy>
mand is run automatically after a new driver has been installed (with add_drv(1M)) and the system has been reboot<hy>
ed.
The following options are supported:
-aalias_name Add the name alias_name to the list of aliases that this driver is known by. This option, if used, must
be used with the -m major_num, the -b and the -i drivername options.
-b Add a new major number to name binding into the kernel's internal name_to_major tables. This option is not
normally used directly, but is used by other utilities such as add_drv(1M). Use of the -b option requires that -i and
-m be used also. No /devices entries are created.
-cclass_name The driver being added to the system exports the class class_name. This option is not normally used
directly, but is used by other utilities. It is only effective when used with the -b option.
-idrivername Only configure the devices for the named driver. The following options are used by the implementation
of add_drv(1M) and rem_drv(1M), and may not be supported in future versions of Solaris:
-mmajor_num Specify the major number major_num for this driver to add to the kernel's name_to_major binding
tables.
-n Do not try to load and attach any drivers, or if the -i option is given, do not try to attach the driver named driver<hy>
name.
-rroot_dir Perform operations under root_dir, rather than directly under root.
