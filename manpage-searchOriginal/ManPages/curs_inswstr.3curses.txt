These routines insert a wchar_t character string (as many wchar_t characters as will fit on the line) before the
character under the cursor. All characters to the right of the cursor are moved to the right, with the possibility of the
rightmost characters on the line being lost. The cursor position does not change (after moving to y, x, if specified).
(This does not imply use of the hardware insert character feature.) The four routines with n as the last argument in<hy>
sert at most n wchar_t characters. If n<=0, then the entire string is inserted.
If a character in wstr is a tab, newline, carriage return, or backspace, the cursor is moved appropriately within the
window. A newline also does a clrtoeol(3CURSES) before moving. Tabs are considered to be at every eighth col<hy>
umn. If a character in wstr is another control character, it is drawn in the ^X notation. Calling winwch(3CURSES)
after adding a control character (and moving to it, if necessary) does not return the control character, but instead re<hy>
turns the representation of the control character.
All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.

Note that all but winsnwstr() may be macros.
