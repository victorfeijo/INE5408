In the current version of Solaris, /dev/msglog is an alias for /dev/sysmsg. In future versions of Solaris, writes to
/dev/msglog may be directed into a more general logging mechanism such as syslogd(1M).
syslog(3C) provides a more general logging mechanism than /dev/msglog and should be used in preference to
/dev/msglog whenever possible.
