makedbm [-u dbmfilename]
The makedbm utility takes the infile and converts it to a pair of files in ndbm format (see ndbm(3C)), namely out<hy>
file.pag and outfile.dir. Each line of the input file is converted to a single dbm record. All characters up to the first
TAB or SPACE form the key, and the rest of the line is the data. If a line ends with `\' (backslash), the data for that
record is continued on to the next line. makedbm does not treat `#' (pound-sign) as a special character.
Because makedbm is mainly used in generating dbm files for the NIS name service, it generates a special entry
with the key yp_last_modified, which is the date of infile (or the current time, if infile is `<mi>'). The entries that have
keys with the prefix yp_ are interpreted by NIS server utilities.
The following options are supported:
-b Insert the YP_INTERDOMAIN into the output. This key causes ypserv(1M) to use DNS for host name and
address lookups for hosts not found in the maps.
-d yp_domain_name Create a special entry with the key yp_domain_name.
-D number_of delimiters Specify number_of_delimiters to skip before forming the key.
-E Delimiters are escaped.
-i yp_input_file Create a special entry with the key yp_input_file.
-l Lower case. Convert the keys of the given map to lower case, so that, for example, host name matches succeed in<hy>
dependent of upper or lower case distinctions.
-m yp_master_name Create a special entry with the key yp_master_name. If no master host name is specified,
yp_master_name is set to the local host name.
-o yp_output_name Create a special entry with the key yp_output_name.
-s Secure map. Accept connections from secure NIS networks only.
-S delimiter Specify the delimiter to use instead of the default delimiter for forming the key.
-u dbmfilename Undo a dbm file. Prints out the file in text format, one entry per line, with a single space separating
keys from values.
The following operands are supported:
infile Input file for makedbm. If infile is `<mi>' (dash), the standard input is read.
outfile One of two output files in ndbm format: outfile.pag and outfile.dir.
