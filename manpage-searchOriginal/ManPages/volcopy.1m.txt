volcopy <-> make an image copy of file system
volcopy [-F FSType] [-V] [generic_options]
 [-o FSType-specific_options] operands
volcopy makes a literal copy of the file system. This command may not be supported for all FSTypes.
The following options are supported:
-F FSType Specify the FSType on which to operate. The FSType should either be specified here or be determinable
from /etc/vfstab by matching the operands with an entry in the table. Otherwise, the default file system type speci<hy>
fied in /etc/default/fs will be used.
-V Echo the complete command line, but do not execute the command. The command line is generated by using the
options and arguments provided by the user and adding to them information derived from /etc/vfstab. This option
should be used to verify and validate the command line.
generic_options Options that are commonly supported by most FSType-specific command modules. The following
options are available:
-a Require the operator to respond "yes" or "no" instead of simply waiting ten seconds before the copy is made.
-s (Default) Invoke the DEL if wrong verification sequence.
-o FSType-specific_options Specify FSType-specific options in a comma separated (without spaces) list of subop<hy>
tions and keyword-attribute pairs for interpretation by the FSType-specific module of the command.
The following operands are supported:
operands generally include the device and volume names and are file system specific. A detailed description of the
operands can be found on the FSType-specific man pages of volcopy.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful file system copy
1 An error has occurred.
/etc/vfstab list of default parameters for each file system
/etc/default/fs default local file system type. Default values can be set for the following flags in /etc/default/fs. For
example: LOCAL=ufs.
LOCAL: The default partition for a command if no FSType is specified.
