DAT_RETURN
 dat_psp_free (
 IN DAT_PSP_HANDLE psp_handle
 )
psp_handle Handle for an instance of the Public Service Point.
The dat_psp_free() function destroys a specified instance of the Public Service Point.
Any incoming Connection Requests for the Connection Qualifier on the destroyed Service Point it had been listen<hy>
ing on are automatically rejected by the Provider with the return analogous to the no listening Service Point.
The behavior of the Connection Requests in progress is undefined and left to an implementation. But it must be con<hy>
sistent. This means that either a Connection Requested Event has been generated for the Event Dispatcher associated
with the Service Point, including the creation of the Connection Request instance, or the Connection Request is re<hy>
jected by the Provider without any local notification.
This operation shall have no effect on previously generated Connection Requested Events. This includes Connection
Request instances and, potentially, Endpoint instances created by the Provider.
The behavior of this operation with creation of a Service Point on the same Connection Qualifier at the same time is
not defined. Consumers are advised to avoid this scenario.
Use of the handle of the destroyed Public Service Point in any consequent operation fails.
DAT_SUCCESS The operation was successful.
DAT_INVALID_HANDLE The psp_handle parameter is invalid.
