void nis_ping(nis_name dirname, uint32_t utime, nis_object *dirobj);
nis_result *nis_checkpoint(nis_name dirname);
nis_ping() is called by the master server for a directory when a change has occurred within that directory. The pa<hy>
rameter dirname identifies the directory with the change. If the parameter dirobj is NULL, this function looks up the
directory object for dirname and uses the list of replicas it contains. The parameter utime contains the timestamp of
the last change made to the directory. This timestamp is used by the replicas when retrieving updates made to the di<hy>
rectory.
The effect of calling nis_ping() is to schedule an update on the replica. A short time after a ping is received, typical<hy>
ly about two minutes, the replica compares the last update time for its databases to the timestamp sent by the ping. If
the ping timestamp is later, the replica establishes a connection with the master server and request all changes from
the log that occurred after the last update that it had recorded in its local log.
nis_checkpoint() is used to force the service to checkpoint information that has been entered in the log but has not
been checkpointed to disk. When called, this function checkpoints the database for each table in the directory, the
database containing the directory and the transaction log. Care should be used in calling this function since directo<hy>
ries that have seen a lot of changes may take several minutes to checkpoint. During the checkpointing process, the
service will be unavailable for updates for all directories that are served by this machine as master.
nis_checkpoint() returns a pointer to a nis_result structure. See nis_tables(3NSL). This structure should be freed
with nis_freeresult(). See nis_names(3NSL). The only items of interest in the returned result are the status value
and the statistics.

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
NIS+ to LDAP are available in the current Solaris release. For more information, visit http://www.sun.com/directo<hy>
