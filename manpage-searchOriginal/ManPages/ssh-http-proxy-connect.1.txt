ssh-http-proxy-connect <-> Secure Shell proxy for HTTP
/usr/lib/ssh/ssh-http-proxy-connect [-h http_proxy_host]
 [-p http_proxy_port] connect_host connect_port
A proxy command for ssh(1) that uses HTTP CONNECT. Typical use is where connections external to a network
are only allowed via a proxy web server.
The following options are supported:
-h http_proxy_host Specifies the proxy web server through which to connect. Overrides the HTTPPROXY and
http_proxy environment variables if they are set.
-p http_proxy_port Specifies the port on which the proxy web server runs. If not specified, port 80 is assumed. Over<hy>
rides the HTTPPROXYPORT and http_proxy environment variables if they are set.
The following operands are supported:
http_proxy_host The host name or IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the proxy.
http_proxy_port The numeric port number to connect to on http_proxy_host.
connect_host The name of the remote host to which the proxy web server is to connect you.
connect_port The numeric port number of the proxy web server to connect you to on http_proxy_host.
The recommended way to use a proxy connection command is to configure the ProxyCommand in ssh_config(4)
(see Example 1 and Example 2). Example 3 shows how the proxy command can be specified on the command line
when running ssh(1). Example 1 Setting the proxy from the environment
The following example uses ssh-http-proxy-connect in ssh_config(4) when the proxy is set from the environment:
 Host playtime.foo.com
  ProxyCommand /usr/lib/ssh/ssh-http-proxy-connect \
  playtime.foo.com 22
Example 2 Overriding proxy environment variables
The following example uses ssh-http-proxy-connect in ssh_config(4) to override (or if not set) proxy environment
variables:
 Host playtime.foo.com
  ProxyCommand /usr/lib/ssh/ssh-http-proxy-connect -h webcache \
  -p 8080 playtime.foo.com 22
Example 3 Using the command line
The following example uses ssh-http-proxy-connect from the ssh(1) command line:
 example$ ssh -o'ProxyCommand="/usr/lib/ssh/ssh-http-proxy-connect \
  -h webcache -p 8080 playtime.foo.com 22"' playtime.foo.com

HTTPPROXY Takes the http_proxy_host operand to specify the default proxy host. Overrides http_proxy if both
are set.
HTTPPROXYPORT Takes the http_proxy_port operand to specify the default proxy port. Ignored if HTTP<hy>
PROXY is not set.
http_proxy URL format for specifying proxy host and port.
