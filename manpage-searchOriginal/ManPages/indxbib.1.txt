indxbib <-> create an inverted index to a bibliographic database
indxbib database-file...
indxbib makes an inverted index to the named database-file (which must reside within the current directory), typi<hy>
cally for use by lookbib(1) and refer(1). A database contains bibliographic references (or other kinds of informa<hy>
tion) separated by blank lines.
A bibliographic reference is a set of lines, constituting fields of bibliographic information. Each field starts on a line
beginning with a `%', followed by a key-letter, then a blank, and finally the contents of the field, which may contin<hy>
ue until the next line starting with `%'.
indxbib is a shell script that calls two programs: /usr/lib/refer/mkey and /usr/lib/refer/inv. mkey truncates words
to 6 characters, and maps upper case to lower case. It also discards words shorter than 3 characters, words among
the 100 most common English words, and numbers (dates) < 1000 or > 2099. These parameters can be changed.
indxbib creates an entry file (with a .ia suffix), a posting file (.ib), and a tag file (.ic), in the working directory.

All dates should probably be indexed, since many disciplines refer to literature written in the 1800s or earlier.
indxbib does not recognize pathnames.
