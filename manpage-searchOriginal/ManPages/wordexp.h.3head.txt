#include <wordexp.h>
The <wordexp.h> header defines the structures and symbolic constants used by the wordexp() and wordfree()
functions. See wordexp(3C).
The structure type wordexp_t contains the following members:
 size_t we_wordc /* count of words matched by words */
 char **we_wordv /* pointer to list of expanded words */
 size_t we_offs /* slots to reserve at the beginning
  of we_wordv */
The flags argument to the wordexp() function is the bitwise-inclusive OR of the following flags:
WRDE_APPEND Append words to those previously generated.
WRDE_DOOFFS Number of null pointers to prepend to we_wordv.
WRDE_NOCMD Fail if command substitution is requested.
WRDE_REUSE The pwordexp argument was passed to a previous successful call to wordexp(), and has not been
passed to wordfree(). The result is the same as if the application had called wordfree() and then called wordexp()
without WRDE_REUSE.
WRDE_SHOWERR Do not redirect stderr to /dev/null.
WRDE_UNDEF Report error on an attempt to expand an undefined shell variable.
The following constants are defined as error return values:
WRDE_BADCHAR One of the unquoted characters<em><newline>, '|', '&', ';', '<', '>', '(', ')', '{', '}'<em>appears in
words in an inappropriate context.
WRDE_BADVAL Reference to undefined shell variable when WRDE_UNDEF is set in flags.
WRDE_CMDSUB Command substitution requested when WRDE_NOCMD was set in flags.
WRDE_NOSPACE Attempt to allocate memory failed.
WRDE_NOSYS Reserved.
WRDE_SYNTAX Shell syntax error, such as unbalanced parentheses or unterminated string.
The <wordexp.h> header defines the following type:
size_t As described in <stddef.h>.
