ddi_get_driver_private()
dip Pointer to device information structure to get from.
ddi_set_driver_private()
dip Pointer to device information structure to set.
data Data area address to set.
The ddi_get_driver_private() function returns the address of the device's private data area from the device informa<hy>
tion structure pointed to by dip.
The ddi_set_driver_private() function sets the address of the device's private data area in the device information
structure pointed to by dip with the value of data.
The ddi_get_driver_private() function returns the contents of devi_driver_data. If ddi_set_driver_private() has
not been previously called with dip, an unpredictable value is returned.
These functions can be called from user , interrupt, or kernel context.
