smbiod <-> SMB client I/O daemon
/usr/lib/smbfs/smbiod
smbiod is a helper program that initiates an SMB reconnection, when needed.
When a user runs an smbutil or mount_smbfs command, an smbiod process is started and continues to run until
that user no longer has any SMB client connections. Only one smbiod process runs for each user that has SMB
client connections.
Each smbiod process instantiates a door service on one of the following files: <bu> /tmp/.smbiod-UID file for normal
users <bu> /var/run/smbiod-0 file for superuser
The smbiod daemon has no external, customer-accessible interfaces.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred.
/usr/lib/smbfs/smbiod SMB I/O daemon.
/tmp/.smbiod-UID File on which to instantiate a door service for user UID.
/var/run/smbiod-0 File on which to instantiate a door service for superuser.
