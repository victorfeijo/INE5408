OM_uint32 gss_inquire_mechs_for_name(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
 const gss_name_t input_name,gss_OID_set *mech_types);
The gss_inquire_mechs_for_name() function returns the set of mechanisms supported by the GSS-API that may
be able to process the specified name. Each mechanism returned will recognize at least one element within the inter<hy>
nal name.
Some implementations of the GSS-API may perform this test by checking nametype information contained within
the passed name and registration information provided by individual mechanisms. This means that the mech_types
set returned by the function may indicate that a particular mechanism will understand the name, when in fact the
mechanism would refuse to accept the name as input to gss_canonicalize_name(3GSS), gss_init_sec_con<hy>
text(3GSS), gss_acquire_cred(3GSS), or gss_add_cred(3GSS), due to some property of the name itself rather than
the name-type. Therefore, this function should be used only as a pre-filter for a call to a subsequent mechanism-spe<hy>
cific function.
The parameter descriptions for gss_inquire_mechs_for_name() follow in alphabetical order:
minor_status Mechanism-specific status code.
input_name The name to which the inquiry relates.
mech_types Set of mechanisms that may support the specified name. The returned OID set must be freed by the
caller after use with a call to gss_release_oid_set(3GSS).
The gss_inquire_mechs_for_name() function may return the following status codes:
GSS_S_COMPLETE Successful completion.
GSS_S_BAD_NAME The input_name parameter was ill-formed.
GSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE The input_name parameter contained an invalid or unsupported type of name.
GSS_S_FAILURE The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific GSS status code is defined.
The mechanism-specific status code reported by means of the minor_status parameter details the error condition.
