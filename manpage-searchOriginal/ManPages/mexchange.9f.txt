mblk_t *mexchange(queue_t *wq, mblk_t *mp, size_t size,
 uchar_t type, int32_t primtype);
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
wq Optionally, write queue associated with the read queue to be used on failure (see below).
mp Optionally, the message to exchange.
size Size of the returned message.
type Type of the returned message.
primtype Optionally, a 4 byte value to store at the beginning of the returned message.
The mexchange() function exchanges the passed in message for another message of the specified size and type.
If mp is not NULL, is of at least size bytes, and has only one reference (see dupmsg(9F)), mp is converted to be of
the specified size and type. Otherwise, a new message of the specified size and type is allocated. If allocation fails,
and wq is not NULL, merror(9F) attempts to send an error to the stream head.
Finally, if primtype is not -1 and size is at least 4 bytes, the first 4 bytes are assigned to be primtype. This is chiefly
useful for STREAMS-based protocols such as DLPI and TPI which store the protocol message type in the first 4
bytes of each message.
A pointer to the requested message is returned on success. NULL is returned on failure.
This function can be called from user, kernel or interrupt context.
