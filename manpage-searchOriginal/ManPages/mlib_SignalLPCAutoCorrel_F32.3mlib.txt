 const mlib_f32 *signal, void *state);
The mlib_SignalLPCAutoCorrel_F32() function performs linear predictive coding with autocorrelation method.
In linear predictive coding (LPC) model, each speech sample is represented as a linear combination of the past M
samples.
   M
  s(n) = SUM a(i) * s(n-i) + G * u(n)
   i=1
where s(*) is the speech signal, u(*) is the excitation signal, and G is the gain constants, M is the order of the linear
prediction filter. Given s(*), the goal is to find a set of coefficient a(*) that minimizes the prediction error e(*).
   M
  e(n) = s(n) - SUM a(i) * s(n-i)
   i=1
In autocorrelation method, the coefficients can be obtained by solving following set of linear equations.
   M
  SUM a(i) * r(|i-k|) = r(k), k=1,...,M
  i=1
where
   N-k-1
  r(k) = SUM s(j) * s(j+k)
   j=0
are the autocorrelation coefficients of s(*), N is the length of the input speech vector. r(0) is the energy of the speech
signal.
Note that the autocorrelation matrix R is a Toeplitz matrix (symmetric with all diagonal elements equal), and the
equations can be solved efficiently with Levinson-Durbin algorithm.

The function takes the following arguments:
coeff The linear prediction coefficients.
signal The input signal vector.
state Pointer to the internal state structure.
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
