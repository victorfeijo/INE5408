DNSServiceRefSockFD(DNSServiceRef *sdRef);
Access the underlying UNIXTM domain socket from the initialized DNSServiceRef returned from DNS Service
calls. Applications should only access the underlying UNIX domain socket to poll for results from the mDNS dae<hy>
mon. Applications should not directly read or write to the socket. When results are available, applications should call
DNSServiceProcessResult(). The application is responsible for processing the data on the socket in a timely fash<hy>
ion. The daemon can terminate its connection with a client that does not clear its socket buffer.
The underlying UNIX domain socket descriptor of the DNSServiceRef or -1 is returned in case of error.
