mlib_status mlib_SignalLPCPerceptWeight_F32(mlib_f32 *sigwgt,

The mlib_SignalLPCPerceptWeight_F32() function performs perceptual weighting on input signal.
The perceptual weighting filter is defined as following.
   A(z*r1)
  W(z) = ---------
   A(z*r2)
where A(z) is the inverse filter
   M -i
  A(z) = 1 - SUM a(i) * z
   i=1
See G.723.1, G.728, G.729, G.729A, GSM EFR standards.
The function takes the following arguments:
sigwgt The weighted signal vector.
signal The input signal vector.
lpc The linear prediction coefficients.
r1 The perceptual weighting filter coefficient, it is treated as 1 if 0 is supplied.
r2 The perceptual weighting filter coefficient, it is treated as 1 if 0 is supplied.
state Pointer to the internal state structure.
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
