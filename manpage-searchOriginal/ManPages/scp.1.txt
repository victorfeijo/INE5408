scp <-> secure copy (remote file copy program)
scp [-pqrvBC46] [-F ssh_config] [-S program] [-P port]

 [ [user@]host1:]file1 []... [ [user@]host2:]file2
The scp utility copies files between hosts on a network. It uses ssh(1) for data transfer, and uses the same authentica<hy>
tion and provides the same security as ssh(1). Unlike rcp(1), scp will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are
needed for authentication.
Any file name may contain a host and user specification to indicate that the file is to be copied to/from that host.
Copies between two remote hosts are permitted.
The following options are supported:
-4 Forces scp to use IPv4 addresses only.
-6 Forces scp to use IPv6 addresses only.
-B Selects batch mode. (Prevents asking for passwords or passphrases.)
-c cipher Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfer. This option is directly passed to ssh(1).
-C Compression enable. Passes the -C flag to ssh(1) to enable compression.
-F ssh_config Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for ssh(1.).
-i identity_file Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for RSA authentication is read. This option is di<hy>
rectly passed to ssh(1).
-o ssh_option The given option is directly passed to ssh(1).
-p Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the original file.
-P port Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host. Notice that this option is written with a capital `P', be<hy>
cause -p is already reserved for preserving the times and modes of the file in rcp(1).
-q Disables the progress meter.
-r Recursively copies entire directories.
-S program Specifies the name of the program to use for the encrypted connection. The program must understand
ssh(1) options.
-v Verbose mode. Causes scp and ssh(1) to print debugging messages about their progress. This is helpful in debug<hy>
ging connection, authentication, and configuration problems.
The following operands are supported:
host1, host2,... The name(s) of the host from or to which the file is to be copied.
<beginning of page>
file1, file2,... The file(s) to be copied.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
1 An error occurred.

Generally, use of scp with password or keyboard-interactive authentication method and two remote hosts does not
work. It does work with either the pubkey, hostbased or gssapi-keyex authentication method. For the pubkey au<hy>
thentication method, either private keys not protected by a passphrase, or an explicit ssh agent forwarding have to
be used. The gssapi-keyex authentication method works with the kerberos_v5 GSS-API mechanism, but only if
the GSSAPIDelegateCredentials option is enabled.
