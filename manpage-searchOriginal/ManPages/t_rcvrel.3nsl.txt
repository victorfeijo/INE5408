int t_rcvrel(int fd);
This routine is part of the XTI interfaces which evolved from the TLI interfaces. XTI represents the future evolution
of these interfaces. However, TLI interfaces are supported for compatibility. When using a TLI routine that has the
same name as an XTI routine, the tiuser.h header file must be used. Refer to the TLI COMPATIBILITY section
for a description of differences between the two interfaces.
This function is used to receive an orderly release indication for the incoming direction of data transfer. The argu<hy>
ment fd identifies the local transport endpoint where the connection exists. After receipt of this indication, the user
may not attempt to receive more data by means of t_rcv(3NSL) or t_rcvv(). Such an attempt will fail with t_error
set to TOUTSTATE. However, the user may continue to send data over the connection if t_sndrel(3NSL) has not
been called by the user. This function is an optional service of the transport provider, and is only supported if the
transport provider returned service type T_COTS_ORD on t_open(3NSL) or t_getinfo(3NSL). Any user data that
may be associated with the orderly release indication is discarded when t_rcvrel() is called.
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned. Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and t_errno is set to in<hy>
dicate an error.
T_DATAXFER, T_OUTREL.
On failure, t_errno is set to one of the following:
TBADF The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.
TLOOK An asynchronous event has occurred on this transport endpoint and requires immediate attention.
TNOREL No orderly release indication currently exists on the specified transport endpoint.
TNOTSUPPORT This function is not supported by the underlying transport provider.
TOUTSTATE The communications endpoint referenced by fd is not in one of the states in which a call to this func<hy>
tion is valid.
TPROTO This error indicates that a communication problem has been detected between XTI and the transport
provider for which there is no other suitable XTI error (t_errno).
TSYSERR A system error has occurred during execution of this function.
The XTI and TLI interface definitions have common names but use different header files. This, and other semantic
differences between the two interfaces are described in the subsections below.
The XTI interfaces use the header file, xti.h. TLI interfaces should not use this header. They should use the header:
 #include<tiuser.h>
The t_errno values that can be set by the XTI interface and cannot be set by the TLI interface are:
 TPROTO
 TOUTSTATE
