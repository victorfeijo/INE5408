slpd <-> Service Location Protocol Daemon
/usr/lib/inet/slpd [-f configuration-file]
The slpd daemon provides common server functionality for the Service Location Protocol ("SLP") versions 1 and 2,
as defined by IETF in RFC 2165 and RFC 2608. SLP provides a scalable framework for the discovery and selection
of network services.
slpd provides the following framework services:
Directory Agent
This service automatically caches service advertisements from service agents to provide them to user agents, and
makes directory agent advertisements of its services. This service is optional. slpd does not provide directory agent
service by default. Directory agents are not databases, and they do not need to be maintained.
Service Agent Server
All service agents on the local host register and deregister with this server. This service responds to all requests for
services, and forwards registrations to directory agents. By default, slpd is a service agent server.
Passive Directory Agent Discovery
This service listens for directory agent advertisements and maintains a table of active directory agents. When a user
agent wishes to discover a directory agent, it can simply query slpd, obviating the need to perform discovery by
means of multicast. By default, slpd performs this service.
Proxy Registration
This service can act as a proxy service agent for services that cannot register themselves. slpd reads the proxy regis<hy>
tration file for information on services it is to proxy. By default, no services are registered by proxy.
All configuration options are available from the configuration file. slpd reads its configuration file upon startup.
Stop and start the slpd daemon using svcadm(1M). Use the command svcadm enable network/slp to start the slpd
daemon. Use the command svcadm disable network/slp to stop it.
The file /etc/inet/slp.conf must exist before the slp service can start the daemon. Only the example file /etc/in<hy>
et/slp.conf.example is present by default. To enable SLP, copy /etc/inet/slp.conf.example to /etc/inet/slp.conf.
The following options are supported:
-f configuration-file Specify an alternate configuration file
Example 1 Stopping the slpd daemon
The following command stops the slpd daemon:
 example# svcadm disable network/slp
Example 2 Restarting the slpd daemon
The following command restarts the slpd daemon:
 example# svcadm restart network/slp

The slpd service is managed by the service management facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:
 svc:/network/slp
Administrative actions on this service, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using sv<hy>
cadm(1M). The service's status can be queried using the svcs(1) command.
