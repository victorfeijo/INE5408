mlib_status mlib_ImageThresh4_Inp(mlib_image *srcdst,
 const mlib_s32 *thigh, const mlib_s32 *tlow, const mlib_s32 *ghigh,
 const mlib_s32 *glow);
The mlib_ImageThresh4_Inp() function compares each pixel in the source image to two threshold values, tlow and
thigh. If the pixel is less than the lower threshold value, tlow, then the destination pixel is set to the lower output lev<hy>
el, glow. If the pixel is greater than the higher threshold value, thigh, then the destination pixel is set to the higher
output level, ghigh. Otherwise, the destination pixel is set to the value of the source pixel.
It uses the following equation:
 srcdst[x][y][i] = glow[i] if srcdst[x][y][i] < tlow[i]
 srcdst[x][y][i] = ghigh[i] if srcdst[x][y][i] > thigh[i]
The function takes the following arguments:
srcdst Pointer to source and destination image.
thigh High threshold value. thigh[i] holds the high threshold for channel i.
tlow Low threshold value. tlow[i] holds the low threshold for channel i.
ghigh High output grayscale level. ghigh[i] holds the high output grayscale level for channel i.
glow Low output grayscale level. glow[i] holds the low output grayscale level for channel i.
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
