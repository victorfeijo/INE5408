DNSServiceErrorType DNSServiceProcessResult (DNSServiceRef sdRef);
The DNSServiceProcessResult() call reads the returned results from the mDNS daemon and invokes the specified
application callback. The sdRef points to a DNSServiceRef initialized by any of the DNSService calls that take a
callback parameter. The DNSServiceProcessResult() call blocks until data is received from the mDNS daemon.
The application is responsible for ensuring that DNSServiceProcessResult() is called whenever there is a reply from
the daemon. The daemon may terminate its connection with a client that does not process the daemon's responses.
The DNSServiceProcessResult() call returns kDNSServiceErr_NoError on success. Otherwise, an error code de<hy>
fined in <dns_sd.h> is returned to indicate the specific failure that has occurred.
