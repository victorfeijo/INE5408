int feraiseexcept(int excepts);
The feraiseexcept() function attempts to raise the supported floating-point exceptions represented by the excepts ar<hy>
gument. The order in which these floating-point exceptions are raised is unspecified.
If excepts is 0 or if all the specified exceptions were successfully raised, feraiseexcept() returns 0. Otherwise, it re<hy>
turns a non-zero value.
No errors are defined.
The effect is intended to be similar to that of floating-point exceptions raised by arithmetic operations. Hence, en<hy>
abled traps for floating-point exceptions raised by this function are taken.
