int stmfOfflineTarget(stmfDevid *target);
target The identifier of the target port to offline.
The stmfOfflineTarget() function takes offline a target port that is currently in the online state. Once in the offline
state, the target port will no longer be capable of servicing requests in the system.
This API call can be used to take offline a target port device for servicing. Once the target port is offline, it will no
longer be available to any entities outside of the SCSI Target Mode Framework. Any initiator ports that currently
have sessions established by the offlined target port will be logged out.
The following values are returned:
STMF_ERROR_BUSY The device is currently busy.
STMF_STATUS_SUCCESS The API call was successful.
