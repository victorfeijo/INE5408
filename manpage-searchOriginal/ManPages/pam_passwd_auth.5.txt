pam_passwd_auth <-> authentication module for password
pam_passwd_auth.so.1
pam_passwd_auth provides authentication functionality to the password service as implemented by passwd(1). It
differs from the standard PAM authentication modules in its prompting behavior. It should be the first module on the
password service authentication stack.
The name of the user whose password attributes are to be updated must be present in the PAM_USER item. This
can be accomplished due to a previous call to pam_start(3PAM), or explicitly set by pam_set_item(3PAM). Based
on the current user-id and the repository that is to by updated, the module determines whether a password is neces<hy>
sary for a successful update of the password repository, and if so, which password is required.
The following options can be passed to the module:
debug syslog(3C) debugging information at the LOG_DEBUG level
nowarn Turn off warning messages
server_policy If the account authority for the user, as specified by PAM_USER, is a server, do not apply the Unix
policy from the passwd entry in the name service switch.
The following error codes are returned:
PAM_BUF_ERR Memory buffer error
PAM_IGNORE Ignore module, not participating in result
PAM_SUCCESS Successfully obtains authentication token
PAM_SYSTEM_ERR System error

The interfaces in libpam(3LIB) are MT-Safe only if each thread within the multi-threaded application uses its own
PAM handle.
This module relies on the value of the current real UID, this module is only safe for MT-applications that don't
change UIDs during the call to pam_authenticate(3PAM).
The pam_unix(5) module is no longer supported. Similar functionality is provided by pam_authtok_check(5),
pam_authtok_get(5), pam_authtok_store(5), pam_dhkeys(5), pam_passwd_auth(5), pam_unix_account(5),
pam_unix_auth(5), and pam_unix_session(5).
