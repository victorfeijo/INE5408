/usr/sbin/mixerctl [-a | -d dev] [-iv] [-C]
/usr/sbin/mixerctl [-a | -d dev] [-v] -c control [-w value]
/usr/sbin/mixerctl [-a | -d dev] [-f] [-s file | -r file]
The mixerctl command is used to control various features of the audio mixer and to get information about the audio
mixer and the audio device.
The following options are supported. If no options are specified, option -i is assumed:
-a The command applies to all audio devices.
-c control Indicates a control to access. If -w is not supplied, the information about the control, including its current
value, are printed.
-C Prints a dump of the entire set of controls for the audio device including current and possible settings for each
control.
-d dev The dev argument specifies an alternate audio control device for the command to use.
-i Prints the audio device type information for the device and other related details.
-s file Saves control values to file.
-r file Restores control values previously saved to file.
-w value Changes the setting of the named control to the given value. The format of the value depends on the type of
the control.
For boolean controls, the value can be either 'on' or 'off'. For enumerations, value is one of the possible strings giv<hy>
en in the control information. For stereo values, value takes the form of either a pair of integers (0-100, inclusive)
separated by a colon or a single integer by itself. If two integers are supplied, they refer to the left and right values,
respectively. If only a single value is supplied, then value applies to both channels.
For example, 50:100 means 50% volume on the left channel and full volume on the right. A value of 0 means si<hy>
lence on both channels. For monophonic (mono) values, the number is a single integer from 0-100, inclusive.
-v Verbose mode. Prints additional information about the device and operation being performed. This option implies
the -i option.
AUDIODEV If the -d and -a options are not specified, the AUDIODEV environment variable is consulted. If set,
AUDIODEV contains the full path name of the user's default audio device. The default audio device is converted in<hy>
to a control device, and then used. If the AUDIODEV variable is not set, /dev/audioctl is used.
