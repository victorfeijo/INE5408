hwahc <-> Host Wire Adapter Host Controller Driver
The hwahc driver is a USBA (Solaris USB Architecture) compliant nexus driver that supports the Wireless USB 1.0
Host Wire Adapter Host Controller, an industry standard developed by USB-IF.
A Host Wire Adapter (HWA) is a USB device whose upstream connection is a USB 2.0 wired interface. The HWA
operates as a host to a cluster of downstream Wireless USB devices.
The hwahc driver supports bulk, interrupt and control transfers.
