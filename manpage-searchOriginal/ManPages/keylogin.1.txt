keylogin <-> decrypt and store secret key with keyserv
/usr/bin/keylogin [-r]
The keylogin command prompts for a password, and uses it to decrypt the user's secret key. The key can be found in
the /etc/publickey file (see publickey(4)) or the NIS map ``publickey.byname'' or the NIS+ table ``cred.org_dir''
in the user's home domain. The sources and their lookup order are specified in the /etc/nsswitch.conf file. See nss<hy>
witch.conf(4). Once decrypted, the user's secret key is stored by the local key server process, keyserv(1M). This
stored key is used when issuing requests to any secure RPC services, such as NFS or NIS+. The program keylo<hy>
gout(1) can be used to delete the key stored by keyserv .
keylogin fails if it cannot get the caller's key, or the password given is incorrect. For a new user or host, a new key
can be added using newkey(1M), nisaddcred(1M), or nisclient(1M).
If multiple authentication mechanisms are configured for the system, each of the configured mechanism's secret key
is decrypted and stored by keyserv(1M). See nisauthconf(1M) for information on configuring multiple authentica<hy>
tion mechanisms.
The following options are supported:
-r Update the /etc/.rootkey file. This file holds the unencrypted secret key of the superuser. Only the superuser can
use this option. It is used so that processes running as superuser can issue authenticated requests without requiring
that the administrator explicitly run keylogin as superuser at system startup time. See keyserv(1M). The -r option
should be used by the administrator when the host's entry in the publickey database has changed, and the
/etc/.rootkey file has become out-of-date with respect to the actual key pair stored in the publickey database. The
permissions on the /etc/.rootkey file are such that it can be read and written by the superuser but by no other user on
the system.
If multiple authentication mechanisms are configured for the system, each of the configured mechanism's secret keys
is stored in the /etc/.rootkey file.

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
NIS+ to LDAP are available in the current Solaris release. For more information, visit http://www.sun.com/directo<hy>
