uustat -t system [-c] [-d number]
The uustat utility functions in the following three areas: 1. Displays the general status of, or cancels, previously
specified uucp commands. 2. Provides remote system performance information, in terms of average transfer rates
or average queue times. 3. Provides general remote system-specific and user-specific status of uucp connections to
other systems.
The following options are supported:
These options obtain general status of, or cancel, previously specified uucp commands:
-a Lists all jobs in queue.
-j Lists the total number of jobs displayed. The -j option can be used in conjunction with the -a or the -s option.
-kjobid Kills the uucp request whose job identification is jobid. The killed uucp request must belong to the user is<hy>
suing the uustat command unless the user is the super-user or uucp administrator. If the job is killed by the super-us<hy>
er or uucp administrator, electronic mail is sent to the user.
-m Reports the status of accessibility of all machines.
-n Suppresses all standard output, but not standard error. The -n option is used in conjunction with the -k and -r op<hy>
tions.
-p Executes the command ps -flp for all the process-ids that are in the lock files.
-q Lists the jobs queued for each machine. If a status file exists for the machine, its date, time and status information
are reported. In addition, if a number appears in parentheses next to the number of C or X files, it is the age in days
of the oldest C./X. file for that system. The Retry field represents the number of hours until the next possible call.
The Count is the number of failure attempts. Note: For systems with a moderate number of outstanding jobs, this
could take 30 seconds or more of real-time to execute. An example of the output produced by the -q option is:
 eagle 3C 04/07-11:07 NO DEVICES AVAILABLE
 mh3bs3 2C 07/07-10:42 SUCCESSFUL
This indicates the number of command files that are waiting for each system. Each command file may have zero or
more files to be sent (zero means to call the system and see if work is to be done). The date and time refer to the pre<hy>
vious interaction with the system followed by the status of the interaction.
-rjobid Rejuvenates jobid. The files associated with jobid are touched so that their modification time is set to the
current time. This prevents the cleanup daemon from deleting the job until the jobs' modification time reaches the
limit imposed by the daemon.
These options provide remote system performance information, in terms of average transfer rates or average queue
times. The -c and -d options can only be used in conjunction with the -t option:
-tsystem Reports the average transfer rate or average queue time for the past 60 minutes for the remote system. The
following parameters can only be used with this option:
<beginning of page>
-c Average queue time is calculated when the -c parameter is specified and average transfer rate when -c is not speci<hy>
fied. For example, the command:
 example% uustat -teagle -d50 -c
produces output in the following format:
 average queue time to eagle for last 50 minutes:
  5 seconds
The same command without the -c parameter produces output in the following format:
 average transfer rate with eagle for last 50 minutes:
  2000.88 bytes/sec
-dnumber number is specified in minutes. Used to override the 60 minute default used for calculations. These calcu<hy>
lations are based on information contained in the optional performance log and therefore may not be available. Cal<hy>
culations can only be made from the time that the performance log was last cleaned up.
These options provide general remote system-specific and user-specific status of uucp connections to other systems.
Either or both of the following options can be specified with uustat. The -j option can be used in conjunction with
the -s option to list the total number of jobs displayed:
-ssystem Reports the status of all uucp requests for remote system system.
-uuser Reports the status of all uucp requests issued by user.
Output for both the -s and -u options has the following format:
 eagleN1bd7 4/07-11:07 S eagle dan 522 /home/dan/A
 eagleC1bd8 4/07-11:07 S eagle dan 59 D.3b2al2ce4924
  4/07-11:07 S eagle dan rmail mike
With the above two options, the first field is the jobid of the job. This is followed by the date/time. The next field is
an S if the job is sending a file or an R if the job is requesting a file. The next field is the machine where the file is to
be transferred. This is followed by the user-id of the user who queued the job. The next field contains the size of the
file, or in the case of a remote execution (rmail is the command used for remote mail), the name of the command.
When the size appears in this field, the file name is also given. This can either be the name given by the user or an
internal name (for example, D.3b2alce4924) that is created for data files associated with remote executions (rmail in
this example).
-Sqric Reports the job state:
q for queued jobs
r for running jobs
i for interrupted jobs
c for completed jobs
A job is queued if the transfer has not started. A job is running when the transfer has begun. A job is interrupted if
the transfer began but was terminated before the file was completely transferred. A completed job is a job that suc<hy>
<beginning of page>
cessfully transferred. The completed state information is maintained in the accounting log, which is optional and
therefore may be unavailable. The parameters can be used in any combination, but at least one parameter must be
specified. The -S option can also be used with -s and -u options. The output for this option is exactly like the output
for -s and -u except that the job states are appended as the last output word. Output for a completed job has the fol<hy>
lowing format:
 eagleC1bd3 completed
When no options are given, uustat writes to standard output the status of all uucp requests issued by the current us<hy>
er.
See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of uustat: LANG,
LC_ALL, LC_COLLATELC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, LC_TIME, NLSPATH, and TZ.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred.
/var/spool/uucp/* spool directories
/var/uucp/.Admin/account accounting log
/var/uucp/.Admin/perflog performance log

The -t option produces no message when the data needed for the calculations is not being recorded.
After the user has issued the uucp request, if the file to be transferred is moved, deleted or was not copied to the
spool directory (-C option) when the uucp request was made, uustat reports a file size of <mi>99999. This job will
eventually fail because the file(s) to be transferred can not be found.
