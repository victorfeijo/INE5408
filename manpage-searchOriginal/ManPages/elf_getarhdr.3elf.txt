Elf_Arhdr *elf_getarhdr(Elf *elf);
elf_getarhdr() returns a pointer to an archive member header, if one is available for the ELF descriptor elf. Other<hy>
wise, no archive member header exists, an error occurred, or elf was null; elf_getarhdr() then returns a null value.
The header includes the following members.
 char *ar_name;
 time_t ar_date;
 uid_t ar_uid;
 gid_t ar_gid;
 mode_t ar_mode;
 off_t ar_size;
 char *ar_rawname;
An archive member name, available through ar_name, is a null-terminated string, with the ar format control charac<hy>
ters removed. The ar_rawname member holds a null-terminated string that represents the original name bytes in the
file, including the terminating slash and trailing blanks as specified in the archive format.
In addition to ``regular'' archive members, the archive format defines some special members. All special member
names begin with a slash (/), distinguishing them from regular members (whose names may not contain a slash).
These special members have the names (ar_name) defined below.
/ This is the archive symbol table. If present, it will be the first archive member. A program may access the archive
symbol table through elf_getarsym(). The information in the symbol table is useful for random archive processing
(see elf_rand() on elf_begin(3ELF)).
// This member, if present, holds a string table for long archive member names. An archive member's header con<hy>
tains a 16-byte area for the name, which may be exceeded in some file systems. The library automatically retrieves
long member names from the string table, setting ar_name to the appropriate value.
Under some error conditions, a member's name might not be available. Although this causes the library to set
ar_name to a null pointer, the ar_rawname member will be set as usual.
