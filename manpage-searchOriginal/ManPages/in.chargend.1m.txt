in.chargend <-> UDP or TCP character generator service daemon
in.chargend
FMRI svc:/internet/chargen:default
FMRI stands for Fault Management Resource Identifier. It is used to identify resources managed by the Fault Man<hy>
ager. See fmd(1M) and smf(5).
The in.chargend service provides the server-side of the character-generator protocol. This protocol is used for de<hy>
bugging and bandwidth measurement and is available on both TCP and UDP transports, through port 19.
The in.chargend service is an inetd(1M) smf(5) delegated service. The in.chargend detects which transport is re<hy>
quested by examining the socket it is passed by the inetd daemon.
TCP-based service Once a connection is established, the in.chargend generates a stream of data. Any data received
is discarded. The server generates data until the client program terminates the connection. Note that the data flow is
limited by TCP flow control mechanisms.
UDP-based service The in.chargend listens for UDP datagrams. When a datagram is received, the server generates
a UDP datagram in response containing a random number of ASCII characters (ranging from 0 to 512 characters).
Any received data is ignored.
The in.chargend data consists of a pattern of 72 character lines containing the printable, 7-bit ASCII characters.
Each line is terminated with a carriage return and a line feed character.
