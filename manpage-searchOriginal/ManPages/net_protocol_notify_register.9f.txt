family value returned from net_protocol_lookup().
callback function to call when a change occurs.
arg pointer to pass into the callback() function when a change occurs.
The net_protocol_notify_register() function registers a function represented by the pointer callback to be called
when there is a change to the protocol represented by family. The types of changes for which notifications are avail<hy>
able for is currently limited to the addition and removal of protocols.
The net_protocol_notify_unregister() function removes the function specified by the pointer callback from the list
of functions to call. This call may fail if the specified function cannot be found.
Multiple callback functions may be registered through this interface. The same set of parameters is passed to each
callback function. The memory referenced through the pointers passed to the callback should be treated as pointing
to read-only memory. Changing this data is strictly prohibited.
The function that is called must not block any other protocols.
The arguments passed through to the callback are as follows (the command is either HN_REGISTER or HN_UN<hy>
REGISTER):
name1 is the name of the protocol
name2 is NULL.
name3 is the name of the protocol being added/removed
If these functions succeed, 0 is returned. Otherwise, the following error is returned:
EEXIST the given callback function is already registered.
These functions may be called from user or kernel context.
