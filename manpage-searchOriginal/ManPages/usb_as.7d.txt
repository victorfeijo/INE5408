sound@unit-address
The usb_as driver is a USBA (Solaris USB Architecture) compliant client driver that supports the USB Audio Class
1.0 specification.
The usb_as driver processes audio data messages during play and record and sets sample frequency, precision, en<hy>
coding and other functions on request from the USB audio control driver. See usb_ac(7D).
This driver is plumbed under the USB audio control driver and does not directly interface with the user application.

where <device path> is the physical path to the device in /devices directory.
No bandwidth available.
There is no bandwidth available for the isochronous pipe. As a result, no data is transferred during play and record.
Operating a full/high speed audio device on a high speed port is not supported.
The USB software does not currently support full or high speed audio devices connected to an external USB 2.0 hub
that is linked to a port of a USB 2.0 host controller. Audio devices must be connected directly to a port of a USB 2.0
controller or to any USB 1.1 port.
Cannot access device. Please reconnect <name>.
There was an error in accessing the device during reconnect. Please reconnect the device.
Device is not identical to the previous one on this port. Please disconnect and reconnect.
A USB audio streaming interface was hot-removed while open. A new device was hot-inserted which is not identical
to the original USB audio device. Please disconnect the USB device and reconnect the device to the same port.
