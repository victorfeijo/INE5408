linkblk <-> STREAMS data structure sent to multiplexor drivers to indicate a link
#include <sys/stream.h>
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI)
The linkblk structure is used to connect a lower Stream to an upper STREAMS multiplexor driver. This structure
is used in conjunction with the I_LINK, I_UNLINK, P_LINK, and P_UNLINK ioctl commands. See
streamio(7I). The M_DATA portion of the M_IOCTL message contains the linkblk structure. Note that the
linkblk structure is allocated and initialized by the Stream head as a result of one of the above ioctl commands.
 queue_t *l_qtop; /* lowest level write queue of upper stream */
  /* (set to NULL for persistent links) */
 queue_t *l_qbot; /* highest level write queue of lower stream */
 int l_index; /* index for lower stream. */
