msgpullup <-> concatenate bytes in a message
#include <sys/stream.h>
mblk_t *msgpullup(mblk_t *mp, ssize_t len);
Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI).
mp Pointer to the message whose blocks are to be concatenated.
len Number of bytes to concatenate.
The msgpullup() function concatenates and aligns the first len data bytes of the message pointed to by mp, copying
the data into a new message. Any remaining bytes in the remaining message blocks will be copied and linked onto
the new message. The original message is unaltered. If len equals <mi>1, all data are concatenated. If len bytes of the
same message type cannot be found, msgpullup() fails and returns NULL.
The msgpullup function returns the following values:
Non-null Successful completion. A pointer to the new message is returned.
NULL An error occurred.
The msgpullup() function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context.
srv(9E), allocb(9F), pullupmsg(9F), msgb(9S)

STREAMS Programming Guide
The msgpullup() function is a DKI-compliant replacement for the older pullupmsg(9F) routine. Users are strongly
encouraged to use msgpullup() instead of pullupmsg(9F).
