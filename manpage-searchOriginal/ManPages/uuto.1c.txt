uuto, uupick <-> public UNIX-to-UNIX system file copy
uuto [-mp] source-file... destination
uupick [-s system]
uuto sends source-file to destination. uuto uses the uucp(1C) facility to send files, while it allows the local system
to control the file access. A source-file name is a path name on your machine. Destination has the form:
system[!system] ... !user
where system is taken from a list of system names that uucp knows about. User is the login name of someone on
the specified system.
The files (or sub-trees if directories are specified) are sent to PUBDIR on system, where PUBDIR is a public direc<hy>
tory defined in the uucp source. By default, this directory is /var/spool/uucppublic. Specifically the files are sent to
PUBDIR/receive/user/mysystem/files.
The recipient is notified by mail(1) of the arrival of files.
uupick accepts or rejects the files transmitted to the user. Specifically, uupick searches PUBDIR for files destined
for the user. For each entry (file or directory) found, the following message is printed on standard output:
from system sysname: [file file-name] [dir dirname] ?
uupick then reads a line from standard input to determine the disposition of the file:
<new-line> Go to next entry.
d Delete the entry.
m [ dir ] Move the entry to named directory dir. If dir is not specified as a complete path name (in which $HOME
is legitimate), a destination relative to the current directory is assumed. If no destination is given, the default is the
current directory.
a [ dir ] Same as m above, except it moves all the files sent from system.
p Print the content of the file.
q Stop.
EOT (control-d) Same as q.
!command Escape to the shell to do command.
* Print a command summary.
The following options are supported by uuto:
-m Send mail to the sender when the copy is complete.
-p Copy the source file into the spool directory before transmission.
The following option is supported by uupick:
<beginning of page>
-s system Search only the PUBDIR for files sent from system.
The following operands are supported for uuto:
destination A string of the form:
system-name!user
where system-name is taken from a list of system names that uucp knows about; see uuname. The argument user is
the login name of someone on the specified system. The destination system-name can also be a list of names such as
system-name!system-name!... !system-name!user
in which case, an attempt is made to send the file via the specified route to the destination. Care should be taken to
ensure that intermediate nodes in the route are willing to forward information.
source-file A pathname of a file on the local system to be copied to destination.
See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of uuto and uupick:

The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred.

In order to send files that begin with a dot (for instance, .profile), the files must be qualified with a dot. For exam<hy>
ple, the following files are correct:
