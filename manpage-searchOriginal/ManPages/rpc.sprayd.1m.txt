rpc.sprayd is a server that records the packets sent by spray(1M). The rpc.sprayd daemon may be started by in<hy>
etd(1M) or listen(1M).
The service provided by rpc.sprayd is not useful as a networking benchmark as it uses unreliable connectionless
transports, (udp for example). It can report a large number of packets dropped when the drops were caused by the
program sending packets faster than they can be buffered locally (before the packets get to the network medium).
