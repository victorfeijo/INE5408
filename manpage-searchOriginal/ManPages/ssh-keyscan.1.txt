ssh-keyscan <-> gather public ssh host keys of a number of hosts

 [-f file] [-] [host... | addrlist namelist] [...]
ssh-keyscan is a utility for gathering the public ssh host keys of a number of hosts. It was designed to aid in building
and verifying ssh_known_hosts files. ssh-keyscan provides a minimal interface suitable for use by shell and perl
scripts. The output of ssh-keyscan is directed to standard output.
ssh-keyscan uses non-blocking socket I/O to contact as many hosts as possible in parallel, so it is very efficient. The
keys from a domain of 1,000 hosts can be collected in tens of seconds, even when some of those hosts are down or
do not run ssh. For scanning, one does not need login access to the machines that are being scanned, nor does the
scanning process involve any encryption.
Input format:
 1.2.3.4,1.2.4.4
 name.my.domain,name,n.my.domain,n,1.2.3.4,1.2.4.4
Output format for rsa1 keys:
 host-or-namelist bits exponent modulus
Output format for rsa and dsa keys, where keytype is either ssh-rsa or `ssh-dsa:
 host-or-namelist keytype base64-encoded-key
The following options are supported:
-f filename Read hosts or addrlist namelist pairs from this file, one per line. If you specity - instead of a filename,
ssh-keyscan reads hosts or addrlist namelist pairs from the standard input.
-p port Port to connect to on the remote host.
-T timeout Set the timeout for connection attempts. If timeout seconds have elapsed since a connection was initiated
to a host or since the last time anything was read from that host, the connection is closed and the host in question is
considered unavailable. The default is for timeout is 5 seconds.
-t type Specify the type of the key to fetch from the scanned hosts. The possible values for type are rsa1 for protocol
version 1 and rsa or dsa for protocol version 2. Specify multiple values by separating them with commas. The de<hy>
fault is rsa1.
-v Specify verbose mode. Print debugging messages about progress.
-4 Force to use IPv4 addresses only.
-6 Forces to use IPv6 addresses only.
If a ssh_known_hosts file is constructed using ssh-keyscan without verifying the keys, users are vulnerable to man-
in-the-middle attacks. If the security model allows such a risk, ssh-keyscan can help in the detection of tampered
keyfiles or man-in-the-middle attacks which have begun after the ssh_known_hosts file was created. Example 1
Printing the rsa1 Host Key
<beginning of page>
The following example prints the rsa1 host key for machine hostname:
 $ ssh-keyscan hostname
Example 2 Finding All Hosts
The following commands finds all hosts from the file ssh_hosts which have new or different keys from those in the
sorted file ssh_known_hosts:
 $ ssh-keyscan -t rsa,dsa -f ssh_hosts | \
  sort -u - ssh_known_hosts | diff ssh_known_hosts -
/etc/ssh_known_hosts
The following exit values are returned:
0 No usage errors. ssh-keyscan might or might not have succeeded or failed to scan one, more or all of the given
hosts.
1 Usage error.

David Mazieres wrote the initial version, and Wayne Davison added suppport for protocol version 2.
ssh<em>keyscan generates
 Connection closed by remote host
messages on the consoles of all machines it scans if the server is older than version 2.9. This is because ssh-keyscan
opens a connection to the ssh port, reads the public key, and drops the connection as soon as it gets the key.
