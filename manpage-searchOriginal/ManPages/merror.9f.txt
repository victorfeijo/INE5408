merror <-> Send an M_ERROR message upstream

void merror(queue_t *wq, mblk_t *mp, int error);
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
wq Write queue associated with the read queue to send the M_ERROR on.
mp Optionally, a STREAMS message to convert to an M_ERROR.
error Error code to include in the M_ERROR message.
The merror() function constructs an M_ERROR message, and sends the resulting message upstream.
If mp is NULL, merror() allocates a one-byte M_ERROR message. If mp is non-NULL, merror() attempts to con<hy>
vert the passed-in message to an M_ERROR. However, if the passed-in message has more than one reference (see
dupmsg(9F)), or if it is of zero length, it is freed and a new message is allocated.
If the allocation or conversion fails, merror() silently fails. Otherwise, the resulting one-byte data block is assigned
the specified error code and sent upstream.
None.
This function can be called from user, kernel or interrupt context.
Callers must not hold any locks across an merror() that can be acquired as part of put(9E) processing.
