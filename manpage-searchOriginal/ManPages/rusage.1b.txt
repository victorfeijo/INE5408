rusage <-> print resource usage for a command
/usr/ucb/rusage command
The rusage command is similar to time(1). It runs the given command, which must be specified; that is, command is
not optional as it is in the C shell's timing facility. When the command is complete, rusage displays the real (wall
clock), the system CPU, and the user CPU times which elapsed during execution of the command, plus other fields
in the rusage structure, all on one long line. Times are reported in seconds and hundredths of a second. Example 1
