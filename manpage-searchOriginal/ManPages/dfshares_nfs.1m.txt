dfshares_nfs <-> list available NFS resources from remote systems
dfshares [-F nfs] [-h] [server]...
dfshares provides information about resources available to the host through NFS. The -F flag may be omitted if
NFS is the first file system type listed in the file /etc/dfs/fstypes.
The query may be restricted to the output of resources available from one or more servers.
dfshares without arguments displays all resources shared on the local system, regardless of file system type.
Specifying server displays information about the resources shared by each server. Server can be any system on the
network. If no server is specified, then server is assumed to be the local system.
The output of dfshares consists of an optional header line (suppressed with the -h flag) followed by a list of lines
containing whitespace-separated fields. For each resource, the fields are:
 resource server access transport
where
resource Specifies the resource name that must be given to the mount(1M) command.
server Specifies the system that is making the resource available.
access Specifies the access permissions granted to the client systems; however, dfshares cannot determine this in<hy>
formation for an NFS resource and populates the field with a hyphen (-).
transport Specifies the transport provider over which the resource is shared; however, dfshares cannot determine
this information for an NFS resource and populates the field with a hyphen (-).
A field may be null. Each null field is indicated by a hyphen (-) unless the remainder of the fields on the line are al<hy>
so null; in which case, the hyphen may be omitted.
-F nfs Specify the NFS file system type
-h Suppress header line in output.
