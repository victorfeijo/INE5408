tcsetpgrp <-> set foreground process group ID
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int tcsetpgrp(int fildes, pid_t pgid_id);
If the process has a controlling terminal, tcsetpgrp() will set the foreground process group ID associated with the
terminal to pgid_id. The file associated with fildes must be the controlling terminal of the calling process and the
controlling terminal must be currently associated with the session of the calling process. The value of pgid_id must
match a process group ID of a process in the same session as the calling process.
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. Otherwise, <mi>1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
The tcsetpgrp() function will fail if:
EBADF The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor.
EINVAL This implementation does not support the value in the pgid_id argument.
ENOTTY The calling process does not have a controlling terminal, or the file is not the controlling terminal, or the
controlling terminal is no longer associated with the session of the calling process.
EIO The process is not ignoring or holding SIGTTOU and is a member of an orphaned process group.
EPERM The value of pgid_id does not match the process group ID of a process in the same session as the calling
process.
