shm_unlink <-> remove a shared memory object
#include <sys/mman.h>
int shm_unlink(const char *name);
The shm_unlink() function removes the name of the shared memory object named by the string pointed to by name.
If one or more references to the shared memory object exists when the object is unlinked, the name is removed be<hy>
fore shm_unlink() returns, but the removal of the memory object contents will be postponed until all open and
mapped references to the shared memory object have been removed.
Upon successful completion, shm_unlink() returns 0. Otherwise it returns <mi>1 and sets errno to indicate the error
condition, and the named shared memory object is not affected by this function call.
The shm_unlink() function will fail if:
EACCES Permission is denied to unlink the named shared memory object.
ENAMETOOLONG The length of the name string exceeds PATH_MAX, or a pathname component is longer
than NAME_MAX while _POSIX_NO_TRUNC is in effect.
ENOENT The named shared memory object does not exist.
ENOSYS The shm_unlink() function is not supported by the system.

Solaris 2.6 was the first release to support the Asynchronous Input and Output option. Prior to this release, this func<hy>
tion always returned <mi>1 and set errno to ENOSYS.
