smbd <-> CIFS server daemon
/usr/lib/smbsrv/smbd
The smbd daemon handles CIFS/SMB requests from CIFS clients, such as Windows clients. Only processes with
{PRIV_SYS_SMB} and sufficient privileges to write the /var/run directory can run this daemon.
The smbd daemon is automatically invoked by using the sharemgr command over all available transports. By de<hy>
fault, smbd starts over the NetBIOS-Over-TCP (NBT) and TCP transports.
When smbd is started over NBT, the following services are started: <bu> The NetBIOS name service is started on UDP
port 137. <bu> The NetBIOS datagram service is started on UDP port 138. <bu> The NetBIOS session service is started on
TCP port 139.
When the smbd daemon is started over TCP, the CIFS service is started on TCP port 445.
Only one instance of smbd may be running at a time.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Daemon exited cleanly.
95 Daemon exited with a fatal error.
96 Daemon exited with a configuration error.

Use the svcadm command to perform administrative actions on the smbd service, such as enabling, disabling, or
restarting the service. Use the svcs command to query the service status.
The smbd service is managed by the service management facility under the service identifier svc:/net<hy>
work/smb/server.
If the smbd service is disabled, it will be enabled by the sharemgr(1M) command, unless its auto_enable property
is set to false.
