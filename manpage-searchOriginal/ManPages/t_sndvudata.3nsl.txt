t_sndvudata <-> send a data unit from one or more noncontiguous buffers
#include <xti.h>
int t_sndvudata(int fd, struct t_unitdata *unitdata, struct t_iovec *iov,
 unsigned int iovcount);
This function is used in connectionless mode to send a data unit to another transport user. The argument fd identi<hy>
fies the local transport endpoint through which data will be sent, iovcount contains the number of non-contiguous
udata buffers and is limited to an implementation-defined value given by T_IOV_MAX which is at least 16, and
unitdata points to a t_unitdata structure containing the following members:
 struct netbuf addr;
 struct netbuf opt;
 struct netbuf udata;
If the limit on iovcount is exceeded, the function fails with TBADDATA.
In unitdata, addr specifies the protocol address of the destination user, and opt identifies options that the user
wants associated with this request. The udata field is not used. The user may choose not to specify what protocol
options are associated with the transfer by setting the len field of opt to zero. In this case, the provider may use de<hy>
fault options.
The data to be sent is identified by iov[0] through iov [iovcount-1].
Note that the limit on the total number of bytes available in all buffers passed:
 iov(0).iov_len + . . + iov(iovcount-1).iov_len
may be constrained by implementation limits. If no other constraint applies, it will be limited by INT_MAX. In
practice, the availability of memory to an application is likely to impose a lower limit on the amount of data that can
be sent or received using scatter/gather functions.
By default, t_sndvudata() operates in synchronous mode and may wait if flow control restrictions prevent the data
from being accepted by the local transport provider at the time the call is made. However, if O_NONBLOCK is set
by means of t_open(3NSL) or fcntl(2), t_sndvudata() executes in asynchronous mode and will fail under such
conditions. The process can arrange to be notified of the clearance of a flow control restriction by means of either
t_look(3NSL) or the EM interface.
If the amount of data specified in iov0 through iov [iovcount-1] exceeds the TSDU size as returned in the tsdu field
of the info argument of t_open(3NSL) or t_getinfo(3NSL), or is zero and sending of zero octets is not supported
by the underlying transport service, a TBADDATA error is generated. If t_sndvudata() is called before the desti<hy>
nation user has activated its transport endpoint (see t_bind(3NSL)), the data unit may be discarded.
If it is not possible for the transport provider to immediately detect the conditions that cause the errors TBADDAD<hy>
DR and TBADOPT, these errors will alternatively be returned by t_rcvuderr(3NSL). An application must there<hy>
fore be prepared to receive these errors in both of these ways.
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned. Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and t_errno is set to in<hy>
dicate an error.
T_IDLE.
On failure, t_errno is set to one of the following:
TBADADDR The specified protocol address was in an incorrect format or contained illegal information.
TBADDATA Illegal amount of data. <bu> A single send was attempted specifying a TSDU greater than that specified in
the info argument, or a send of a zero byte TSDU is not supported by the provider. <bu> iovcount is greater than
T_IOV_MAX.

TBADF The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.
TBADOPT The specified options were in an incorrect format or contained illegal information.
TFLOW O_NONBLOCK i was set, but the flow control mechanism prevented the transport provider from accept<hy>
ing any data at this time.
TLOOK An asynchronous event has occurred on this transport endpoint.
TNOTSUPPORT This function is not supported by the underlying transport provider.
TOUTSTATE The communications endpoint referenced by fd is not in one of the states in which a call to this func<hy>
tion is valid.
TPROTO This error indicates that a communication problem has been detected between XTI and the transport
provider for which there is no other suitable XTI error (t_errno).
TSYSERR A system error has occurred during execution of this function.
In the TLI interface definition, no counterpart of this routine was defined.
