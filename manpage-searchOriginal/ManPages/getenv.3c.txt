getenv <-> return value for environment name
#include <stdlib.h>
char *getenv(const char *name);
The getenv() function searches the environment list (see environ(5)) for a string of the form name=value and, if the
string is present, returns a pointer to the value in the current environment.
If successful, getenv() returns a pointer to the value in the current environment; otherwise, it returns a null pointer.
The getenv() function can be safely called from a multithreaded application. Care must be exercised when using
both getenv() and putenv(3C) in a multithreaded application. These functions examine and modify the environ<hy>
ment list, which is shared by all threads in an application. The system prevents the list from being accessed simul<hy>
taneously by two different threads. It does not, however, prevent two threads from successively accessing the envi<hy>
ronment list using getenv() or putenv(3C).
