dsbitmap <-> size Availability Suite bitmap volumes
dsbitmap -h
dsbitmap -p data_volume [bitmap_volume]
dsbitmap -r data_volume [bitmap_volume]
The dsbitmap command calculates the size of the Availability Suite bitmap volume required for use with the speci<hy>
fied data volume.
The following options are supported:
-h
Prints the usage message for the dsbitmap command
-p data_volume [bitmap_volume]
For the given data_volume, dsbitmap calculates and display the required size for the associated Availability Suite
Point in Time bitmap volume. The bitmap volume sizes for all possible Availability Suite Point in Time set configu<hy>
rations are displayed. These configurations include Independent shadow, Full size dependent shadow, and Compact
dependent shadow. If the optional bitmap_volume argument is supplied, dsbitmap determines if this volume is large
enough to be used as the bitmap volume for data_volume.
-r data_volume [bitmap_volume]
For the given data_volume, dsbitmap calculates and displays the required size for the associated Availability Suite
Remote Mirror bitmap volume. The bitmap volume sizes for all possible Availability Suite Remote Mirror set con<hy>
figurations are displayed. These configurations include Sync replication, Async replication with memory queue,
disk queue and 32 bit refcount. If the optional bitmap_volume argument is supplied, dsbitmap determines if this
volume is large enough to be used as the bitmap volume for data_volume.
dsbitmap is typically used by the system administrator during the initial stages of configuring Sun StorageTek
Availability Suite software in order to determine the required bitmap volume sizes, and then to check if the bitmap
volumes that have been created are suitable.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion. If the name of a bitmap volume was specified, that volume is sufficiently large for all po<hy>
tential uses.
1 An error occurred.
2 An invalid option was supplied on the command line.
3 The specified bitmap volume is not large enough to be used as an Availability Suite Remote Mirror bitmap for an
asynchronous set with a disk queue, but is large enough to be used for all other Remote Mirror set configurations.
4 The specified bitmap volume is not large enough to be used as an Availability Suite Remote Mirror bitmap for any
Remote Mirror set configuration.
5 The specified bitmap volume is not large enough to be used as an Availability Suite Remote Mirror bitmap for any
Remote Mirror set configuration.
6 The specified bitmap volume is not large enough to be used as an Availability Suite Point in Time bitmap for a
compact dependent shadow, but is large enough to be used for all other Point in Time set configurations.
