OM_uint32 gss_test_oid_set_member(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
 const gss_OID member,const gss_OID_set set,
 int *present);
The gss_test_oid_set_member() function interrogates an object identifier set to determine if a specified object iden<hy>
tifier is a member. This function should be used with OID sets returned by gss_indicate_mechs(3GSS), gss_ac<hy>
quire_cred(3GSS), and gss_inquire_cred(3GSS), but it will also work with user-generated sets.
The parameter descriptions for gss_test_oid_set_member() follow:
minor_status A mechanism-specific status code
member An object identifier whose presence is to be tested
set An object identifier set.
present The value of present is non-zero if the specified OID is a member of the set; if not, the value of present is
zero.
The gss_test_oid_set_member() function may return the following status codes:
GSS_S_COMPLETE Successful completion
GSS_S_FAILURE The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific GSS status code is defined.
The mechanism-specific status code reported by means of the minor_status parameter details the error condition.
