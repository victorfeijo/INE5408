cc [ flag... ] file... -lMPAPI [ library... ]
#include <mpapi.h>
MP_STATUS MP_GetMPLuOidListFromTPG(MP_OID oid,
 MP_OID_LIST **ppList);
oid The object ID of the target port group.
ppList A pointer to a pointer to an object ID that has type MP_OID_LIST structure. With a successful return, this
contains a pointer to an object ID that has type MP_OID_LIST that contains the object IDs of all the (multipath)
logical units associated with the specified target port group.
The MP_GetMPLuOidListFromTPG() function returns the list of object IDs for the multipath logical units associ<hy>
ated with the specific target port group.
When the caller is finished using the list, it must free the memory used by the list by calling MP_FreeOidList.
MP_STATUS_INVALID_OBJECT_TYPE
The oid does not specify any valid object type. This is most likely to happen if an uninitialized object ID is passed to
the API.
MP_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER
The pplist is null or specifies a memory area to which data cannot be written, or when the oid has a type subfield
other than MP_OBJECT_TYPE_TARGET_PORT.
MP_STATUS_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND
The oid owner ID or object sequence number is invalid.
MP_STATUS_SUCCESS
The operation is successful.
MP_STATUS_FAILED
The multipath logical unit list for the specified target port group object ID is not found.
MP_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY
A memory allocation failure occurred.
