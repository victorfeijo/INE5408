minor_t ddi_getiminor(dev_t dev);
This interface is obsolete. getminor(9F) should be used instead.
The following parameters are supported:
dev Device number.
ddi_getiminor() extracts the minor number from a device number. This call should be used only for device numbers
that have been passed to the kernel from the user space through opaque interfaces such as the contents of ioctl(9E)
and putmsg(2). The device numbers passed in using standard device entry points must continue to be interpreted us<hy>
ing the getminor(9F) interface. This new interface is used to translate between user visible device numbers and in
kernel device numbers. The two numbers may differ in a clustered system.
For certain bus types, you can call this DDI function from a high-interrupt context. These types include ISA and
SBus buses. See sysbus(4), isa(4), and sbus(4) for details.
ddi_getiminor() can be called from user context only.
The minor number or EMINOR_UNKNOWN if the minor number of the device is invalid.

Writing Device Drivers
Drivers are required to replace calls to ddi_getminor.9f by getminor(9F)) in order to compile under Solaris 10 and
later versions.
