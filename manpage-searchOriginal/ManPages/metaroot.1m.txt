metaroot <-> setup system files for root (/) metadevice
/usr/sbin/metaroot -h
/usr/sbin/metaroot [-n] [-k system-name] [-v vfstab-name]
 [-c mddb.cf-name] [-m md.conf-name] [-R root-path] device
The metaroot command edits the /etc/vfstab and /etc/system files so that the system may be booted with the root
file system (/) on an appropriate metadevice. The only metadevices that support the root file system are a stripe with
only a single slice or a mirror on a single-slice stripe.
If necessary, the metaroot command can reset a system that has been configured to boot the root file system (/) on a
metadevice so that it uses a physical slice.
Root privileges are required for all of the following options except -h.
The following options are supported:
-c mddb.cf-name Use mddb.cf-name instead of the default /etc/lvm/mddb.cf file as a source of metadevice database
locations.
-h Display a usage message.
-k system-name Edit a user-supplied system-name instead of the default /etc/system system configuration informa<hy>
tion file.
-m md.conf-name Edit the configuration file specified by md.conf-name rather than the default, /ker<hy>
nel/drv/md.conf.
-n Print what would be done without actually doing it.
-R root-path When metaroot modifies system files, it accesses them in their relative location under root-path.
The -R option cannot be used in combination with the -c, -k,-m, or -v options. Note -
The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced with the -R option. Doing so might damage the
global zone's file system, might compromise the security of the global zone, and might damage the non-global
zone's file system. See zones(5).
-v vfstab-name Edit vfstab-name instead of the default /etc/vfstab table of file system defaults.
The following operands are supported:
device Specifies either the metadevice or the conventional disk device (slice) used for the root file system (/).
Example 1 Specifying Root File System on Metadevice
The following command edits /etc/system and /etc/vfstab to specify that the root file system is now on metadevice
d0.
 # metaroot d0
The following example shows the same command using a desriptive name for the metadevice.
 # metaroot newrootfilesystem

Example 2 Specifying Root File System on SCSI Disk
The following command edits /etc/system and /etc/vfstab to specify that the root file system is now on the SCSI
disk device /dev/dsk/c0t3d0s0.
 # metaroot /dev/dsk/c0t3d0s0
/etc/system System configuration information file. See system(4).
/etc/vfstab File system defaults.
/etc/lvm/mddb.cf Metadevice state database locations.
/kernel/drv/md.conf Configuration file for the metadevice driver, md.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred.
