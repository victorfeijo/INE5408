int ddi_dma_nextseg(ddi_dma_win_t win, ddi_dma_seg_t seg,
 ddi_dma_seg_t *nseg);
This interface is obsolete. ddi_dma_nextcookie(9F) should be used instead.
win A DMA window.
seg The current DMA segment or NULL.
nseg A pointer to the next DMA segment to be filled in. If seg is NULL, a pointer to the first segment within the
specified window is returned.
The ddi_dma_nextseg() function gets the next DMA segment within the specified window win. If the current seg<hy>
ment is NULL, the first DMA segment within the window is returned.
A DMA segment is always required for a DMA window. A DMA segment is a contiguous portion of a DMA win<hy>
dow (see ddi_dma_nextwin(9F)) which is entirely addressable by the device for a data transfer operation.
An example where multiple DMA segments are allocated is where the system does not contain DVMA capabilities
and the object may be non-contiguous. In this example the object will be broken into smaller contiguous DMA seg<hy>
ments. Another example is where the device has an upper limit on its transfer size (for example an 8-bit address reg<hy>
ister) and has expressed this in the DMA limit structure (see ddi_dma_lim_sparc(9S) or ddi_dma_lim_x86(9S)).
In this example the object will be broken into smaller addressable DMA segments.
The ddi_dma_nextseg() function returns:
DDI_SUCCESS Successfully filled in the next segment pointer.
DDI_DMA_DONE There is no next segment. The current segment is the final segment within the specified window.
DDI_DMA_STALE win does not refer to the currently active window.
The ddi_dma_nextseg() function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context.
For an example, see ddi_dma_segtocookie(9F).
