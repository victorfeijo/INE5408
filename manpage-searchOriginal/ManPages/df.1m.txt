The df utility displays the amount of disk space occupied by mounted or unmounted file systems, the amount of
used and available space, and how much of the file system's total capacity has been used. The file system is specified
by device, or by referring to a file or directory on the specified file system.
Used without operands or options, df reports on all mounted file systems.
df may not be supported for all FSTypes.
If df is run on a networked mount point that the automounter has not yet mounted, the file system size will be report<hy>
ed as zero. As soon as the automounter mounts the file system, the sizes will be reported correctly.
The following options are supported for both /usr/bin/df and /usr/xpg4/bin/df:
-a
Reports on all file systems including ones whose entries in /etc/mnttab (see mnttab(4)) have the ignore option set.
-b
Prints the total number of kilobytes free.
-e
Prints only the number of files free.
-F FSType
Specifies the FSType on which to operate. The -F option is intended for use with unmounted file systems. The
FSType should be specified here or be determinable from /etc/vfstab (see vfstab(4)) by matching the directory,
block_device, or resource with an entry in the table, or by consulting /etc/default/fs. See default_fs(4).
-g
Prints the entire statvfs(2) structure. This option is used only for mounted file systems. It can not be used with the -o
option. This option overrides the -b, -e, -k, -n, -P, and -t options.
-h
Like -k, except that sizes are in a more human readable format. The output consists of one line of information for
each specified file system. This information includes the file system name, the total space allocated in the file sys<hy>
tem, the amount of space allocated to existing files, the total amount of space available for the creation of new files
by unprivileged users, and the percentage of normally available space that is currently allocated to all files on the file
system. All sizes are scaled to a human readable format, for example, 14K, 234M, 2.7G, or 3.0T. Scaling is done by
repetitively dividing by 1024.
This option overrides the -b, -e, -g, -k, -n, -t, and -V options. This option only works on mounted filesystems and
can not be used together with -o option.
-k
Prints the allocation in kbytes. The output consists of one line of information for each specified file system. This in<hy>
formation includes the file system name, the total space allocated in the file system, the amount of space allocated to
existing files, the total amount of space available for the creation of new files by unprivileged users, and the percent<hy>
<beginning of page>
age of normally available space that is currently allocated to all files on the file system. This option overrides the -b,
-e, -n, and -t options.
-l
Reports on local file systems only. This option is used only for mounted file systems. It can not be used with the -o
option.
-n
Prints only the FSType name. Invoked with no operands, this option prints a list of mounted file system types. This
option is used only for mounted file systems. It can not be used with the -o option.
-o FSType-specific_options
Specifies FSType-specific options. These options are comma-separated, with no intervening spaces. See the manual
page for the FSType-specific command for details.
-t
Prints full listings with totals. This option overrides the -b, -e, and -n options.
-V
Echoes the complete set of file system specific command lines, but does not execute them. The command line is gen<hy>
erated by using the options and operands provided by the user and adding to them information derived from
/etc/mnttab, /etc/vfstab, or /etc/default/fs. This option may be used to verify and validate the command line.
-Z
Displays mounts in all visible zones. By default, df only displays mounts located within the current zone. This op<hy>
tion has no effect in a non-global zone.
The following option is supported for /usr/bin/df only:
-v
Like -k, except that sizes are displayed in multiples of the smallest block size supported by each specified file sys<hy>
tem.
The output consists of one line of information for each file system. This one line of information includes the follow<hy>
ing: <bu> the file system's mount point <bu> the file system's name <bu> the total number of blocks allocated to the file system <bu>
the number of blocks allocated to existing files <bu> the number of blocks available for the creation of new files by un<hy>
privileged users <bu> the percentage of blocks in use by files
The following option is supported for /usr/xpg4/bin/df only:
-P
Same as -h except in 512-byte units.
The df utility interprets operands according to the following precedence: block_device, directory, file. The following
operands are supported:
block_device
Represents a block special device (for example, /dev/dsk/c1d0s7).
<beginning of page>
directory
Represents a valid directory name. df reports on the file system that contains directory.
file
Represents a valid file name. df reports on the file system that contains file.
resource
Represents an NFS resource name.
See largefile(5) for the description of the behavior of df when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte (
2^31 bytes). Example 1 Executing the df command
The following example shows the df command and its output:
 example% /usr/bin/df
 / (/dev/dsk/c0t0d0s0 ): 287530 blocks 92028 files
 /system/contract (ctfs ): 0 blocks 2147483572 files
 /system/object (objfs ): 0 blocks 2147483511 files
 /usr (/dev/dsk/c0t0d0s6 ): 1020214 blocks 268550 files
 /proc (/proc ): 0 blocks 878 files
 /dev/fd (fd ): 0 blocks 0 files
 /etc/mnttab (mnttab ): 0 blocks 0 files
 /var/run (swap ): 396016 blocks 9375 files
 /tmp (swap ): 396016 blocks 9375 files
 /opt (/dev/dsk/c0t0d0s5 ): 381552 blocks 96649 files
 /export/home (/dev/dsk/c0t0d0s7 ): 434364 blocks 108220 files
where the columns represent the mount point, device (or "filesystem", according to df -k), free blocks, and free files,
respectively. For contract file systems, /system/contract is the mount point, ctfs is the contract file system (used by
SMF) with 0 free blocks and 2147483582(INTMAX-1) free files. For object file systems, /system/object is the
mount point, objfs is the object file system (see objfs(7FS)) with 0 free blocks and 2147483511 free files. Example
2 Writing Portable Information About the /usr File System
The following example writes portable information about the /usr file system:
 example% /usr/xpg4/bin/df -P /usr
Example 3 Writing Portable Information About the /usr/src file System
Assuming that /usr/src is part of the /usr file system, the following example writes portable information :
 example% /usr/xpg4/bin/df -P /usr/src
Example 4 Using df to Display Inode Usage
The following example displays inode usage on all ufs file systems:
 example%/usr/bin/df -F ufs -o i

SYSV3
This variable is used to override the default behavior of df and provide compatibility with INTERACTIVE UNIX
System and SCO UNIX installation scripts. As the SYSV3 variable is provided for compatibility purposes only, it
should not be used in new scripts.
When set, any header which normally displays "files" will now display "nodes". See environ(5) for descriptions of
the following environment variables that affect the execution of df: LANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LC_MES<hy>
SAGES, and NLSPATH.
The following exit values are returned:
0
Successful completion.
>0
An error occurred.
/dev/dsk/*
Disk devices
/etc/default/fs
Default local file system type. Default values can be set for the following flags in /etc/default/fs. For example: LO<hy>
CAL=ufs, where LOCAL is the default partition for a command if no FSType is specified.
/etc/mnttab
Mount table

If UFS logging is enabled on a file system, the disk space used for the log is reflected in the df report. The log is al<hy>
located from free blocks on the file system, and it is sized approximately 1 Mbyte per 1 Gbyte of file system, up to
256 Mbytes. The log size may be larger (up to a maximum of 512 Mbytes) depending on the number of cylinder
groups present in the file system.
