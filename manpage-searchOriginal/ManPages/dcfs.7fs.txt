The dcfs filesystem is a layered filesystem that you use to compress data when writing to a file and decompress upon
read. The primary function of the dcfs filesystem is to compress individual files when constructing a boot archive
and when reading or booting from the archive.

The dcfs compression/decompression file system works only with UFS.
