filename Is a pointer to the file in which screen contents are written.
These function perform input/output functions on a screen basis.
The scr_dump() function writes the contents of the virtual screen, curscr, to filename.
The scr_restore() function reads the contents of filename from curscr (which must have been written with
scr_dump()). The next refresh operation restores the screen to the way it looks in filename.
The scr_init() function reads the contents of filename and uses those contents to initialize the X/Open Curses data
structures to what is actually on screen. The next refresh operation bases its updates on this data, unless the terminal
has been written to since filename was saved or the terminfo capabilities rmcup and nrrmc are defined for the cur<hy>
rent terminal.
The scr_set() function combines scr_restore() and scr_init(). It informs the program that the contents of the file
filename are what is currently on the screen and that the program wants those contents on the screen.
On success, these functions return OK. Otherwise, they return ERR.
None.
