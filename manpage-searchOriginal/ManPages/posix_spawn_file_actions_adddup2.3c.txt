posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2 <-> add dup2 action to spawn file actions object
#include <spawn.h>
int posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2(
 posix_spawn_file_actions_t *file_actions, int fildes,
 int newfildes);
The posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2() function adds a dup2(3C) action to the object referenced by file_actions
that causes the file descriptor fildes to be duplicated as newfildes (as if dup2(fildes, newfildes) had been called) when
a new process is spawned using this file actions object.
A spawn file actions object is as defined in posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose(3C).
Upon successful completion, the posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2() function returns 0. Otherwise, an error
number is be returned to indicate the error.
The posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2() function will fail if:
EBADF The value specified by fildes or newfildes is negative or greater than or equal to {OPEN_MAX}.
ENOMEM Insufficient memory exists to add to the spawn file actions object.
The posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2() function may fail if:
EINVAL The value specified by file_actions is invalid.
It is not considered an error for the fildes argument passed to posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2() to specify a file
descriptor for which the specified operation could not be performed at the time of the call. Any such error will be de<hy>
tected when the associated file actions object is later used during a posix_spawn(3C) or posix_spawnp(3C) opera<hy>
tion.
