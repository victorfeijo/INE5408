panels <-> character based panels package
#include <panel.h>
The panel library is built using the curses library, and any program using panels routines must call one of the curs<hy>
es initialization routines such as initscr. A program using these routines must be compiled with -lpanel and -lcurses
on the cc command line.
The panels package gives the applications programmer a way to have depth relationships between curses windows;
a curses window is associated with every panel. The panels routines allow curses windows to overlap without mak<hy>
ing visible the overlapped portions of underlying windows. The initial curses window, stdscr, lies beneath all pan<hy>
els. The set of currently visible panels is the deck of panels.
The panels package allows the applications programmer to create panels, fetch and set their associated windows,
shuffle panels in the deck, and manipulate panels in other ways.
The following table lists each panels routine and the name of the manual page on which it is described.

Each panels routine that returns a pointer to an object returns NULL if an error occurs. Each panel routine that re<hy>
turns an integer, returns OK if it executes successfully and ERR if it does not.
