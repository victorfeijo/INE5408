rolemod <-> modify a role's login information on the system
rolemod [-u uid [-o]] [-g group] [-G group [, group...]]
 [-d dir [-m]] [-s shell] [-c comment] [-l new_name]
 [-f inactive] [-e expire]
 [-A authorization [, authorization]]
 [-P profile [, profile]] [-K key=value] role
The rolemod utility modifies a role's login information on the system. It changes the definition of the specified login
and makes the appropriate login-related system file and file system changes.
The system file entries created with this command have a limit of 512 characters per line. Specifying long arguments
to several options may exceed this limit.
The following options are supported:
-A authorization
One or more comma separated authorizations as deined in auth_attr(4). Only role with grant rights to the autho<hy>
rization can assign it to an account. This replaces any existing authorization setting. If no authorization list is speci<hy>
fied, the existing setting is removed.
-c comment
Specify a comment string. comment can be any text string. It is generally a short description of the login, and is cur<hy>
rently used as the field for the user's full name. This information is stored in the user's /etc/passwd entry.
-d dir
Specify the new home directory of the role. It defaults to base_dir/login, where base_dir is the base directory for
new login home directories, and login is the new login.
-e expire
Specify the expiration date for a role. After this date, no role will be able to access this login. The expire option ar<hy>
gument is a date entered using one of the date formats included in the template file /etc/datemsk. See getdate(3C).
For example, you may enter 10/6/90 or October 6, 1990. A value of `` '' defeats the status of the expired date.
-f inactive
Specify the maximum number of days allowed between uses of a login ID before that login ID is declared invalid.
Normal values are positive integers. A value of 0 defeats the status.
-g group
Specify an existing group's integer ID or character-string name. It redefines the role's primary group membership.
-G group
Specify an existing group's integer ID or character string name. It redefines the role's supplementary group member<hy>
ship. Duplicates between group with the -g and -G options are ignored. No more than NGROUPS_UMAX groups
may be specified as defined in <param.h>.
-K key=value
Replace existing or add to a role's key=value pair attributes. Multiple -K options can be used to replace or add multi<hy>
ple key=value pairs. However, keys must not be repeated. The generic -K option with the appropriate key may be
used instead of the specific implied key options (-A and -P). See user_attr(4) for a list of valid key=value pairs.
The keyword type can be specified with the value role or the value normal. When using the value normal, the ac<hy>
count changes from a role user to a normal user; using the value role keeps the account a role user.

-l new_logname
Specify the new login name for the role. The new_logname argument is a string no more than eight bytes consisting
of characters from the set of alphabetic characters, numeric characters, period (.), underline (_), and hypen (<mi>). The
first character should be alphabetic and the field should contain at least one lower case alphabetic character. A warn<hy>
ing message will be written if these restrictions are not met. A future Solaris release may refuse to accept login fields
that do not meet these requirements. The new_logname argument must contain at least one character and must not
contain a colon (:) or NEWLINE (\n).
-m
Move the role's home directory to the new directory specified with the -d option. If the directory already exists, it
must have permissions read/write/execute by group, where group is the role's primary group.
-o
This option allows the specified UID to be duplicated (non-unique).
-P profile
One or more comma-separated execution profiles defined in auth_attr(4). This replaces any existing profile setting.
If no profile list is specified, the existing setting is removed.
-s shell
Specify the full pathname of the program that is used as the role's shell on login. The value of shell must be a valid
executable file.
-u uid
Specify a new UID for the role. It must be a non-negative decimal integer less than MAXUID as defined in
<param.h>. The UID associated with the role's home directory is not modified with this option; a role will not have
access to their home directory until the UID is manually reassigned using chown(1).
The following operands are supported:
login
An existing login name to be modified.
In case of an error, rolemod prints an error message and exits with one of the following values:
2
The command syntax was invalid. A usage message for the rolemod command is displayed.
3
An invalid argument was provided to an option.
4
The uid given with the -u option is already in use.
5
The password files contain an error. pwconv(1M) can be used to correct possible errors. See passwd(4).

6
The login to be modified does not exist, the group does not exist, or the login shell does not exist.
8
The login to be modified is in use.
9
The new_logname is already in use.
10
Cannot update the /etc/group or /etc/user_attr file. Other update requests will be implemented.
11
Insufficient space to move the home directory (-m option). Other update requests will be implemented.
12
Unable to complete the move of the home directory to the new home directory.
