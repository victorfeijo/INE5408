glob.h, glob <-> pathname pattern-matching types
#include <glob.h>
The <glob.h> header defines the structures and symbolic constants used by the glob(3C).
The structure type glob_t contains the following members:
 size_t gl_pathc /* count of paths matched by pattern */
 char **gl_pathv /* pointer to a list of matched
  pathnames */
 size_t gl_offs /* lots to reserve at the beginning
  of gl_pathv */
The following constants are provided as values for the flags argument:
GLOB_APPEND Append generated pathnames to those previously obtained.
GLOB_DOOFFS Specify how many null pointers to add to the beginning of gl_pathv.
GLOB_ERR Cause glob() to return on error.
GLOB_MARK Each pathname that is a directory that matches pattern has a slash appended.
GLOB_NOCHECK If pattern does not match any pathname, then return a list consisting of only pattern.
GLOB_NOESCAPE Disable backslash escaping.
GLOB_NOSORT Do not sort the pathnames returned.
The following constants are defined as error return values:
GLOB_ABORTED The scan was stopped because GLOB_ERR was set or (*errfunc)() returned non-zero.
GLOB_NOMATCH The pattern does not match any existing pathname, and GLOB_NOCHECK was not set in
flags.
GLOB_NOSPACE An attempt to allocate memory failed.
GLOB_NOSYS Reserved.
