timezone <-> default timezone data base
/etc/timezone
The timezone file contains information regarding the default timezone for each host in a domain. Alternatively, a sin<hy>
gle default line for the entire domain may be specified. Each entry has the format:
 Timezone-name official-host-or-domain-name
Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or TAB characters. A `#' indicates the beginning of a comment;
characters up to the end of the line are not interpreted by routines which search the file. The timezone is a pathname
relative to the directory /usr/share/lib/zoneinfo.
This file is not actually referenced by any system software; it is merely used as a source file to construct the NIS
timezone.byname map. This map is read by sysidtool(1M) to initialize the timezone of the client system at installa<hy>
tion time. For more information, see the Solaris Express Installation Guide: Basic Installations.
The timezone file does not set the timezone environment variable TZ. See TIMEZONE(4) for information to set
the TZ environment variable. Example 1 Typical timezone line
Here is a typical line from the /etc/timezone file:
