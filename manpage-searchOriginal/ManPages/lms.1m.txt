lms <-> allow applications to access the Intel Active Management Technology
lms
The Local Manageability Service, lms, allows applications to access the Intel Active Management Technology (Intel
AMT) ME (Management Engine) using the local HECI interface. LMS is dependent on the HECI driver.
To use lms, ensure that the Intel AMT Manageability Interface driver is installed and connected to the ME.
lms is intended to be run as a daemon. Messages from the service are sent to the syslog. LMS messages are marked
with a source of "LMS".
For an example of how to enable the LMS service using SMF, see EXAMPLES. Example 1 Enabling the LMS ser<hy>
