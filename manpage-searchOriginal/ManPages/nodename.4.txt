nodename <-> local source for system name
/etc/nodename
When a machine is standalone or its IP address is configured locally, the /etc/nodename file contains the system
name. By convention, the system name is the same as the hostname associated with the IP address of the primary
network interface, for example, hostname.hme0.
If the machine's network configuration is delivered by the RPC bootparams protocol, the /etc/nodename file is not
used, as the system name is delivered by the remote service.
Given a system name value, regardless of source, the uname utility invoked with the -S option is used to set the sys<hy>
tem name of the running system.
If the machine's network configuration is delivered by the DHCP protocol, the /etc/nodename file is used only if the
DHCP server does not provide a value for the Hostname option (DHCP standard option code 12).
A system name configured in /etc/nodename should be unique within the system's name service domain in order to
ensure that any network services provided by the system will operate correctly.
Given a system name value, regardless of source, the uname utility invoked with the -S option is used to set the sys<hy>
tem name of the running system. Example 1 Syntax
The syntax for nodename consists of a single line containing the system's name. For example, for a system named
myhost:
