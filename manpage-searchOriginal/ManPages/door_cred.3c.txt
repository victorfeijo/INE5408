#include <door.h>
int door_cred(door_cred_t *info);
The door_cred() function returns credential information associated with the client (if any) of the current door in<hy>
vocation.
The contents of the info argument include the following fields:
 uid_t dc_euid; /* Effective uid of client */
 gid_t dc_egid; /* Effective gid of client */
 uid_t dc_ruid; /* Real uid of client */
 gid_t dc_rgid; /* Real gid of client */
 pid_t dc_pid; /* pid of client */
The credential information associated with the client refers to the information from the immediate caller; not neces<hy>
sarily from the first thread in a chain of door calls.
Upon successful completion, door_cred() returns 0. Otherwise, door_cred() returns <mi>1 and sets errno to indicate
the error.
The door_cred() function will fail if:
EFAULT The address of the info argument is invalid.
EINVAL There is no associated door client.
The door_cred() function is obsolete. Applications should use the door_ucred(3C) function in place of
door_cred().
