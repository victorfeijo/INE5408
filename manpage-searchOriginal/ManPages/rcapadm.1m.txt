rcapadm <-> configure resource capping daemon
rcapadm
rcapadm [ [-n] -E | -D]
 [-i interval=value,...,interval=value] [-c percent]
 [-z zonename -m maxvalue]
The rcapadm command allows a user with the privileges described below to configure various attributes of the re<hy>
source capping daemon. If used without arguments, rcapadm displays the current status of the resource capping
daemon if it has been configured. See rcapd(1M) for more information.
In the current release of the Solaris operating environment, rcapadm is available to users with all privileges and to
users who have the Process Management profile in their list of profiles. The System Administrator role includes the
Process Management profile.
-c percent
Set the minimum physical memory utilization for memory cap enforcement. Caps will not be enforced until the
physical memory available to processes is low. The percent value should be in the range 0 to 100. The minimum
(and default) value is 0, which means that memory caps are always enforced.
-D
Disable the resource capping daemon so that it will not be started when the system is booted. Also stop the resource
capping daemon now, if the -n option is not specified and it is currently running.
-E
Enable the resource capping daemon so that it will be started each time the system is booted. Also start the resource
capping daemon now, if the -n option is not specified and it is not currently running.
-i interval=value,...,interval=value
Set intervals for various periodic operations performed by rcapd. All intervals are specified in seconds. You can set
the following intervals:
scan The interval at which rcapd scans for new processes. The default scan interval is every 15 seconds. The mini<hy>
mum value is 1 second.
sample The interval of process resident set size sampling. The default sample interval is every 5 seconds. The mini<hy>
mum value is 1 second.
report The interval at which various paging statistics are updated by rcapd, in seconds. These statistics can be
viewed by using rcapstat(1SRM). The default reporting interval is every 5 seconds. When the interval is set to 0,
statistics will not be updated. Note -
Paging refers to the act of relocating portions of memory, called pages, to or from physical memory. rcapd pages out
the most infrequently used pages.
config The reconfiguration interval, in seconds. At each reconfiguration event, rcapd checks its configuration file for
updates, and scans the project databases for new project caps. The default reconfiguration interval is every 60 sec<hy>
onds. The minimum interval is 0. When the interval is set to 0, no periodic reconfiguration occurs, although the run<hy>
ning daemon can still be reconfigured by sending it SIGHUP.
-m maxvalue
Used in conjunction with the -z option. Specifies a value for rcap.max-rss, a dynamically-set cap on the usage of
physical memory for the zone specified by -z. You can apply a scale (K, M, G, T) to the value you specify. K means
kilobyte; M, megabyte; G, gigabyte; and T, terabyte. For example, 100M is 100 megabytes.

-n
Do not affect the running state of the resource capping daemon when enabling or disabling it.
-z zonename
Used in conjunction with the -m option. Specifies the zone for which you are dynamically specifying a cap on physi<hy>
cal memory usage (using -m).
Note -
To set a persistent cap on memory usage within a zone, use zonecfg(1M). Example 1 Configuring the Resource
Capping Daemon with Immediate Enforcement
# rcapadm -E -i scan=15,sample=5,report=5,config=60 -c 0
Example 2 Specifying a Resource Cap for a Zone
The command shown below specifies the maximum amount of memory that can be consumed by a specified zone.
Note that this value lasts only until the next reboot. To set a persistent cap, use zonecfg(1M).
 # rcapadm -z testzone -m 512M
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion. The modifications to the current configuration were valid and made successfully.
1 An error occurred. A fatal error occurred either in obtaining or modifying the resource capping configuration.
2 Invalid command-line options were specified.
