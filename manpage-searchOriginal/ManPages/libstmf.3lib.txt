libstmf <-> SCSI Target Mode Framework library

#include <libstmf.h>
Functions in this library provide configuration management of the SCSI Target Mode Framework (STMF), allowing
clients to manage the provisioning of logical units and targets to the initiator clients of the framework.
Host Group
A Host Group is a set of one or more initiator ports that are combined together for the purposes of applying access
controls to a Logical Unit object and assigning a logical unit number to the Logical Unit. The assigned logical unit
number will be reported to the members of that Host Group via the SCSI REPORT LUN command. Host Groups
can contain initiator ports that are not visible to the SCSI Target Mode Framework. Initiator ports might not be a
member in more than one group. A Host Group is associated with a given Logical Unit via a view entry. Host Group
names are unique within the framework.
Logical Unit
A Logical Unit object is provided to the SCSI Target Mode Framework for the purposes of executing SCSI com<hy>
mands. Library clients can manage a Logical Unit object's accessibility to one or more SCSI initiator clients. lib<hy>
stmf library clients cannot add or remove Logical Unit objects from the system. Every Logical Unit object within
the SCSI Target Mode Framework is owned by a logical unit provider whose identity is available via the properties
on the Logical Unit object.
Logical Unit Number
A Logical Unit Number is the SCSI identifier of a logical unit within a target.
Target Port
A Target port object is provided to the SCSI Target Mode Framework for the purposes of receiving SCSI commands
on a particular logical unit. Library clients can manage a Logical Unit object's availability to one or more Target port
objects. Library clients cannot add or remove Target objects from the system. Every Target port object within the
SCSI Target Mode Framework is owned by a Local Port provider whose identity is available via the properties on
the Target port object.
Target Port Group
A Target Port Group is a set of one or more Target ports that are combined together for the purposes of applying
availability to a Logical Unit object. A Target Port Group may be applied to any given Logical Unit via a view entry.
Target ports may not be a member in more than one Target Port Group. Target Port Group names are unique within
the framework.
View
A View is a list of logical units exposed to a list of initiator ports through a list of targets.
View Entry
A View Entry object defines the association of an host group, a target group and a logical unit number with a speci<hy>
fied logical unit. When a view entry is created for a logical unit, a caller can assign all targets and/or all initiator
ports to the logical unit thus making the logical unit accessible to all target ports and/or all initiator ports. A logical
unit may have one or more view entries associated with it. Any two view entries are considered to be in conflict
when an attempt is made to duplicate the association of any given initiator port, target port and logical unit. Attempt<hy>
ing this will result in an error returned from the call to stmfAddViewEntry(3STMF).
The shared object libstmf.so.1 provides the public interfaces defined below. See Intro(3) for additional information
