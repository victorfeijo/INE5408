sndrd <-> Remote Mirror daemon
/usr/lib/sndrd [-c max_connections] [-l listen_backlog]
The sndrd daemon processes client Remote Mirror requests. Only the root user or a user with equivalent privileges
can run this daemon. The daemon is automatically invoked in run level 2. sndrd restarts the TCP transport layers.
Administrators wanting to change startup parameters for sndrd should, as root or equivalent, make changes in the
/etc/default/sndr file rather than editing the /lib/svc/method/svc-rdcsyncd file. See sndr(4).
The sndrd daemon supports the following options:
-c max_connections
Sets the maximum number of connections allowed to the server over connection-oriented transports. By default, the
number of connections is 16.
-l listen_backlog
Sets connection queue length for the RDC TCP over a connection-oriented transport. The default value is 10 entries.

/lib/svc/method/svc-rdcsyncd

/lib/svc/method/svc-rdc
