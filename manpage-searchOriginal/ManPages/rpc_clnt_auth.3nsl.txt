These routines are part of the RPC library that allows C language programs to make procedure calls on other ma<hy>
chines across the network, with desired authentication.
These routines are normally called after creating the CLIENT handle. The cl_auth field of the CLIENT structure
should be initialized by the AUTH structure returned by some of the following routines. The client's authentication
information is passed to the server when the RPC call is made.
Only the NULL and the SYS style of authentication is discussed here. For the DES style authentication, please refer
to secure_rpc(3NSL).
The NULL and SYS style of authentication are safe in multithreaded applications. For the MT-level of the DES
style, see its pages.
The following routines require that the header <rpc/rpc.h> be included (see rpc(3NSL) for the definition of the
AUTH data structure).
 #include <rpc/rpc.h>
auth_destroy() A function macro that destroys the authentication information associated with auth. Destruction usu<hy>
ally involves deallocation of private data structures. The use of auth is undefined after calling auth_destroy().
authnone_create() Create and return an RPC authentication handle that passes nonusable authentication informa<hy>
tion with each remote procedure call. This is the default authentication used by RPC.
authsys_create() Create and return an RPC authentication handle that contains AUTH_SYS authentication infor<hy>
mation. The parameter host is the name of the machine on which the information was created; uid is the user's user
ID; gid is the user's current group ID; len and aup_gids refer to a counted array of groups to which the user belongs.
authsys_create_default Call authsys_create() with the appropriate parameters.
