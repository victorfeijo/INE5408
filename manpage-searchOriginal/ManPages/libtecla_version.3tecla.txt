void libtecla_version(int *major, int *minor, int *micro);
The libtecla_version() function queries for the version number of the library.
On return, this function records the three components of the libtecla version number in *major, *minor, *micro. The
formal meaning of the three components is as follows:
major Incrementing this number implies that a change has been made to the library's public interface that makes it
binary incompatible with programs that were linked with previous shared versions of libtecla.
minor This number is incremented by one whenever additional functionality, such as new functions or modules, are
added to the library.
micro This number is incremented whenever modifications to the library are made that make no changes to the pub<hy>
lic interface, but which fix bugs and/or improve the behind-the-scenes implementation.
