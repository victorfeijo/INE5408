posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy, posix_spawn_file_actions_init <-> destroy and initialize spawn file actions object

int posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy(
 posix_spawn_file_actions_t *file_actions);
int posix_spawn_file_actions_init(
 posix_spawn_file_actions_t *file_actions);
The posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy() function destroys the object referenced by file_actions. The object be<hy>
comes, in effect, uninitialized. An implementation can cause posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy() to set the object
referenced by file_actions to an invalid value. A destroyed spawn file actions object can be reinitialized using
posix_spawn_file_actions_init(). The results of otherwise referencing the object after it has been destroyed are un<hy>
defined.
The posix_spawn_file_actions_init() function initializes the object referenced by file_actions to contain no file ac<hy>
tions for posix_spawn(3C) or posix_spawnp(3C) to perform.
A spawn file actions object is as defined in posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose(3C).
The effect of initializing an already initialized spawn file actions object is undefined.
Upon successful completion, these functions return 0. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
The posix_spawn_file_actions_init() function will fail if:
ENOMEM Insufficient memory exists to initialize the spawn file actions object.
The posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy() function will may if:
EINVAL The value specified by file_actions is invalid.
