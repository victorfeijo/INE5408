/etc/netmasks
The netmasks file contains network masks used to implement IP subnetting. It supports both standard subnetting as
specified in RFC-950 and variable length subnetting as specified in RFC-1519. When using standard subnetting
there should be a single line for each network that is subnetted in this file with the network number, any number of
SPACE or TAB characters, and the network mask to use on that network. Network numbers and masks may be
specified in the conventional IP `.' (dot) notation (like IP host addresses, but with zeroes for the host part). For ex<hy>
ample,

 128.32.0.0 255.255.255.0
can be used to specify that the Class B network 128.32.0.0 should have eight bits of subnet field and eight bits of
host field, in addition to the standard sixteen bits in the network field.
When using variable length subnetting, the format is identical. However, there should be a line for each subnet with
the first field being the subnet and the second field being the netmask that applies to that subnet. The users of the
database, such as ifconfig(1M), perform a lookup to find the longest possible matching mask. It is possible to com<hy>
bine the RFC-950 and RFC-1519 form of subnet masks in the netmasks file. For example,

 128.32.0.0 255.255.255.0
 128.32.27.0 255.255.255.240
 128.32.27.16 255.255.255.240
 128.32.27.32 255.255.255.240
 128.32.27.48 255.255.255.240
 128.32.27.64 255.255.255.240
 128.32.27.80 255.255.255.240
 128.32.27.96 255.255.255.240
 128.32.27.112 255.255.255.240
 128.32.27.128 255.255.255.240
 128.32.27.144 255.255.255.240
 128.32.27.160 255.255.255.240
 128.32.27.176 255.255.255.240
 128.32.27.192 255.255.255.240
 128.32.27.208 255.255.255.240
 128.32.27.224 255.255.255.240
 128.32.27.240 255.255.255.240
 128.32.64.0 255.255.255.192
can be used to specify different netmasks in different parts of the 128.32.0.0 Class B network number. Addresses
128.32.27.0 through 128.32.27.255 have a subnet mask with 28 bits in the combined network and subnet fields (of<hy>
ten referred to as the subnet field) and 4 bits in the host field. Furthermore, addresses 128.32.64.0 through
128.32.64.63 have a 26 bits in the subnet field. Finally, all other addresses in the range 128.32.0.0 through
128.32.255.255 have a 24 bit subnet field.
Invalid entries are ignored.
