lpset <-> set printing configuration in /etc/printers.conf or other supported databases
lpset [-n system | nisplus | fnsldap] [-x]
 [ [-D binddn] [-w passwd] [-h ldaphost]]
 [-a key=value] [-d key] destination
The lpset utility sets printing configuration information in the system configuration databases. Use lpset to create
and update printing configuration in /etc/printers.conf, or printers.org_dir (NIS+). See nsswitch.conf(4) and
printers.conf(4).
Only a superuser or a member of Group 14 may execute lpset.
The following options are supported:
-n system|nisplus|ldap Create or update the configuration information for the destination entry in /etc/print<hy>
ers.conf, printers.org_dir (NIS+), or LDAP printer contexts. system specifies that the information is created or up<hy>
dated in /etc/printers.conf. nisplus specifies that the information is created or updated in the printers.org_dir NIS+
table. ldap specifies that the information is written to an LDAP server. See .
If -n is not specified, system is the default.
-x Remove all configuration for the destination entry from the database specified by the -n option.
-a key=value Configure the specified key=value pair for the destination. See printers.conf(4) for information regard<hy>
ing the specification of key=value pairs.
-d key Delete the configuration option specified by key for the destination entry. See printers.conf(4) for informa<hy>
tion regarding the specification of key and key=value pairs.
-D binddn Use the distinguished name (DN) binddn to bind to the LDAP directory server.
-w passwd Use passwd as the password for authentication to the LDAP directory server.
-h ldaphost Specify an alternate host on which the LDAP server is running. This option is only used when ldap is
specified as the naming service. If this option is not specified, the default is the current host system.
The following operand is supported:
destination Specifies the entry in /etc/printers.conf, printers.org_dir, or LDAP, in which to create or modify infor<hy>
mation. destination names a printer of class of printers. See lpadmin(1M). Each entry in printers.conf describes
one destination. Specify destination using atomic names. POSIX-style destination names are not acceptable. See
printers.conf(4) for information regarding the naming conventions for atomic names and standards(5) for informa<hy>
tion regarding POSIX.
Example 1 Removing All Existing Printing Configuration Information
The following example removes all existing printing configuration information for destination dogs from /etc/print<hy>
ers.conf:
 example% lpset -x dogs
Example 2 Setting a key=value Pair
The following example sets the user-equivalence =true key=value pair for destination tabloid in the NIS+ context:
 example% lpset -n nisplus -a user-equivalence=true tabloid
<beginning of page>
Example 3 Setting a key=value Pair in LDAP
 example% lpset -n ldap -h ldapl.xyz.com -D "cn=Directory Manager" \
  -w passwd -a key1=value1 printer1
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
non-zero An error occurred.
/etc/printers.conf System configuration database.
printer.org_dir (NIS+) NIS+ version of /etc/printers.conf.

If the ldap database is used, the printer administrator should be mindful of the following when updating printer in<hy>
formation. 1. Because the domain information for the printer being updated is extracted from the ldapclient(1M)
configuration, the LDAP server being updated must host the same domain that is used by the current ldapclient(1M)
server. 2. If the LDAP server being updated is a replica LDAP server, the updates will be referred to the master
LDAP server and completed there. The updates might be out of sync and not appear immediatedly, as the replica
server may not have been updated by the master server. For example, a printer that you deleted by using lpset may
still appear in the printer list you display with lpget until the replica is updated from the master. Replica servers vary
as to how often they are updated from the master. See System Administration Guide: Solaris Printing for informa<hy>
tion on LDAP server replication. 3. Although users can use the LDAP command line utilities ldapadd(1) and ldap<hy>
modify(1) to update printer entries in the directory, the preferred method is to use lpset. Otherwise, if the ldapadd
and ldapmodify utilities are used, the administrator must ensure that the printer-name attribute value is unique
within the ou=printers container on the LDAP server. If the value is not unique, the result of modifications done us<hy>
ing lpset or the Solaris Print Manager, printmgr(1M) may be unpredictable.
