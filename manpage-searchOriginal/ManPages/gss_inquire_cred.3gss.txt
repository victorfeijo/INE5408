 gss_OID_set *mechanisms);
The parameter descriptions for gss_inquire_cred() follow:
minor_status Mechanism specific status code.
cred_handle Handle that refers to the target credential. Specify GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL to inquire about the
default initiator principal.
name Name of the identity asserted by the credential. Any storage associated with this name should be freed by the
application after use by a call to gss_release_name(3GSS).
lifetime Number of seconds for which the credential remains valid. If the credential has expired, this parameter will
be set to zero. Specify NULL if the parameter is not required.
cred_usage Flag that indicates how a credential is used. The cred_usage parameter may contain one of the following
values: GSS_C_INITIATE, GSS_C_ACCEPT, or GSS_C_BOTH. Specify NULL if this parameter is not re<hy>
quired.
mechanisms Set of mechanisms supported by the credential. Storage for the returned OID-set must be freed by the
application after use by a call to gss_release_oid_set(3GSS). Specify NULL if this parameter is not required.
Use the gss_inquire_cred() function to obtain information about a credential.
The gss_inquire_cred() function can return the following status codes:
GSS_S_COMPLETE Successful completion.
GSS_S_NO_CRED The referenced credentials could not be accessed.
GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_CREDENTIAL The referenced credentials were invalid.
GSS_S_CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED The referenced credentials have expired. If the lifetime parameter was not
passed as NULL, it will be set to 0.
GSS_S_FAILURE The underlying mechanism detected an error for which no specific GSS status code is defined.
The mechanism-specific status code reported by means of the minor_status parameter details the error condition.
