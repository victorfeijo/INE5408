getent <-> get entries from administrative database
getent database [key]...
getent gets a list of entries from the administrative database specified by database. The information generally comes
from one or more of the sources that are specified for the database in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
database is the name of the database to be examined. This can be passwd, group, hosts, ipnodes, services, proto<hy>
cols, ethers, project, networks, or netmasks. For each of these databases, getent uses the appropriate library rou<hy>
tines described in getpwnam(3C), getgrnam(3C), gethostbyaddr(3NSL), gethostbyname(3NSL), getipnodebyad<hy>
dr(3SOCKET), getipnodebyname(3SOCKET), getservbyname(3SOCKET), getprotobyname(3SOCKET),
ethers(3SOCKET), getprojbyname(3PROJECT) and getnetbyname(3SOCKET), respectively.
Each key must be in a format appropriate for searching on the respective database. For example, it can be a username
or numeric-uid for passwd; hostname or IP address for hosts; or service, service/protocol, port, or port/proto for
services.
getent prints out the database entries that match each of the supplied keys, one per line, in the format of the match<hy>
ing administrative file: passwd(4), group(4), project(4), hosts(4), services(4), protocols(4), ethers(3SOCKET),
networks(4), or netmasks(4). If no key is given, all entries returned by the corresponding enumeration library rou<hy>
tine, for example, getpwent() or gethostent(), are printed. Enumeration is not supported on ipnodes.
When getent is invoked with database set to passwd, each key value is processed as follows: <bu> If the key value con<hy>
sists only of numeric characters, getent assumes that the key value is a numeric user ID and searches the user data<hy>
base for a matching user ID. <bu> If the user ID is not found in the user database or if the key value contains any non-
numeric characters, getent assumes the key value is a user name and searches the user database for a matching user
name.
Similarly, when getent is invoked with database set to group, each key value is processed as follows: <bu> If the key
value consists only of numeric characters, getent assumes that the key value is a numeric group ID and searches the
group database for a matching group ID. <bu> If the group ID is not found in the group database or if the key value
contains any non-numeric characters, getent assumes the key value is a group name and searches the group database
for a matching group name.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
1 Command syntax was incorrect, an invalid option was used, or an internal error occurred.
2 At least one of the specified entry names was not found in the database.
3 There is no support for enumeration on this database.
