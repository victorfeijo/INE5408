int FCOE_GetPortList(unsigned int *port_num,
 struct fcoe_port_attr **portlist);
port_num A pointer to an integer that, on successful return, contains the number of FCoE ports in the system.
portlist A pointer to a pointer to an fcoe_port_attr structure that, on successful return, contains a list of the FCoE
ports in the system.
The FCOE_GetPortList() function retrieves a list of FCoE ports. When the caller is finished using the list, it must
free the memory used by the list by calling free(3C).
The following values are returned:
FCOE_STATUS_ERROR_BUSY
The fcoe driver is busy and cannot complete the operation.
FCOE_STATUS_ERROR_INVAL_ARG
The value specified for port_num or portlist was not valid.
FCOE_STATUS_ERROR_OPEN_DEV
