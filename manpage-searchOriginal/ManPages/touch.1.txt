touch, settime <-> change file access and modification times
touch [-acm] [-r ref_file | -t time | -d date_time] file...
touch [-acm] [time_spec] file...
settime [-f ref_file] [time_spec] file...
The touch utility sets the access and modification times of each file. The file operand is created if it does not already
exist.
The time used can be specified by -t time, by -d date_time, by the corresponding time fields of the file referenced by
-r ref_file, or by the time_spec operand. If none of these are specified, touch uses the current time.
If neither the -a nor -m options are specified, touch updates both the modification and access times.
A user with write access to a file, but who is not the owner of the file or a super-user, can change the modification
and access times of that file only to the current time. Attempts to set a specific time with touch results in an error.
The settime utility is equivalent to touch -c [time_spec] file.
The following options are supported in the touch and settime utilities:
The following options are supported for the touch utility:
-a
Changes the access time of file. Does not change the modification time unless -m is also specified.
-c
Does not create a specified file if it does not exist. Does not write any diagnostic messages concerning this condition.
-d date_time
Uses the specified date_time instead of the current time. The option-argument must be a string of the form:
 YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:SS[.frac][tz]
or
 YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:SS[,frac][tz]
where <bu> YYYY is at least four decimal digits giving the year <bu> MM, DD, hh, mm, and SS are as with -t time <bu> T is ei<hy>
ther the letter T or a single SPACE character <bu> [.frac] and [,frac] are either empty, or a period (.) or a comma (,) re<hy>
spectively, followed by one or more decimal digits, specifying a fractional second <bu> [tz] is either empty, signifying
local time, or the letter Z, signifying UTC. If [tz] is empty, the resulting time is affected by the value of the TZ envi<hy>
ronment variable
-m
Changes the modification time of file. Does not change the access time unless -a is also specified.
-r ref_file
Uses the corresponding times of the file named by ref_file instead of the current time.
-t time
Uses the specified time instead of the current time. time is a decimal number of the form:
 [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]
<beginning of page>
where each two digits represent the following:
MM
The month of the year [01-12].
DD
The day of the month [01-31].
hh
The hour of the day [00-23].
mm
The minute of the hour [00-59].
CC
The first two digits of the year.
YY
The second two digits of the year.
SS
The second of the minute [00-61].
Both CC and YY are optional. If neither is given, the current year is assumed. If YY is specified, but CC is not, CC is
derived as follows:
tab() box; cw(2.75i) cw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) If YY is:CC becomes: _ 69-9919 00-3820 39-68ERROR
The resulting time is affected by the value of the TZ environment variable. If the resulting time value precedes the
Epoch, touch exits immediately with an error status. The range of valid times is the Epoch to January 18, 2038.
The range for SS is [00-61] rather than [00-59] because of leap seconds. If SS is 60 or 61, and the resulting time, as
affected by the TZ environment variable, does not refer to a leap second, the resulting time is one or two seconds af<hy>
ter a time where SS is 59. If SS is not given, it is assumed to be 0.
The following option is supported for the settime utility:
-f ref_file
Uses the corresponding times of the file named by ref_file instead of the current time.
The following operands are supported for the touch and settime utilities:
file
A path name of a file whose times are to be modified.
time_spec
Uses the specified time_spec instead of the current time. This operand is a decimal number of the form:
<beginning of page>
 MMDDhhmm[YY]
where each two digits represent the following:
MM
The month of the year [01-12].
DD
The day of the month [01-31].
hh
The hour of the day [00-23].
mm
The minute of the hour [00-59].
YY
The second two digits of the year.
YY is optional. If it is omitted, the current year is assumed. If YY is specified, the year is derived as follows:
tab() box; cw(2.75i) cw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) lw(2.75i) YYCorresponding Year 69-991969-1999 00-382000-2038
39-68ERROR
If no -d, -r, or -toption is specified, at least two operands are specified, and the first operand is an eight- or ten-digit
decimal integer, the first operand is assumed to be a time_spec operand. Otherwise, the first operand is assumed to
be a file operand.
See largefile(5) for the description of the behavior of touch when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte
( 2^31 bytes).
See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of touch: LANG,
LC_ALL, LANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.
TZ
Determine the timezone to be used for interpreting the time or date_time option-argument or the time_spec operand.
The following exit values are returned:
0
The touch utility executed successfully and all requested changes were made.
>0
An error occurred. The touch utility returned the number of files for which the times could not be successfully mod<hy>
ified.

Users familiar with the BSD environment find that for the touch utility, the -f option is accepted but ignored. The -f
option is unnecessary because touch succeeds for all files owned by the user regardless of the permissions on the
files.
