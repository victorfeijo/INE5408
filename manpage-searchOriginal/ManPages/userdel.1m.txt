The userdel utility only deletes an account definition that is in the local /etc/group, /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, and
/etc/user_attr file. file. If a network name service such as NIS or NIS+ is being used to supplement the local
/etc/passwd file with additional entries, userdel cannot change information supplied by the network name service.
