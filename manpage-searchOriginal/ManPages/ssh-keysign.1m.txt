ssh-keysign <-> ssh helper program for host-based authentication
ssh-keysign
ssh-keysign is used by ssh(1) to access the local host keys and generate the digital signature required during host-
based authentication with SSH protocol version 2. This signature is of data that includes, among other items, the
name of the client host and the name of the client user.
ssh-keysign is disabled by default and can be enabled only in the global client configuration file /etc/ssh/ssh_config
by setting HostbasedAuthentication to yes.
ssh-keysign is not intended to be invoked by the user, but from ssh. See ssh(1) and sshd(1M) for more information
about host-based authentication.
/etc/ssh/ssh_config Controls whether ssh-keysign is enabled.
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key These files contain the private parts of the host keys used to generate the digital signa<hy>
ture. They should be owned by root, readable only by root, and not accessible to others. Because they are readable
only by root, ssh-keysign must be set-uid root if host-based authentication is used.
ssh-keysign will not sign host-based authentication data under the following conditions: <bu> If the HostbasedAuthen<hy>
tication client configuration parameter is not set to yes in /etc/ssh/ssh_config. This setting cannot be overriden in
users' ~/.ssh/ssh_config files. <bu> If the client hostname and username in /etc/ssh/ssh_config do not match the canoni<hy>
cal hostname of the client where ssh-keysign is invoked and the name of the user invoking ssh-keysign.
In spite of ssh-keysign's restrictions on the contents of the host-based authentication data, there remains the ability
of users to use it as an avenue for obtaining the client's private host keys. For this reason host-based authentication is
turned off by default.
