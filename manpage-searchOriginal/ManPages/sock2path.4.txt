sock2path <-> socket mapping file that maps sockets to transport providers
/etc/sock2path
The socket mapping file, /etc/sock2path, is a system file that contains the mappings between the socket(3SOCKET)
call parameters and the transport provider driver. Its format is described on the soconfig(1M) manual page.
The init(1M) utility uses the soconfig utility with the sock2path file during the boot sequence. Example 1 An Ex<hy>
