pkg2du <-> convert driver packages to Driver Update format
/usr/bin/pkg2du [-f] [-v] [-d dir] [-o iso] [-l label]
 [-r release] pkg [pkg ...]
The /usr/bin/pkg2du utility takes one or more packages as input and converts them to Driver Update (DU) format.
If the -d option is specified, the resulting DU directory tree is placed in the directory dir. If the -o option is specified,
a Solaris ISO image of the DU directory tree is written in the file iso. The ISO image can be burned onto CD/DVD
using cdrw(1) or cdrecord(1) (not a SunOS man page) and used during Solaris installation.
At least one of the -d and -o options must be specified. If both are specified, then both an ISO image and a directory
tree are generated.
The following options are supported:
-d dir
Directory where the DU directory should be created.
-o iso
Create a Solaris ISO image of the DU directory.
-f
If dir/DU or iso exists, remove it without asking first.
-l label
Label/volume name of the ISO image (if -o option is specified).
-r release
Solaris release number to use. It takes the form of the return from uname -r command, for example, 5.10. If unspec<hy>
ified, the release number of the currently running Solaris is used.
-v
Verbose. Multiple -v options increase verbosity.
The following operands are supported:
pkg [pkg...]
One or more packages to be converted to DU format.
Example 1 Creating a DU CD/DVD
The following commands create a DU CD or DVD containing packages SUNWfoo and SUNWbar.
 # /usr/bin/pkg2du -r 5.10 -o my.iso SUNWfoo SUNWbar
 # /usr/bin/cdrw -i my.iso
