nischgrp <-> change the group owner of a NIS+ object
nischgrp [-AfLP] group name...
nischgrp changes the group owner of the NIS+ objects or entries specified by name to the specified NIS+ group.
Entries are specified using indexed names (see nismatch(1)). If group is not a fully qualified NIS+ group name, it
will be resolved using the directory search path (see nisdefaults(1)).
The only restriction on changing an object's group owner is that you must have modify permissions for the object.
This command will fail if the master NIS+ server is not running.
The NIS+ server will check the validity of the group name prior to effecting the modification.
The following options are supported:
-A Modify all entries in all tables in the concatenation path that match the search criterion specified in name. This
option implies the -P switch.
-f Force the operation and fail silently if it does not succeed.
-L Follow links and change the group owner of the linked object or entries rather than the group owner of the link it<hy>
self.
-P Follow the concatenation path within a named table. This option only makes sense when either name is an in<hy>
dexed name or the -L switch is also specified and the named object is a link pointing to entries.
Example 1 Using the nischgrp Command
The following two examples show how to change the group owner of an object to a group in a different domain, and
how to change it to a group in the local domain, respectively.
 example% nischgrp newgroup.remote.domain. object
 example% nischgrp my-buds object
This example shows how to change the group owner for a password entry.
 example% nischgrp admins '[uid=99],passwd.org_dir'
In the previous example, admins is a NIS+ group in the same domain.
The next two examples change the group owner of the object or entries pointed to by a link, and the group owner of
all entries in the hobbies table.
 example% nischgrp -L my-buds linkname
 example% nischgrp my-buds '[],hobbies'
NIS_PATH If this variable is set, and the NIS+ name is not fully qualified, each directory specified will be searched
until the object is found (see nisdefaults(1)).
The following exit values are returned:

0 Successful operation.
1 Operation failed.

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
NIS+ to LDAP are available in the current Solaris release. For more information, visit http://www.sun.com/directo<hy>
