Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI)
The device qualifier descriptor usb_dev_qlf_descr_t defines how fields of a high speed device's device descriptor
would look if that device is run at a different speed. If a high-speed device is running currently at full/high speed,
fields of this descriptor reflect how device descriptor fields would look if speed was changed to high/full. Please re<hy>
fer to section 9.6.2 of the USB 2.0 specification. The USB 2.0 specification is available at www.usb.org.
A device descriptor contains the following fields:
 uint8_t bLength Size of this descriptor.
 uint8_t bDescriptorType Set to USB_DESCR_TYPE_DEV_QLF.
 uint16_t bcdUSB USB specification release
  number in binary coded decimal.
 uint8_t bDeviceClass Device class code.
  (See usb_dev_descr(9s).)
 uint8_t bDeviceSubClass Device subclass code.(See
  USB 2.0 specification of
  applicable device class for
  information.)
 uint8_t bDeviceProtocol Protocol code.(See
  USB 2.0 specification of
  applicable device class for
  information.)
 uint8_t bMaxPacketSize0 Maximum packet size of
  endpoint 0.
 uint8_t bNumConfigurations Number of available
  configurations.
 uint8_t bReserved Reserved.
