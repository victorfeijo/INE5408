int sasl_getprop(sasl_conn_t *conn, int propnum, const void **pvalue);
Use the sasl_getprop() interface to get the value of a SASL property. For example, after successful authentication, a
server may want to know the authorization name. Similarly, a client application may want to know the strength of
the security level that was negotiated.
conn The SASL connection context.
propnum The identifier for the property requested.
pvalue The value of the SASL property. This value is filled in upon a successful call. Possible SASL values include:
SASL_USERNAME A pointer to a null-terminated user name.
SASL_SSF The security layer security strength factor. If the value of SASL_SSF is 0, a call to sasl_encode() or
sasl_decode() is unnecessary.
SASL_MAXOUTBUF The maximum size of output buffer returned by the selected security mechanism
SASL_DEFUSERREALM Server authentication realm used.
SASL_GETOPTCTX The context for getopt() callback.
SASL_IPLOCALPORT Local address string.
SASL_IPREMOTEPORT Remote address string.
SASL_SERVICE Service passed on to sasl_*_new().
SASL_SERVERFQDN Server FQDN passed on to sasl_*_new().
SASL_AUTHSOURCE Name of authentication source last used. Useful for failed authentication tracking.
SASL_MECHNAME Active mechanism name, if any.
SASL_PLUGERR Similar to sasl_errdetail().
SASL_OK The call to sasl_getprop() was successful.
