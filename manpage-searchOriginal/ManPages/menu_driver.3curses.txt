int menu_driver(MENU *menu, int c);
menu_driver() is the workhorse of the menus subsystem. It checks to determine whether the character c is a menu
request or data. If c is a request, the menu driver executes the request and reports the result. If c is data (a printable
ASCII character), it enters the data into the pattern buffer and tries to find a matching item. If no match is found, the
menu driver deletes the character from the pattern buffer and returns E_NO_MATCH. If the character is not recog<hy>
nized, the menu driver assumes it is an application-defined command and returns E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND.
Menu driver requests:
REQ_LEFT_ITEM Move left to an item.
REQ_RIGHT_ITEM  Move right to an item
REQ_UP_ITEM Move up to an item.
REQ_DOWN_ITEM Move down to an item.
REQ_SCR_ULINE Scroll up a line.
REQ_SCR_DLINE Scroll down a line.
REQ_SCR_DPAGE Scroll up a page.
REQ_SCR_UPAGE Scroll down a page.
REQ_FIRST_ITEM Move to the first item.
REQ_LAST_ITEM Move to the last item.
REQ_NEXT_ITEM Move to the next item.
REQ_PREV_ITEM Move to the previous item.
REQ_TOGGLE_ITEM Select/de-select an item.
REQ_CLEAR_PATTERN Clear the menu pattern buffer.
REQ_BACK_PATTERN Delete the previous character from pattern buffer.
REQ_NEXT_MATCH Move the next matching item.
REQ_PREV_MATCH Move to the previous matching item.
