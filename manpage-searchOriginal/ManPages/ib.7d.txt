ib <-> InfiniBand Bus Nexus Driver
The ib (IB nexus) driver is a pseudo nexus driver that supports enumeration of port devices, VPPA (Virtual Physical
Point Attachment), HCA_SVC (HCA Service) devices, and I/O controllers (IOC) on the InfiniBand fabric that are
visible to the host and provides interfaces to cfgadm_ib(1M) to manage hot-plugging of IB devices. The ib nexus
driver enumerates the port device, VPPA devices and HCA_SVC devices based on entries specified in the ib.conf
file. IOC devices are enumerated on demand. The IB nexus driver uses InfiniBand Device Manager services (ib<hy>
dm(7D)) to enumerate port devices, VPPA devices, HCA_SVC devices, and IOCs on the IB fabric.
You configure the ib driver by defining properties in the ib.conf file. The IB nexus driver supports the following
properties:
tab() box; lw(0i) |lw(0i) |lw(5.5i) lw(0i) |lw(0i) |lw(5.5i) PROPERTY NAMEDEFAULTPOSSIBLE VALUES _ port-
svc-list""T{ List of service names, for example: srv T} _ vppa-svc-list""List of service names, for example: ipib _
hca-svc-list""T{ List of service names, for example: hca_nfs T}
The port-svc-list property defines the list of port communication service names per port. The IB nexus driver creates
a device instance for each entry in this property per Host Channel Adapter (HCA) port. The ib.conf file contains a
port-svc-list="" entry by default. You update port-svc-list with service names you want to add to the system.
The vppa-svc-list property defines the list of VPPA communication service names per port per partition key. The IB
nexus driver creates a device instance for each entry in this property per Host Channel Adapter (HCA) port. The
ib.conf file contains a vppa-svc-list="" entry by default. You update vppa-svc-list with service names you want to
add to the system.
The hca-svc-list property defines the list of HCA_SVC communication service names per HCA. The IB nexus driv<hy>
er creates a device instance for each entry in this property per Host Channel Adapter (HCA). The ib.conf file con<hy>
tains a hca-svc-list="" entry by default. You update hca-svc-list with service names you want to add to the system.
The service name specified in port-svc-list, vppa-svc-list and hca-svc-list must be unique, be a maximum of four
characters long, and is limited to digits 0-9 and letters a-z and A-Z.
IOC drivers (which are parented by the IB nexus driver) may themselves have .conf files. To distinguish those cases
from pseudo drivers parented by IB nexus, such drivers should include the "ib-node-type" property with value
merge in the IOC driver.conf file. That property ensures that properties from the .conf file are merged with other
properties found through hardware probing.
Example 1: A sample ib.conf file with one service name entry for PORT communication services.

  port-svc-list=""
  vppa-svc-list="";
  hca-svc-list="";
In Example 1, the IB nexus driver does not create any port/vppa/hca_svc device instances.
Example 2: A sample ib.conf file with one entry for "srv" service:
  port-svc-list="srv"
  vppa-svc-list="";
  hca-svc-list="";
The IB nexus driver creates one srv service instance for every HCA port that exists on the host. For example, if
there are two HCAs, each with two ports on the host, the IB nexus driver creates four instances of the srv service.
Example 3: A sample ib.conf file with one service name entry for each of Port and VPPA communication ser<hy>
vices:
<beginning of page>
  port-svc-list="srv"
  vppa-svc-list="ipib";
  hca-svc-list="";
If there are two HCAs in the system with two ports each and each port has two valid PKEY values, the IB nexus
driver creates four instances of srv service (one for each port). It also creates eight instances of ipd service (one per
each port/PKEY combination).
Example 4: A sample ib.conf file with one service name entry for each of Port, VPPA and HCA_SVC communi<hy>
cation services:
  port-svc-list="srv";
  vppa-svc-list="ipib";
  hca-svc-list="hca_nfs";
The IB nexus driver creates one instance of hca_nfs service for each HCA in the system.
Example 5: IOC driver .conf
  ib-node-type="merge";
  enable-special-mode="on";
