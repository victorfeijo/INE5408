sum <-> calculate a checksum for a file
/usr/ucb/sum file...
sum calculates and displays a 16-bit checksum for the named file and displays the size of the file in kilobytes. It is
typically used to look for bad spots, or to validate a file communicated over some transmission line. The checksum
is calculated by an algorithm which may yield different results on machines with 16-bit ints and machines with
32-bit ints, so it cannot always be used to validate that a file has been transferred between machines with different-
sized ints.
See largefile(5) for the description of the behavior of sum when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte (
2^31 bytes).
See attributes(5) for descriptions of the following attributes:

Read error is indistinguishable from EOF on most devices; check the block count.
sum and /usr/bin/sum (see sum(1)) return different checksums.
This utility is obsolete.
