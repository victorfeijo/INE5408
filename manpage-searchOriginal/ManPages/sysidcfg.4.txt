sysidcfg <-> system identification configuration file
When a diskless client boots for the first time or a system installs over the network, the booting software tries to ob<hy>
tain configuration information about the system, such as the system's root password or name service, from, first, a
sysidcfg file and then the name service databases. If the booting software cannot find the information, it prompts the
user for it. Like the name service databases, the sysidcfg file can be used to avoid the user prompts and provide a to<hy>
tally hands-off booting process.
The sysidcfg file preconfigures information through a set of keywords. You can specify one or more of the keywords
to preconfigure as much information as you want. Each set of systems (one or more) that has unique configuration
information must have its own sysidcfg file. For example, you can use the same sysidcfg file to preconfigure the
time zone for multiple systems if you want all the systems to have the same time zone configured. However, if you
want to preconfigure a different root password for each of those systems, then each system would need its own
sysidcfg file.
If a syntax error (such as an invalid keyword) is detected when reading the sysidcfg file, an error message that notes
the position in the file where the error was found is sent to the console. Under such a condition, the file is not used.
The sysidcfg file can reside on a shared NFS network directory or the root directory on a UFS or PCFS diskette in
the system's diskette drive. If you put the sysidcfg file on a shared NFS network directory, you have to use the -p op<hy>
tion of the add_install_client(1M) command (see install_scripts(1M)) to specify where the system being installed
can find the sysidcfg file. If you put the sysidcfg file on a diskette, you need to make sure the diskette is in the sys<hy>
tem's diskette drive when the system boots (on x86 systems, the sysidcfg file should reside on the Solaris Device
Configuration Assistant diskette).
Only one sysidcfg file can reside in a directory or diskette. If you are creating more than one sysidcfg file, they must
reside in different directories or diskettes.
The following rules apply to the keywords in a sysidcfg file: <bu> Keywords can be in any order <bu> Keywords are not
case-sensitive <bu> Keyword values can be optionally enclosed in single (') or double (") quotes <bu> Only the first instance
of a keyword is valid; if you specify the same keyword more than once, the first keyword specified is used. The net<hy>
work_interface keyword is exempt from this rule.
The following keywords apply to both SPARC and x86 platforms.
Naming-related keywords are as follows:
 name_service=NIS,NIS+,LDAP,DNS,NONE
For the NIS and NIS+ keywords, the options are:
 domain_name=domain_name
 name_server=hostname(ip_address)
The following is an example NIS entry:
 name_service=NIS
 {domain_name=west.arp.com name_server=timber(172.16.2.1)}
For NIS+, the example is identical to the one above, except for the replacement of the keyword NIS by NIS+.
For DNS, the syntax is:
 domain_name=domain_name; name_server=ip_address, ... ;
 search=domain_name, ...
You can have a maximum of three IP addresses and six domain names. The total length of a search entry cannot ex<hy>
ceed 250 characters. The following is an example DNS entry:
 name_service=DNS
 {domain_name=west.arp.com
 name_server=10.0.1.10,10.0.1.20
<beginning of page>
 search=arp.com,east.arp.com}
For LDAP, the syntax is:
 domain_name=domain_name;
 profile=profile_name;
 profile_server=ip_address;
 proxy_dn="proxy_bind_dn";
 proxy_password=password
The proxy_dn and proxy_password keywords are optional. If proxy_dn is used, the value must be enclosed in
double quotes.
The following is an example LDAP entry:
 name_service=LDAP
 {domain_name=west.arp.com
 profile=default
 profile_server=172.16.2.1
 proxy_dn="cn=proxyagent,ou=profile,dc=west,dc=arp,dc=com"
 proxy_password=password}
Choose only one value for name_service. Include either, both, or neither of the domain_name and name_server
keywords, as needed. If no keywords are used, omit the curly braces.
There is only one keyword for specifying the NFSv4 default domain name:
 nfs4_domain=dynamic, value
where value must be a fully qualified domain name, as per RFC1033 and RFC1035 recommendations. The reserved
value dynamic suppresses the front-end installation prompt. At the same time, use of dynamic enables the NFSv4
domain to be derived dynamically, at run time, based on naming service configuration.
For example:
 nfs4_domain=example.com
...hard codes the value used by the nfsmapid(1M) daemon to be example.com. In contrast, the following example
shows how to set the nfs4_domain variable to the reserved keyword dynamic:
 nfs4_domain=dynamic
The preceding example enables the nfsmapid(1M) daemon to derive the domain from the system's configured nam<hy>
ing services, as prescribed in the System Administration Guide: Network Services.
Network-related keywords are as follows:
 network_interface=NONE, PRIMARY, value
where value is a name of a network interface, for example, eri0 or hme0.
For the NONE keyword, the options are:
 hostname=hostname
For example,
 network_interface=NONE {hostname=feron}
<beginning of page>
For the PRIMARY and value keywords, the options are:
 primary (used only with multiple network_interface lines)
 dhcp
 hostname=hostname
 ip_address=ip_address
 netmask=netmask
 protocol_ipv6=yes | no
 default_route=ip_address (IPv4 address only)
If you are using the dhcp option, the only other option you can specify is protocol_ipv6. For example:
 network_interface=PRIMARY {dhcp protocol_ipv6=yes}
If you are not using DHCP, you can specify any combination of the other keywords as needed. If you do not use any
of the keywords, omit the curly braces.
 network_interface=eri0 {hostname=feron
  ip_address=172.16.2.7
  netmask=255.255.255.0
  protocol_ipv6=no
  default_route=172.16.2.1}
If you have multiple network interfaces on your system, you can configure them all in the sysidcfg file by defining
multiple network_interface keywords. If you specify multiple network_interface keywords, you cannot use
NONE or PRIMARY for values. You must specify interface names for all of the values. To specify the primary in<hy>
terface, use the primary option value.
For example,
 network_interface=eri0 {primary
  hostname=feron
  ip_address=172.16.2.7
  netmask=255.255.255.0
  protocol_ipv6=no
  default_route=172.16.2.1}
 network_interface=eri1 {hostname=feron-b
  ip_address=172.16.3.8
  netmask=255.255.255.0
  protocol_ipv6=no
  default_route=172.16.3.1}
The root password keyword is root_password. Possible values are encrypted from /etc/shadow. Syntax is:
 root_password=encrypted_password
The security<em>related keyword is security_policy. It has the following syntax:
 security_policy=kerberos, NONE
The kerberos keyword has the following options:
 {default_realm=FQDN admin_server=FQDN kdc=FQDN1, FQDN2, FQDN3}
where FQDN is a fully qualified domain name. An example of the security_policy keyword is as follows:
<beginning of page>
 security_policy=kerberos {default_realm=Yoursite.COM
 admin_server=krbadmin.Yoursite.COM
 kdc=kdc1.Yoursite.COM, kdc2.Yoursite.COM}
You can list a maximum of three key distribution centers (KDCs) for a security_policy keyword. At least one is re<hy>
quired.
The system-location keyword is system_locale. It has the following syntax:
 system_locale=locale
where locale is /usr/lib/locale.
The terminal keyword is terminal. It has the following syntax:
 terminal=terminal_type
where terminal_type is a value from /usr/share/lib/terminfo/*.
The timezone keyword is timezone. It has the following syntax:
 timezone=timezone
where timezone is a value from /usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/*or, where timezone is an offset-from-GMT style quoted
timezone. Refer to environ(5) for information on quoted timezones. An example of a quoted timezone is: time<hy>
zone="<GMT+8>+8".
The time server keyword is timeserver. It has the following syntax:
 timeserver=localhost
 timeserver=hostname
 timeserver=ip_address
If you specify localhost as the time server, the system's time is assumed to be correct. If you specify the hostname or
ip_address, if you are not running a name service, of a system, that system's time is used to set the time.
The keyboard keyword is keyboard. It has the following syntax:
 keyboard=keyboard_layout
The valid keyboard_layout strings are defined in the /usr/share/lib/keytables/type_6/kbd_layouts file. Example 1
Sample sysidcfg files
The following example is a sysidcfg file for a group of SPARC systems to install over the network. The host names,
IP addresses, and netmask of these systems have been preconfigured by editing the name service. Because all the
system configuration information has been preconfigured, an automated installation can be achieved by using this
sysidcfg file in conjunction with a custom JumpStart profile.
 keyboard=US-English
 system_locale=en_US
 timezone=US/Central
 timeserver=localhost
 terminal=sun-cmd
 name_service=NIS {domain_name=marquee.central.example.com
  name_server=connor(172.16.112.3)}
 root_password=m4QPOWNY
 system_locale=C
 security_policy=kerberos
  {default_realm=Yoursite.COM
<beginning of page>
  admin_server=krbadmin.Yoursite.COM
  kdc=kdc1.Yoursite.COM, kdc2.Yoursite.COM}
The following example is a sysidcfg file created for a group of x86 systems to install over the network that all have
the same keyboard, graphics cards, and pointing devices. In this example, users would see only the prompt to select
a language, system_locale, for displaying the rest of the Solaris installation program.
 keyboard=US-English
 display=ati {size=15-inch}
 pointer=MS-S
 timezone=US/Central
 timeserver=connor
 terminal=AT386
 name_service=NIS {domain_name=marquee.central.example.com
  name_server=connor(172.16.112.3)}
 root_password=URFUni9
 security_policy=none
