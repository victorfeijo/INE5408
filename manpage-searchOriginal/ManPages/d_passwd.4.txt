d_passwd <-> dial-up password file
/etc/d_passwd
A dial-up password is an additional password required of users who access the computer through a modem or dial-
up port. The correct password must be entered before the user is granted access to the computer.
d_passwd is an ASCII file which contains a list of executable programs (typically shells) that require a dial-up pass<hy>
word and the associated encrypted passwords. When a user attempts to log in on any of the ports listed in the di<hy>
alups file (see dialups(4)), the login program looks at the user's login entry stored in the passwd file (see pass<hy>
wd(4)), and compares the login shell field to the entries in d_passwd. These entries determine whether the user will
be required to supply a dial-up password.
Each entry in d_passwd is a single line of the form:
 login-shell:password:
where
login-shell The name of the login program that will require an additional dial-up password.
password An encrypted password. Users accessing the computer through a dial-up port or modem using login-shell
will be required to enter this password before gaining access to the computer.
d_passwd should be owned by the root user and the root group. The file should have read and write permissions for
the owner (root) only.
If the user's login program in the passwd file is not found in d_passwd or if the login shell field in passwd is empty,
the user must supply the default password. The default password is the entry for /usr/bin/sh. If d_passwd has no en<hy>
try for /usr/bin/sh, then those users whose login shell field in passwd is empty or does not match any entry in
d_passwd will not be prompted for a dial-up password.
Dial-up logins are disabled if d_passwd has only the following entry:
 /usr/bin/sh:*:
Example 1 Sample d_passwd file.
Here is a sample d_passwd file:
 /usr/lib/uucp/uucico:q.mJzTnu8icF0:
 /usr/bin/csh:6k/7KCFRPNVXg:
 /usr/bin/ksh:9df/FDf.4jkRt:
 /usr/bin/sh:41FuGVzGcDJlw:
The passwd (see passwd(1)) utility can be used to generate the encrypted password for each login program. passwd
generates encrypted passwords for users and places the password in the shadow (see shadow(4)) file. Passwords for
the d_passwd file will need to be generated by first adding a temporary user id using useradd (see useradd(1M)),
and then using passwd(1) to generate the desired password in the shadow file. Once the encrypted version of the
password has been created, it can be copied to the d_passwd file.
For example: 1. Type useradd tempuser and press Return. This creates a user named tempuser. 2. Type passwd
tempuser and press Return. This creates an encrypted password for tempuser and places it in the shadow file. 3.
Find the entry for tempuser in the shadow file and copy the encrypted password to the desired entry in the d_pass<hy>
wd file. 4. Type userdel tempuser and press Return to delete tempuser.
These steps must be executed as the root user.

When creating a new dial-up password, be sure to remain logged in on at least one terminal while testing the new
password. This ensures that there is an available terminal from which you can correct any mistakes that were made
when the new password was added.
