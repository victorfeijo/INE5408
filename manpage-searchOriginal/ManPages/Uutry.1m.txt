Uutry, uutry <-> attempt to contact remote system with debugging on
/usr/lib/uucp/Uutry [-r] [-c type] [-x debug-level] system-name
Uutry is a shell script that is used to invoke uucico(1M) to call a remote site. Debugging is initially turned on and is
set to the default value of 5. The debugging output is put in file /tmp/system-name.
The following options are supported:
-r This option overrides the retry time that is set in file /var/uucp/.Status/system-name.
-c type The first field in the Devices file is the "Type" field. The -c option forces uucico to use only entries in the
"Type" field that match the user-specified type. The specified type is usually the name of a local area network.
-x debug-level debug-level is a number from 0 to 9. Higher numbers give more detailed debugging information.
