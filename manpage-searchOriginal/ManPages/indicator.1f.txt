indicator <-> display application specific alarms and/or the "working" indicator
indicator [-b [n]] [-c column] [-l length] [-o] [-w]
 [string]...
The indicator function displays application specific alarms or the "working" indicator, or both, on the FMLI ban<hy>
ner line. The argument string is a string to be displayed on the banner line, and should always be the last argument
given. Note that string is not automatically cleared from the banner line.
-bn The -b option rings the terminal bell n times, where n is an integer from 1 to 10. The default value is 1. If the ter<hy>
minal has no bell, the screen is flashed instead, if possible.
-c column The -c option defines the column of the banner line at which to start the indicator string. The argument
column must be an integer from 0 to DISPLAYW-1. If the -c option is not used, column defaults to 0 .
-l length The -l option defines the maximum length of the string displayed. If string is longer than length characters,
it will be truncated. The argument length must be an integer from 1 to DISPLAYW. If the -l option is not used,
length defaults to DISPLAYW. Note that if string doesn't fit it will be truncated.
-o The -o option causes indicator to duplicate its output to stdout .
-w The -w option turns on the "working" indicator.
Example 1 A sample output of the indicator command.
When the value entered in a form field is invalid, the following use of indicator will ring the bell three times and
display the word WRONG starting at column 1 of the banner line.
 invalidmsg=`indicator -b 3 -c 1 "WRONG"`
To clear the indicator after telling the user the entry is wrong:
 invalidmsg=`indicator -b 9 -c 1 "WRONG"; sleep 3;
  indicator -c 1 " "`
In this example the value of invalidmsg (in this case the default value Input is not valid), still appears on the FM<hy>
LI message line.
