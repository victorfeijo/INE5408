pkginfo [-q | -x | -l] [-p | -i] [-r] [-a arch]
 [-v version] [-c category]... [pkginst]...
pkginfo [-d device] [-R root_path] [-q | -x | -l] [-a arch]
 [-v version] [-c category]... [pkginst]...
pkginfo displays information about software packages that are installed on the system (with the first synopsis) or
that reside on a particular device or directory (with the second synopsis).
Without options, pkginfo lists the primary category, package instance, and the names of all completely installed and
partially installed packages. It displays one line for each package selected.
The -p and -i options are meaningless if used in conjunction with the -d option.
The options -q, -x, and -l are mutually exclusive.
-a arch
Specify the architecture of the package as arch.
-c category
Display packages that match category. Categories are defined with the CATEGORY parameter in the pkginfo(4)
file. If more than one category is supplied, the package needs to match only one category in the list. The match is
not case specific.
-d device
Defines a device, device, on which the software resides. device can be an absolute directory pathname or the identi<hy>
fiers for tape, floppy disk, removable disk, and so forth. The special token spool may be used to indicate the default
installation spool directory (/var/spool/pkg).
-i
Display information for fully installed packages only.
-l
Specify long format, which includes all available information about the designated package(s).
-p
Display information for partially installed packages only.
-q
Do not list any information. Used from a program to check whether or not a package has been installed.
-r
List the installation base for relocatable packages.
-R root_path
Defines the full path name of a directory to use as the root_path. All files, including package system information
files, are relocated to a directory tree starting in the specified root_path.

-v version
Specify the version of the package as version. The version is defined with the VERSION parameter in the pkgin<hy>
fo(4) file. All compatible versions can be requested by preceding the version name with a tilde (<ap>). Multiple white
spaces are replaced with a single white space during version comparison.
-x
Designate an extracted listing of package information. The listing contains the package abbreviation, package name,
package architecture (if available) and package version (if available).
pkginst
A package designation by its instance. An instance can be the package abbreviation or a specific instance (for exam<hy>
ple, inst.1 or inst.2). All instances of a package can be requested by inst.*. The asterisk character (*) is a special
character to some shells and may need to be escaped. In the C-Shell, "*" must be surrounded by single quotes (') or
preceded by a backslash (\).
0
Successful completion.
>0

Application Packaging Developer's Guide
Package commands are largefile(5)-aware. They handle files larger than 2 GB in the same way they handle smaller
files. In their current implementations, pkgadd(1M), pkgtrans(1) and other package commands can process a datas<hy>
tream of up to 4 GB.
