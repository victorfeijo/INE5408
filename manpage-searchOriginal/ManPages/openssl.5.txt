openssl <-> OpenSSL cryptographic and Secure Sockets Layer toolkit
OpenSSL is a cryptography toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSLv2/v3) and Transport Layer Se<hy>
curity (TLS v1) network protocols.
The following features are omitted from the binaries for issues including but not limited to patents, trademark, and
US export restrictions: ECC, IDEA, MDC2, RC3, RC5, Dynamic Engine Loading, 4758_CCA Engine, AEP En<hy>
gine, Atalla Engine, CHIL Engine, CSWIFT Engine, GMP Engine, NURON Engine, PadLock Engine, Sureware
Engine, and UBSEC Engine.
A new PKCS#11 engine has been included with ENGINE name "pkcs11". The engine was developed in Sun and is
not integrated in the OpenSSL project.
The PKCS#11 engine is configured to use the Solaris Cryptographic Framework. See cryptoadm(1M) for configu<hy>
ration information.
The PKCS#11 engine can support the following set of mechanisms: CKM_AES_CBC, CKM_AES_ECB,
CKM_BLOWFISH_CBC, CKM_DES_CBC, CKM_DES_ECB, CKM_DES3_CBC, CKM_DES3_ECB,
CKM_DSA, CKM_MD5, CKM_RC4, CKM_RSA_PKCS, CKM_RSA_X_509, CKM_SHA_1, CKM_SHA224,
CKM_SHA256, CKM_SHA384, and CKM_SHA512.
The set of mechanisms available depends on installed Crypto Framework providers. To see what mechanisms can be
offloaded to the Cryptographic Framework through the PKCS#11 engine on a given machine, run the following
command:
 /usr/sfw/bin/openssl engine -vvv -t -c
Due to requirements of the PKCS#11 standard regarding fork(2) behavior, some applications that use the OpenSSL
EVP interfaces and fork() with active crypto contexts might experience unexpected behavior.
To build an OpenSSL application, use the following cc command line options:
 cc [ flag... ] file... -lcrypto -lssl [ library... ]
Extensive additional documentation for OpenSSL modules is available in the /usr/share/man/man1openssl,
/usr/share/man/man3openssl, /usr/share/man/man5openssl, and /usr/share/man/man7openssl directories.
