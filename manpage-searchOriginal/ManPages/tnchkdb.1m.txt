tnchkdb <-> check file syntax of trusted network databases
/usr/sbin/tnchkdb [-h path] [-t path] [-z path]
tnchkdb checks the syntax of the tnrhtp, tnrhdb, and tnzonecfg databases. By default, the path for each file is: <bu>
/etc/security/tsol/tnrhtp <bu> /etc/security/tsol/tnrhdb <bu> /etc/security/tsol/tnzonecfg
You can specify an alternate path for any or all of the files by specifying that path on the command line by using the
-h (tnrhdb), -t (tnrhtp) and -z (tnzonecfg) options. The options are useful when testing a set of modified files be<hy>
fore installing the files as new system databases.
All three database files are checked for integrity. tnchkdb returns an exit status of 0 if all of the files are syntactical<hy>
ly and, to the extent possible, semantically correct. If one or more files have errors, then an exit status of 1 is re<hy>
turned. If there are command line problems, such as an unreadable file, an exit status of 2 is returned. Errors are
written to standard error.
To avoid cascading errors, when there are errors in tnrhtp, the template names in tnrhdb are not validated.
tnchkdb can be run at any label, but the standard /etc/security/tsol files are visible only in the global zone.
-h [ path ] Check path for proper tnrhdb syntax. If path is not specified, then check /etc/security/tsol/tnrhdb.
-t [ path ] Check path for proper tnrhtp syntax. If path is not specified, then check /etc/security/tsol/tnrhtp.
-z [ path ] Check path for proper tnzonecfg syntax. If path is not specified, then check /etc/security/tsol/tnzonecfg.
Example 1 Sample Error Message
The tnchkdb command checks for CIPSO errors. In this example, the admin_low template has an incorrect value of
ADMIN_HIGH for its default label.
