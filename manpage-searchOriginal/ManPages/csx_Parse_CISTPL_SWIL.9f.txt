int32_t csx_Parse_CISTPL_SWIL(client_handle_t ch, tuple_t *tu,
 cistpl_swil_t *pt);
Solaris DDI Specific (Solaris DDI)
ch Client handle returned from csx_RegisterClient(9F).
tu Pointer to a tuple_t structure (see tuple(9S)) returned by a call to csx_GetFirstTuple(9F) or csx_GetNext<hy>
Tuple(9F).
pt Pointer to a cistpl_swil_t structure which contains the parsed CISTPL_SWIL tuple information upon return
from this function.
This function parses the Software Interleaving tuple, CISTPL_SWIL, into a form usable by PC Card drivers.
The CISTPL_SWIL tuple provides the software interleaving of data within a partition on the card.
The structure members of cistpl_swil_t are:
 uint32_t intrlv;
The fields are defined as follows:
intrlv This field provides the software interleaving for a partition.
CS_SUCCESS Successful operation.
CS_BAD_HANDLE Client handle is invalid.
CS_UNKNOWN_TUPLE Parser does not know how to parse tuple.
CS_NO_CARD No PC Card in socket.
CS_NO_CIS No Card Information Structure (CIS) on PC Card.
CS_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION No PCMCIA hardware installed.
This function may be called from user or kernel context.
