The smbutil command controls the Solaris CIFS client and issues various commands.
The smbutil command supports the following subcommands:
crypt
Creates a hash of a password. This subcommand prompts for a password and writes the hash to standard output. This
hash value is suitable for use as a value for the password property in the $HOME/.nsmbrc file.
The hashed password begins with two dollar signs ($$). If you assign this hashed password to the password proper<hy>
ty in your $HOME/.nsmbrc, be sure that you escape the special characters in the password.
If you plan to store hashed passwords in your $HOME/.nsmbrc file, ensure that the file permissions are set so that
only the owner can read or write the file (400 or 600), or the passwords are ignored.
login [-c] [ [[domain/]user] | [user[@domain] ]
Specifies persistent password information to be used for a CIFS server user account. When you specify this informa<hy>
tion, mounts can be done without a password prompt in non-Kerberos configurations. Kerberos sites should use Ker<hy>
beros automatically, not prompt for a password. If a default domain is available in SMF or nsmbrc(4), the domain
can be omitted. If a user name is not specified, the Solaris user account name is used.
Use the -c to check whether a persistent password is set for the specified user.
Passwords can also be stored for a specific server by using a server name in place of the domain name. This capabili<hy>
ty is useful with servers that are configured for "workgroup mode."
logout [ [[domain/]user] | [user[@domain] ]
Erases the persistent passwords for the user running the command.
The user name and domain name portions of the name are optional. If these names are not specified, the user name
and domain name values are taken from the properties set in your environment. See the nsmbrc(4) manual page.
If you stored your password for a specific server, specify the server name in place of the domain name.
logout -a
Erases all of the persistent passwords that are stored for the user who is running the command.
<beginning of page>
logoutall
Erases all the persistent passwords that are stored by all users running the smbutil login command.
This command must be run as superuser.
lookup name
Resolves the specified name to an IP address.
This subcommand is only supported if an NBNS/WINS name server is available.
status server
Resolves the specified server to the NetBIOS domain and system name. server can be an IP address or a DNS name.
view [-A | -U user] //[domain;][user[:password]@]server
Lists the resources available to user on the specified server.
You can specify the -A option to view the resources as an anonymous user or the -U user option to view the re<hy>
sources as the specified user. These options are mutually exclusive.
If the resource includes a domain, you must escape the semicolon that appears after the domain name to prevent it
from being interpreted by the command shell. For instance, surround the entire resource name with single quotes:
smbutil view '//SALES;george@RSERVER'.
The following global options are supported:
-d Produces debugging output.
-v Produces verbose output.
-? Prints a short help message.
Example 1 Creating a Password Hash for the $HOME/.nsmbrc File
The following example shows how to use the smbutil crypt command to create a hash of the password you specify.
Then, you can use the hash as the value for the $HOME/.nsmbrc file.
Be sure to escape the two dollar-sign prefix of the hashed password if you store it as a value of the password proper<hy>
ty.
 $ smbutil crypt
 Password:
 $$178465324253e0c07
The following $HOME/.nsmbrc file fragment shows how the password hash value is set:
 [RSERVER:george]
 charsets=koi8-r:cp866
 password='$$178465324253e0c07'
Example 2 Storing a Password for a CIFS Server
The following example shows how to use the smbutil login command to store the root@example user's password.
<beginning of page>
 $ smbutil login root@example
 Password:
Example 3 Erasing the Stored Password
The following example shows how to use the smbutil logout command to remove the root@example user's pass<hy>
word.
 $ smbutil logout root@example
Example 4 Viewing Available Shares
The following example shows how to use the smbutil view command to see the available shares for user root on
server example.
 $ smbutil view //root@example
 Password:

Example 5 Viewing Available Shares as an Anonymous User
The following example shows how to use the smbutil view command to anonymously view the available shares on
the example server.
 $ smbutil view -A //example

Example 6 Obtaining the IP Address From a Server Name
The following example shows how to use the smbutil lookup command to obtain the IP address of the example
server.
 $ smbutil lookup example
 Got response from 192.168.168.210
 IP address of example: 192.168.168.210
Example 7 Obtaining the NetBIOS Domain and System Name Using the Server Name
<beginning of page>
The following example shows how to use the smbutil status command to obtain the NetBIOS domain and system
name of the example server. The server name, example, is specified on the command line.
 $ smbutil status example
 Domain: WORKGROUP
 Server: EXAMPLE
Example 8 Obtaining the NetBIOS Domain and System Name Using the IP Address
The following example shows how to use the smbutil status command to obtain the NetBIOS domain and system
name of the example server. The IP address, 192.168.168.210, is specified on the command line.
 $ smbutil status 192.168.168.210
 Domain: WORKGROUP
 Server: EXAMPLE

The Solaris CIFS client always attempts to use gethostbyname() to resolve host names. If the host name cannot be
resolved, the CIFS client uses NetBIOS name resolution (NBNS). By default, the Solaris CIFS client permits the use
of NBNS to enable Solaris CIFS clients in Windows environments to work without additional configuration.
Since NBNS has been exploited in the past, you might want to disable it. To disable NBNS, set the nbns-enabled
service management facility property to false. By default, nbns-enabled is set to true.
