dircmp <-> directory comparison
dircmp [-ds] [-w n] dir1 dir2
The dircmp command examines dir1 and dir2 and generates various tabulated information about the contents of the
directories. Listings of files that are unique to each directory are generated for all the options. If no option is entered,
a list is output indicating whether the file names common to both directories have the same contents.
The following options are supported:
-d Compares the contents of files with the same name in both directories and output a list telling what must be
changed in the two files to bring them into agreement. The list format is described in diff(1).
-s Suppresses messages about identical files.
-w n Changes the width of the output line to n characters. The default width is 72.
The following operands are supported:
dir1
dir2 A path name of a directory to be compared.
See largefile(5) for the description of the behavior of dircmp when encountering files greater than or equal to 2
Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes).
See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the execution of dircmp:
LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred. (Differences in directory contents are not considered errors.)
