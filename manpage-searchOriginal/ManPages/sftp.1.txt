The sftp utility is an interactive file transfer program with a user interface similar to ftp(1) that uses the ssh(1) com<hy>
mand to create a secure connection to the server.
sftp implements the SSH File Transfer Protocol as defined in IETF draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer. There is no relationship
between the protocol used by sftp and the FTP protocol (RFC 959) provided by ftp(1).
The first usage format causes sftp to connect to the specified host and enter an interactive mode. If a username was
provided then sftp tries to log in as the specified user. If a directory is provided then sftp tries to change the current
directory on the server to the specified directory before entering the interactive mode.
The second usage format retrieves the specified file from the server and copies it to the specified target file or direc<hy>
tory on the client. If a username is specified sftp tries to log in as the specified user.
The following options are supported:
-b batchfile Batch mode reads a series of commands from an input batchfile instead of stdin. Since it lacks user in<hy>
teraction, it should be used in conjunction with non-interactive authentication. A batchfile of - can be used to indi<hy>
cate standard input. sftp aborts if any of the following commands fail: get, put, rm, rename, ln, rm, mkdir, chdir,
ls, lchdir, chmod, chown, chgrp, lpwd, and lmkdir. Termination on error can be suppressed on a command by
command basis by prefixing the command with a - character (for example, -rm /tmp/blah*).
-B buffer_size Specifies the size of the buffer that sftp uses when transferring files. Larger buffers require fewer
round trips at the cost of higher memory consumption. The default is 32768 bytes.
-C Enables compression, using the -C flag in ssh(1).
-F ssh_config Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for ssh. This option is directly passed to ssh(1).
-o ssh_option Specifies an option to be directly passed to ssh(1).
-P sftp_server path Executes the specified path as an sftp-server and uses a pipe, rather than an ssh connection, to
communicate with it. This option can be useful in debugging the sftp client and server. The -P and -S options are
mutually exclusive.
-R num_requests Specifies how many requests can be outstanding at any one time. Increasing this can slightly im<hy>
prove file transfer speed but increases memory usage. The default is 16 outstanding requests.
-s subsystem | sftp_server Specifies the SSH2 subsystem or the path for an sftp server on the remote host. A path is
useful for using sftp over protocol version 1, or when the remote sshd does not have an sftp subsystem configured.
-S ssh_program path Uses the specified program instead of ssh(1) to connect to the sftp server. The -P and -S op<hy>
tions are mutually exclusive. The program must understand ssh(1) options.
-v Raises logging level. This option is also passed to ssh(1).
<beginning of page>
-1 Specifies the use of protocol version 1.
The following operands are supported:
hostname | user@hostname The name of the host to which sftp connects and logs into.
Once in interactive mode, sftp understands a set of commands similar to those of ftp(1). Commands are case insen<hy>
sitive and path names can be enclosed in quotes if they contain spaces.
bye
Quits sftp.
cd path
Changes remote directory to path.
chgrp grp path
Changes group of file path to grp. grp must be a numeric GID.
chmod mode path
Changes permissions of file path to mode.
chown own path
Changes owner of file path to own. own must be a numeric UID.
exit
Quits sftp.
get [flags] remote-path [local-path]
Retrieves the remote-path and stores it on the local machine. If the local path name is not specified, it is specified the
same name it has on the remote machine. If the -P flag is specified, then the file's full permission and access time are
copied too.
help
Displays help text.
Identical to the ? command.
lcd path
Changes local directory to path.
lls [ls-options [path]]
Displays local directory listing of either path or current directory if path is not specified.
lmkdir path
Creates local directory specified by path.
<beginning of page>
ln oldpath newpath
Creates a link from oldpath to newpath.
lpwd
Prints local working directory.
ls [-1aflnrSt] [path]
Displays remote directory listing of either path or current directory if path is not specified. path can contain wild<hy>
cards.
The ls supports the following options:
-a Lists files beginning with a dot (.).
-f Does not sort the listing. The default sort order is lexicographical.
-l Displays additional details including permissions and ownership information.
-n Produces a long listing with user and group information presented numerically.
-r Reverses the sort order of the listing.
-S Sorts the listing by file size.
-t Sorts the listing by last modification time.
-1 Produces single column output.
lumask umask
Sets local umask to umask.
mkdir path
Creates remote directory specified by path.
put [flags] local-path [local-path]
Uploads local-path and stores it on the remote machine. If the remote path name is not specified, it is specified the
same name it has on the local machine. If the -P flag is specified, then the file's full permission and access time are
copied too.
pwd
Displays remote working directory.
quit
Quits sftp.
<beginning of page>
rename oldpath newpath
Renames remote file from oldpath to newpath.
rm path
Deletes remote file specified by path.
rmdir path
Removes remote directory specified by path.
symlink oldpath newpath
Creates a symbolic link from oldpath to newpath.
version
Displays the sftp protocol version.
# [comment]
Include a comment. This is useful in batch files.
! [command]
If command is not specified, escapes to the local shell.
If command is specified, executes command in the local shell.
?
Displays help text.
Identical to the help command.
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful completion.
>0 An error occurred.
