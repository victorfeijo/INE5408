updatehome <-> update the home directory copy and link files for the current label
/usr/bin/updatehome [-cirs]
updatehome reads the user's minimum-label copy and link-control files (.copy_files and .link_files). These files
contain a list of files to be copied and symbolically linked from the user's minimum-label home directory to the us<hy>
er's home directory at the current label.
The Solaris Trusted Extensions dtsession program performs an updatehome whenever a newly labeled workspace
is created so that the user's favorite files are available for use. For example, the user probably wants a symbolic link
to such files as .profile, .login, .cshrc, .exrc, .mailrc, and ~/bin. The updatehome command provides a convenient
mechanism for accomplishing this symlink. The user can add files to those to be copied (.copy_files) and to those to
be symbolically linked (.link_files).
-c Replace existing home-directory copies at the current label. The default is to skip over existing copies.
-i Ignore errors encountered. The default aborts on error.
-r Replace existing home-directory copies or symbolic links at the current label. This option implies options -c and
-s. The default is to skip over existing copies or symbolic links.
-s Replace existing home-directory symbolic links at the current label. The default is to skip over existing symbolic
links.
Upon success, updatehome returns 0. Upon failure, updatehome returns 1 and writes diagnostic messages to stan<hy>
dard error. Example 1 A Sample .copy_files File
The files that are listed in .copy_files can be modified at every user's label.
 .cshrc
 .mailrc
 .mozilla/bookmarks.html
Example 2 A Sample .link_files File
The files that are listed in .link_files can be modified at the lowest label. The changes propagate to the other labels
that are available to the user.
 ~/bin
 .mozilla/preferences
 .xrc
 .rhosts
Example 3 Updating the Linked and Copied Files
The .copy_files and .link_files were updated by the user at the minimum label. At a higher label, the user refreshes
the copies and the links. No privileges are required to run the command.
