lastcomm <-> display the last commands executed, in reverse order
lastcomm [-f file] [-x] [command-name] ... [user-name] ...
 [terminal-name] ...
The lastcomm command gives information on previously executed commands. lastcomm with no arguments dis<hy>
plays information about all the commands recorded during the current accounting file's lifetime. If called with argu<hy>
ments, lastcomm only displays accounting entries with a matching command-name, user-name, or terminal-name. If
extended process accounting is active (see acctadm(1M)) and is recording the appropriate data items, lastcomm at<hy>
tempts to take data from the current extended process accounting file. If standard process accounting is active, last<hy>
comm takes data from the current standard accounting file (see acct(2)).
If terminal-name is `- -', there was no controlling TTY for the process. The process was probably executed during
boot time. If terminal-name is `??', the controlling TTY could not be decoded into a printable name.
For each process entry, lastcomm displays the following items of information: <bu> The command name under which
the process was called. <bu> One or more flags indicating special information about the process. The flags have the fol<hy>
lowing meanings:
F The process performed a fork but not an exec.
S The process ran as a set-user-id program.
<bu> The name of the user who ran the process. <bu> The terminal which the user was logged in on at the time (if applica<hy>
ble). <bu> The amount of CPU time used by the process (in seconds). <bu> The date and time the process exited.
The following options are supported:
-f file Uses file as the source of accounting data. file may be either an extended process accounting file or a standard
process accounting file.
-x Uses the currently active extended process accounting file. If extended processing accounting is inactive, no out<hy>
put will be produced.
Example 1 Listing executions of named commands
The command
 example% lastcomm a.out root term/01
produces a listing of all the executions of commands named a.out by user root while using the terminal term/01.
Example 2 Listing all user commands
The command
 example% lastcomm root
produces a listing of all the commands executed by user root.
