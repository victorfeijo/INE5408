csx_ValidateCIS <-> validate the Card Information Structure (CIS)
#include <sys/pccard.h>
int32_t csx_ValidateCIS(client_handle_t ch, cisinfo_t *ci);
Solaris DDI Specific (Solaris DDI)
ch Client handle returned from csx_RegisterClient(9F).
ci Pointer to a cisinfo_t structure.
This function validates the Card Information Structure (CIS) on the PC Card in the specified socket.
The structure members of cisinfo_t are:
  uint32_t Socket; /* socket number to validate CIS on */
  uint32_t Chains; /* number of tuple chains in CIS */
  uint32_t Tuples; /* total number of tuples in CIS */
The fields are defined as follows:
Socket Not used in Solaris, but for portability with other Card Services implementations, it should be set to the logi<hy>
cal socket number.
Chains This field returns the number of valid tuple chains located in the CIS. If 0 is returned, the CIS is not valid.
Tuples This field is a Solaris-specific extension and it returns the total number of tuples on all the chains in the PC
Card's CIS.
CS_SUCCESS Successful operation.
CS_NO_CIS No CIS on PC Card or CIS is invalid.
CS_NO_CARD No PC Card in socket.
CS_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION No PCMCIA hardware installed.
This function may be called from user or kernel context.
