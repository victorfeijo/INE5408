modload <-> load a kernel module
modload [-p] [-e exec_file] filename
The modload command loads the loadable module filename into the running system.
filename is an object file produced by ld -r. If filename is an absolute pathname then the file specified by that abso<hy>
lute path is loaded. If filename does not begin with a slash (/), then the path to load filename is relative to the cur<hy>
rent directory unless the -p option is specified.
The kernel's modpath variable can be set using the /etc/system file. The default value of the kernel's modpath vari<hy>
able is set to the path where the operating system was loaded. Typically this is /kernel /usr/kernel.
For example, the following command looks for ./drv/foo:
 example# modload drv/foo
The following command looks for /kernel/drv/foo and then /usr/kernel/drv/foo:
 example# modload -p drv/foo
The following options are supported:
-e exec_file Specify the name of a shell script or executable image file that is executed after the module is success<hy>
fully loaded. The first argument passed is the module ID (in decimal). The other argument is module specific. The
module specific information is: the block and character major numbers for drivers, the system call number for sys<hy>
tem calls, or, for other module types, the index into the appropriate kernel table. See modinfo(1M)
-p Use the kernel's internal modpath variable as the search path for the module.
