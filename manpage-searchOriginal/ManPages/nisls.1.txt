nisls <-> list the contents of a NIS+ directory
nisls [-dglLmMR] [name]...
For each name that is a NIS+ directory, nisls lists the contents of the directory. For each name that is a NIS+ object
other than a directory, nisls simply echos the name. If no name is specified, the first directory in the search path is
listed. See nisdefaults(1).
The following options are supported:
-d Treat NIS+ directories like other NIS+ objects, rather than listing their contents.
-g Display group owner instead of owner when listing in long format.
-l List in long format. This option displays additional information about the objects such as their type, creation time,
owner, and access rights.
The access rights are listed in the following order in long mode: nobody, owner, group owner, and world.
-L This option specifies that links are to be followed. If name actually points to a link, it is followed to the linked ob<hy>
ject.
-m Display modification time instead of creation time when listing in long format.
-M Master only. This specifies that information is to be returned from the master server of the named object. This
guarantees that the most up to date information is seen at the possible expense that the master server may be busy.
-R List directories recursively. This option will reiterate the list for each subdirectory found in the process of listing
each name.
NIS_PATH If this variable is set, and the NIS+ name is not fully qualified, each directory specified will be searched
until the object is found. See nisdefaults(1).
The following exit values are returned:
0 Successful operation.
1 Operation failed.

NIS+ might not be supported in future releases of the Solaris operating system. Tools to aid the migration from
NIS+ to LDAP are available in the current Solaris release. For more information, visit http://www.sun.com/directo<hy>
