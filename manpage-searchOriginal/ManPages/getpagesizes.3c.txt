getpagesizes <-> get system supported page sizes
#include <sys/mman.h>
int getpagesizes(size_t pagesize[], int nelem);
The getpagesizes() function returns either the number of different page sizes supported by the system or the actual
sizes themselves. When called with nelem as 0 and pagesize as NULL, getpagesizes() returns the number of sup<hy>
ported page sizes. Otherwise, up to nelem page sizes are retrieved and assigned to successive elements of pa<hy>
gesize[]. The return value is the number of page sizes retrieved and set in pagesize[].
Upon successful completion, the number of pagesizes supported or actually retrieved is returned. Otherwise, <mi>1 is
returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
The getpagesizes() function will fail if:
EINVAL The nelem argument is less than 0 or pagesize is NULL but nelem is non-zero.
The getpagesizes() function returns all the page sizes for which the hardware and system software provide support
for the memcntl(2) command MC_HAT_ADVISE. Not all processors support all page sizes or combinations of
page sizes with equal efficiency. Applications programmers should take this into consideration when using getpage<hy>
sizes().
