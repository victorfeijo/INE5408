The fbconf_xorg utility configures Frame Buffer devices and some of the X11 window system defaults for Xorg by
updating the xorg.conf configuration file.
The first fbconf_xorg command form shown in the SYNOPSIS section stores the specified option values in the
xorg.conf configuration file. These settings are used to initialize the frame buffer device the next time the window
system is run on that device. The persistence of these settings across window system sessions and system reboots is
determined by the xorg.conf file.
The second and third command forms display information, and do not alter the xorg.conf file. The presence of the
-help and/or -res ? options will cause any other option (not shown in the third form) to be ignored.
You can configure only one frame buffer device at a time. To configure multiple devices, invoke the fbconf_xorg
utility separately for each device.
Only frame buffer device options can be specified with fbconf_xorg. Use the normal window system options to
specify default depth (see svccfg(1M)), default visual class, and so forth. Specify these as device modifiers on the
command line. See Xserver(1), part of the OpenWindows, not the SunOS, man page collection.
You can specify which xorg.conf file to open. By default, fbconf_xorg opens the machine-specific file,
/etc/X11/xorg.conf. Use the -file option to specify an alternate file. For example, the system-global file,
/usr/X11/xorg.conf, can be opened instead.
These standard xorg.conf files can be written only by the superuser or someone with the Primary Administrator role.
Consequently, the fbconf_xorg program is run with setuid root permission.
The following options are supported for all frame buffer devices:
-defaults
Sets configuration options for the specified device to their default values. This does not affect the -res video mode
setting. See the device-specific portions of the DEFAULTS section below.
-dev device-file
Specifies the frame buffer device by either its full pathname or simple filename (for example, /dev/fbs/kfb0 or
kfb0). Pathnames of installed devices can be displayed using the -list option to fbconfig(1M). If the -dev option is
omitted, the default device, /dev/fb, is used.
<beginning of page>
-file machine | system | config-path
Specifies which xorg.conf file to open. If machine is specified, the machine-specific /etc/X11/xorg.conf file is
opened. If system is specified, the global /usr/X11/xorg.conf file is opened. The absolute pathname of a configura<hy>
tion file can be used instead. If the specified file does not exist and is to be updated, it will be created. The file sys<hy>
tem that will contain the xorg.conf file must be writeable by someone with superuser-like privileges. This option has
no effect unless other options are specified. The default is machine.
-help
Display the fbconf_xorg command line options that are supported in conjunction with the frame buffer device,
along with a brief explanation of each option. The frame buffer device can be specified using the -dev option.
-prconf
Display the current configuration for the frame buffer device and attached display device(s). The frame buffer device
can be specified using the -dev option.
The -prconf output might resemble:

-res video-mode [nocheck | noconfirm]
Set the video mode for the display device that is connected to the frame buffer device.
A list of video modes can be displayed using the -res ? option.
The basic format of a video-mode is widthxheightxrate, where: <bu> width is the screen width in pixels. <bu> height is the
screen height in pixels. <bu> rate is the vertical frequency of the screen refresh. A video-mode argument may have an
@ (at sign) instead of x preceding the refresh rate. For instance, 1280x1024x76 and 1280x1024@76 are equivalent.
A video-mode name may carry additional information, as with SUNW_STD_1280x1024x76.
The -res argument, auto, represents the video mode that is currently programmed into the device. The argument,
none, is a synonym for auto.
Note that some video modes might be inappropriate for certain frame buffer devices and/or display devices.
The -res option accepts suboption keywords following the video-mode specification.
nocheck
The nocheck suboption causes the video-mode argument to be accepted, regardless of whether it is supported by the
currently attached monitor, whether it is known within the current configuration, and so forth. Note that using an
unchecked, inappropriate video mode can leave the system without usable video output. This suboption is useful if a
different monitor is to be connected to the frame buffer device. This suboption also implies noconfirm.
noconfirm
If the video-mode argument is unable to be validated, the default action is to display a warning message and ask the
user whether to continue. The noconfirm suboption suppresses this confirmation request. This suboption is useful
when fbconf_xorg is being run from a shell script.
The following device-specific options are supported for certain frame buffer devices. Unless specified otherwise,
these options do not take effect until the user logs out and back in.
-deflinear true | false
This option selects the default X visual. Two types of visuals are supported, linear and nonlinear. Linear visuals are
gamma corrected. Nonlinear visuals are not.
If the value of this option is true, the default visual is set to default depth 24 and the default class is TrueColor with
gamma correction enabled. If false, a nonlinear visual that satisfies the other default visual selection options, such as
the default depth and default class, is chosen as the default visual.
The -deflinear, -defoverlay, and -deftransparent options each select the default X visual. Only one of these may be
enabled at a time. Enabling one causes the others to be disabled.
-defoverlay true | false
This option selects the default X visual. The kfb device provides an 8-bit PseudoColor visual whose pixels are dis<hy>
joint from the rest of the visuals. This is called the overlay visual. Windows created in this visual will not damage
windows created in other visuals. The converse, however, is not true: Windows created in other visuals will damage
overlay windows.
If the value of this option is true, the overlay visual is the default visual. The default depth is 8-bit and the default
class is PseudoColor. If false, the non-overlay visual that satisfies the other default visual selection options, such as
the default depth and the default class, is chosen as the default visual.
The -deflinear, -defoverlay, and -deftransparent options each select the default X visual. Only one of these may be
enabled at a time. Enabling one causes the others to be disabled.
-deftransparent true | false
This option selects the default X visual. The kfb device provides an 8-bit PseudoColor visual whose pixels are dis<hy>
<beginning of page>
joint from the rest of the visuals. This is called the overlay visual. Windows created in this visual will not damage
windows created in other visuals.
If the value of this option is true, the overlay visual used as the default is a transparent overlay visual. A visual with
transparency supports a colormap with 255 colors and one transparent pixel. The default depth is 8-bit and the de<hy>
fault class is PseudoColor. If false, the nonoverlay visual that satisfies the other default visual selection options, such
as the default depth and the default class, is chosen as the default visual.
The -deflinear, -defoverlay, and -deftransparent options each select the default X visual. Only one of these may be
enabled at a time. Enabling one causes the others to be disabled.
-doublehigh enable | disable
Configures the two outputs of the frame buffer device into one vertical virtual display. The default is disable. The
-doublewide and -doublehigh options are mutually exclusive. Enabling one causes the other to be disabled.
-doublewide enable | disable
Configures the two outputs of the frame buffer device into one horizontal virtual display. The default is disable. The
-doublewide and -doublehigh options are mutually exclusive. Enabling one causes the other to be disabled.
-g gamma-correction-value
Sets the gamma correction value. All linear visuals provide gamma correction. The gamma correction value should
be in the range, 0.1 to 10.0. The default is 2.22. This option can be used while the window system is running.
Changing the gamma correction value affects all of the windows displayed by linear visuals.
-gfile gamma-correction-file
Loads the gamma correction table from the file specified by gamma-correction-file. This text file specifies the gam<hy>
ma correction values for the R, G, and B channels. Three consecutive values form an RGB triplet. For a kfb device,
there must be exactly 256 RGB triplets. A value may be represented in hexadecimal, decimal, or octal format (for
example, 0x3FF, 1023, or 01777, respectively). Values are separated by one or more whitespace or new line charac<hy>
ters. Comments begin with a hash sign character (#) and end at the end of the line.
You can load the gamma correction table with this option while the window system is running. The new gamma cor<hy>
rection affects all the windows being displayed using the linear visuals. When gamma correction is done using a
user-specified table, the gamma correction value (-g) is undefined. By default, the window system assumes a gamma
correction value of 2.22 and loads the gamma table it creates corresponding to this value.
The following is an example of a gamma-correction-file file:
  # Gamma Correction Table
  0x00 0x00 0x00
  0x01 0x01 0x01
  0x02 0x02 0x02
  ... ... ...
  ... ... ...
  0xFF 0xFF 0xFF
-multisample available | disable | forceon
If set to disable, no multisample is possible. If set to available, multisample is possible but is selected on a per-win<hy>
dow basis using a library interface. If set to forceon, all Sun OpenGL windows are rendered using multisampling. To
query the number of samples used, specify the -propt option or run the xglinfo utility. The xglinfo utility can return
the number of multisamples if -multisample is set to available. The default is disable. xglinfo is described in the
xglinfo(1) man page, in the Sun OpenGL man page collection.
-offset x-val y-val
Adjusts the position of the specified stream by the value specified. This option is only implemented in -doublewide
<beginning of page>
and -doublehigh modes. For -doublewide, use the x-val to position the rightmost stream. Negative is left (overlaps
with the left stream). For -doublehigh, use the y-val to position the bottom stream. Negative is up (overlaps with top
stream). The default is [0,0].
-samples 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16
Requests the number of samples to compute per display pixel. The requested number of samples per pixel is used if
-multisample is not disabled and resources exist for the request. To query the number of samples used, specify the
-propt option or run the xglinfo utility. The xglinfo utility can return the number of multisamples after you specify
the option -multisample available. The default is 4.
-slave disable | multiview
If you set the multiview argument for the -slave option, the device synchronizes video with a master through the
multiview genlock ribbon cable. The system should be powered off whenever connecting or disconnecting this ca<hy>
ble. Both devices should be running the same resolution and the option should be issued when the window system is
running. The default is disable.
Certain options have implied default arguments. The default argument is used when the option is not present on the
fbconf_xorg command line. For instance, a default argument for -dev is /dev/fb.
Options that set configuration state do not have implied defaults. The -res option is one example. If a configuration
option is omitted from the fbconf_xorg command line, the corresponding xorg.conf configuration setting will re<hy>
main unchanged. The exception is that if configuration options are mutually exclusive, setting one will automatically
unset each of the others. An example is -deflinear, -defoverlay, and -deftransparent.
If a configuration setting is not present in the configura tion file when the window system is run, a default value will
be used. For instance, the default state associated with -res is auto. A setting might not be present in the file, or the
file itself might not exist, until fbconf_xorg has been invoked with the corresponding command line option.
The -defaults option sets the default values for most configuration settings.
Options and their defaults are shown below.
Device-independent defaults:
  Option Default Argument
  -dev /dev/fb
  -file machine
  Option Default State
  -res auto
kfb-specific defaults:
