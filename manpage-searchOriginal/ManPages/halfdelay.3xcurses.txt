int halfdelay(int tenths);
The halfdelay() function is similar to cbreak(3XCURSES) in that when set, characters typed by the user are imme<hy>
diately processed by the program. The difference is that ERR is returned if no input is received after tenths tenths
seconds.
The nocbreak(3XCURSES) function should be used to leave half-delay mode.
tenths Is the number of tenths of seconds for which to block input (1 to 255).
On success, the halfdelay() function returns OK. Otherwise, it returns ERR.
None.
