datadm <-> maintain DAT static registry file
/usr/bin/datadm [-v] [-u] [-a service_provider.conf]
 [-r service_provider.conf]
The datadm utility maintains the DAT static registry file, dat.conf(4).
This administrative configuration program allows uDAPL service providers to add and remove themselves to the
dat.conf file.
You can add or remove interface adapters that a service provider supports from a system after its installation. You
can use datadm to update the dat.conf file to reflect the current state of the system. A new set of interface adapters
for all the service providers currently installed is regenerated.
The following options are supported:
-a service_provider.conf Enumerate each device entry in the service_provider.conf(4) file into a list of interface
adapters, that is, interfaces to external network that are available to uDAPL consumers.
-r service_provider.conf Remove the list of interface adapters that corresponds to the device entry in the ser<hy>
vice_provider.conf(4) file.
-u Update the dat.conf to reflect the current state of the system with an up to date set of interface adapters for the
service providers that are currently listed in the DAT static registry.
-v Display the DAT static registry file, dat.conf.
Example 1 Enumerating a Device Entry
The following example enumerates a device entry in the service_provider.conf(4) file into interface adapters in the
dat.conf(4) file.
Assume that SUNW has a service provider library that supports the device tavor. It has a service_provider.conf(4)
file installed in the directory /usr/share/dat/SUNWudaplt.conf with a single entry as follows:
 driver_name=tavor u1.2 nonthreadsafe default\
  udapl_tavor.so.1 SUNW.1.0 ""
tavor is an Infiniband Host Channel Adapter with two ports. Both IB ports exist in a single IB partition, 0x8001. If
an IP interface is plumbed to each port, there are two IPoIB device instances, ibd0 and ibd1:
 # ls -l /dev/ibd*
 /dev/ibd0 -> /devices/pci@1/pci15b3,5a44@0/ibport@1,8001,ipib:ibd0
 /dev/ibd1 -> /devices/pci@1/pci15b3,5a44@0/ibport@2,8001,ipib:ibd1
Running the command, datadm -a /usr/share/dat/SUNWudaplt.conf appends two new entries (if they do not al<hy>
ready exists]) in the /etc/dat/dat.conffile:
 ibd0 u1.2 nonthreadsafe default udapl_tavor.so.1 SUNW.1.0 ""
 "driver_name=tavor"
 ibd1 u1.2 nonthreadsafe default udapl_tavor.so.1 SUNW.1.0 ""
 "driver_name=tavor"
Example 2 Updating the dat.conf to Reflect the Current State of the System
<beginning of page>
A new IB partition, 0x8002 is added to the above example covering port 1 of the Host Channel Adapter. If a new IP
interface is plumbed to port 1/partition 0x8002, there is a third IPoIB device instance: ibd2.
 # ls -l /dev/ibd*
  /dev/ibd0 -> /devices/pci@1/pci15b3,5a44@0/ibport@1,8001,ipib:ibd0
  /dev/ibd1 -> /devices/pci@1/pci15b3,5a44@0/ibport@2,8001,ipib:ibd1
  /dev/ibd2 -> /devices/pci@1/pci15b3,5a44@0/ibport@1,8002,ipib:ibd2
Running datadm -u command, updates the /etc/dat/dat.conf file with a new entry added reflecting the current state
of the system.
datadm -v shows that there are now three entries in the /etc/dat/dat.conf file:
 ibd0 u1.2 nonthreadsafe default udapl_tavor.so.1 SUNW.1.0 ""
 "driver_name=tavor"
 ibd1 u1.2 nonthreadsafe default udapl_tavor.so.1 SUNW.1.0 ""
 "driver_name=tavor"
 ibd2 u1.2 nonthreadsafe default udapl_tavor.so.1 SUNW.1.0 ""
 "driver_name=tavor"
