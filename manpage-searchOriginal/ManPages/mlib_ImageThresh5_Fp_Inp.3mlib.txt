mlib_status mlib_ImageThresh5_Fp_Inp(mlib_image *srcdst,
 const mlib_d64 *thigh, const mlib_d64 *tlow, const mlib_d64 *gray);
The mlib_ImageThresh5_Fp_Inp() function compares each pixel in the source image to two threshold values, tlow
and thigh. If the pixel is in between the lower threshold value, tlow, and the higher threshold value, thigh, (inclusive
on both sides), then the destination pixel is set to the value gray. Otherwise, the destination pixel is set to the value
of the source pixel.
It uses the following equation:
 srcdst[x][y][i] = gray[i] if tlow[i] <<=> srcdst[x][y][i] <<=> thigh[i]
The function takes the following arguments:
srcdst Pointer to source and destination image.
thigh High threshold value. thigh[i] holds the high threshold for channel i.
tlow Low threshold value. tlow[i] holds the low threshold for channel i.
gray Output grayscale level. gray[i] holds the output grayscale level for channel i.
The function returns MLIB_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise it returns MLIB_FAILURE.
