iwh <-> Intel(R) WiFi Link 5100/5300 Driver
The iwh 802.11a/g/n wireless NIC driver is a multi-threaded, loadable, clonable, GLDv3-based STREAMS driver
supporting the Intel Shirley Peak WiFi chipset-based NIC's. Driver functions include controller initialization, wire<hy>
less 802.11 infrastructure network connection, WEP and frame transmit and receive.
The iwh driver performs auto-negotiation to determine the data rate and mode. Supported 802.11b data rates are 1,
2, 5.5 and 11 Mbits/sec. Supported 802.11g data rates are 1, 2, 5.5, 11, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 54 Mbits/sec.
