scsi_free_consistent_buf <-> free a previously allocated SCSI DMA I/O buffer
#include <sys/scsi/scsi.h>
void scsi_free_consistent_buf(struct buf *bp);
Solaris DDI specific (Solaris DDI).
bp Pointer to the buf(9S) structure.
The scsi_free_consistent_buf() function frees a buffer header and consistent data buffer that was previously allocat<hy>
ed using scsi_alloc_consistent_buf(9F).
The scsi_free_consistent_buf() function can be called from user, interrupt, or kernel context.
freerbuf(9F), scsi_alloc_consistent_buf(9F), buf(9S)
Writing Device Drivers
The scsi_free_consistent_buf() function will call freerbuf(9F) to free the buf(9S) that was allocated before or dur<hy>
ing the call to scsi_alloc_consistent_buf(9F).
If consistent memory is bound to a scsi_pkt(9S), the pkt should be destroyed before freeing the consistent memory.
