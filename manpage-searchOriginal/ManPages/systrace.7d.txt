systrace <-> DTrace system call tracing provider
The systrace driver implements the DTrace syscall dynamic tracing provider. The syscall provider performs dynam<hy>
ic instrumentation to offer probes that fire whenever a thread enters or returns from a kernel system call entry point.
The systrace driver is not a public interface and you access the instrumentation offered by this provider through
DTrace. Refer to the Solaris Dynamic Tracing Guide for a description of the public documented interfaces available
for the DTrace facility and the probes offered by the syscall provider.
