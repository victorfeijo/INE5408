mount_smbfs, umount_smbfs <-> mount and unmount a shared resource from a CIFS file server
/sbin/mount [-F smbfs] [generic-options] [-o name=value] [-O] resource
/sbin/mount [-F smbfs] [generic-options] [-o name=value] [-O] mount-point
/sbin/mount [-F smbfs] [generic-options] [-o name=value]
 [-O] resource mount-point
/sbin/umount [-F smbfs] [generic-options] mount-point
The mount utility attaches a named resource, resource, to the file system hierarchy at the path name location,
mount-point, which must already exist.
If mount-point has any contents prior to the mount operation, those contents remain hidden until the resource is un<hy>
mounted. An authorized user with the SYS_MOUNT privilege can perform a mount operation. Also, a user can
perform SMBFS mount operations on a directory the user owns.
If the resource is listed in the /etc/vfstab file, you can specify either resource or mount-point as the mount command
will consult the /etc/vfstab file for more information. If the -F option is omitted, mount takes the file system type
from the entry in the /etc/vfstab file.
If the resource is not listed in the /etc/vfstab file, the command line must specify both resource and mount-point.
The umount utility detaches a mounted file system from the file system hierarchy. An authorized user with the
SYS_MOUNT privilege can perform a umount operation. Also, a user can perform SMBFS unmount operations on
a directory the user owns.
The network/smb/client service must be enabled to successfully mount a CIFS share. This service is enabled, by
default.
To enable the service, enter the following svcadm(1M) command:
 # svcadm enable network/smb/client
The mount command supports the following operands:
resource //[workgroup;][user[:password]@]server/share
The name of the resource to be mounted. In addition to its name, you can specify the following information about
the resource: <bu> password is the password associated with user. If password is not specified, the mount first attempts
to use the password stored by the smbutil login command (if any). If that password fails to authenticate, the
mount_smbfs prompts you for a password. <bu> server is the DNS or NetBIOS name of the remote computer. <bu> share
is the resource name on the remote server. <bu> user is the remote user name. If user is omitted, the logged in user ID is
used. <bu> workgroup is the name of the workgroup or the Windows domain in which the user name is defined.
If the resource includes a workgroup, you must escape the semicolon that appears after the workgroup name to pre<hy>
vent it from being interpreted by the command shell. For instance, surround the entire resource name with double
quotes: mount -F smbfs "//SALES;george@RSERVER" /mnt.
mount-point
The path to the location where the file system is to be mounted or unmounted. The mount command maintains a ta<hy>
ble of mounted file systems in the /etc/mnttab file. See the mnttab(4) man page.
See the mount(1M) man page for the list of supported generic-options.
-o name=value or
-o name
Sets the file system-specific properties. You can specify more than one name-value pair as a list of comma-separated
pairs. No spaces are permitted in the list. The properties are as follows:
<beginning of page>
dirperms=octaltriplet
Specifies the permissions to be assigned to directories. The value must be specified as an octal triplet, such as 755.
The default value for the directory mode is taken from the fileperms setting, with execute permission added where
fileperms has read permission.
Note that these permissions have no relation to the rights granted by the CIFS server.
fileperms=octaltriplet
Specifies the permissions to be assigned to files. The value must be specified as an octal triplet, such as 644. The de<hy>
fault value is 700.
Note that these permissions have no relation to the rights granted by the CIFS server.
gid=groupid
Assigns the specified group ID to files. The default value is the group ID of the directory where the volume is
mounted.
intr|nointr
Enable (or disable) cancellation of smbfs(7FS) I/O operations when the user interrupts the calling thread (for exam<hy>
ple, by hitting Ctrl-C while an operation is underway). The default is intr (interruption enabled), so cancellation is
normally allowed.
noprompt
Suppresses the prompting for a password when mounting a share. This property enables you to permit anonymous
access to a share. Anonymous access does not require a password.
The mount operation fails if a password is required, the noprompt property is set, and no password is stored by the
smbutil login command.
retry_count=number
Specifies the number of SMBFS retries to attempt before the connection is marked as broken. By default, 4 attempts
are made.
The retry_count property value set by the mount command overrides the global value set in SMF or the value set in
your .nsmbrc file.
timeout=seconds
Specifies the CIFS request timeout. By default, the timeout is 15 seconds.
The timeout property value set by the mount command overrides the global value set in SMF or the value set in
your .nsmbrc file.
uid=userid
Assigns the specified user ID files. The default value is the owner ID of the directory where the volume is mounted.
xattr|noxattr
Enable (or disable) Solaris Extended Attributes in this mount point. This option defaults to xattr (enabled Extended
Attributes), but note: if the CIFS server does not support CIFS "named streams", smbfs(7FS) forces this option to
noxattr. When a mount has the noxattr option, attempts to use Solaris Extended attributes fail with EINVAL.
<beginning of page>
-O
Overlays mount. Allow the file system to be mounted over an existing mount point, making the underlying file sys<hy>
tem inaccessible. If a mount is attempted on a pre-existing mount point without setting this flag, the mount fails, pro<hy>
ducing the error "device busy."
Example 1 Mounting an SMBFS Share
The following example shows how to mount the /tmp share from the nano server in the SALES workgroup on the
local /mnt mount point. You must supply the password for the root user to successfully perform the mount opera<hy>
tion.
 # mount -F smbfs "//SALES;root@nano.sfbay/tmp" /mnt
 Password:
Example 2 Verifying That an SMBFS File System Is Mounted
The following example shows how to mount the /tmp share from the nano server on the local /mnt mount point.
You must supply the password for the root user to successfully perform the mount operation.
 # mount -F smbfs //root@nano.sfbay/tmp /mnt
 Password:
You can verify that the share is mounted in the following ways: <bu> View the file system entry in the /etc/mnttab file.
 # grep root /etc/mnttab
 //root@nano.sfbay/tmp /mnt smbfs dev=4900000 1177097833
<bu> View the output of the mount command.
 # mount | grep root
 /mnt on //root@nano.sfbay/tmp read/write/setuid/devices/dev=4900000 on
 Fri Apr 20 13:37:13 2007
<bu> View the output of the df /mnt command.
 # df /mnt
 /mnt (//root@nano.sfbay/tmp): 3635872 blocks -1 files
Obtain information about the mounted share by viewing the output of the df -k /mnt command.
 # df -k /mnt

 //root@nano.sfbay/tmp
  1882384 64448 1817936 4% /mnt
Example 3 Unmounting a CIFS Share
This example assumes that a CIFS share has been mounted on the /mnt mount point. The following command line
unmounts the share from the mount point.
 # umount /mnt

/etc/mnttab

The Solaris CIFS client always attempts to use gethostbyname() to resolve host names. If the host name cannot be
resolved, the CIFS client uses NetBIOS name resolution (NBNS). By default, the Solaris CIFS client permits the use
of NBNS to enable Solaris CIFS clients in Windows environments to work without additional configuration.
Since NBNS has been exploited in the past, you might want to disable it. To disable NBNS, set the nbns-enabled
service management facility property to false. By default, nbns-enabled is set to true.
If the directory on which a file system is to be mounted is a symbolic link, the file system is mounted on the directo<hy>
ry to which the symbolic link refers, rather than being mounted on top of the symbolic link itself.
