int sasl_auxprop_request(sasl_conn_t *conn, const char **propnames);
The sasl_auxprop_request() interface requests that the SASL library obtain properties form any auxialiary property
plugins that might be installed, for example, the user's home directory from an LDAP server. The lookup occurs just
after username canonicalization is complete. Therefore, the request should be made before the call to sasl_serv<hy>
er_start(3SASL), but after the call to sasl_server_new(3SASL).
conn The sasl_conn_t for which the request is being made
propnames A null-terminated array of property names to request. This array must persist until a call to sasl_dis<hy>
pose(3SASL) on the sasl_conn_t.
sasl_auxprop_request() returns SASL_OK upon success. See sasl_errors(3SASL) for a discussion of other SASL
error codes.
