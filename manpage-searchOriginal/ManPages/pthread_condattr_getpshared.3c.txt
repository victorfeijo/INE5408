 int pshared);
The pthread_condattr_getpshared() function obtains the value of the process-shared attribute from the attributes
object referenced by attr. The pthread_condattr_setpshared() function is used to set the process-shared attribute in
an initialized attributes object referenced by attr.
The process-shared attribute is set to PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED to permit a condition variable to be oper<hy>
ated upon by any thread that has access to the memory where the condition variable is allocated, even if the condi<hy>
tion variable is allocated in memory that is shared by multiple processes. If the process-shared attribute is
PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE, the condition variable will only be operated upon by threads created within the
same process as the thread that initialized the condition variable; if threads of differing processes attempt to operate
on such a condition variable, the behavior is undefined. The default value of the attribute is
PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.
Additional attributes, their default values, and the names of the associated functions to get and set those attribute val<hy>
ues are implementation-dependent.
If successful, the pthread_condattr_setpshared() function returns 0. Otherwise, an error number is returned to in<hy>
dicate the error.
If successful, the pthread_condattr_getpshared() function returns 0 and stores the value of the process-shared at<hy>
tribute of attr into the object referenced by the pshared parameter. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate
the error.
The pthread_condattr_getpshared() and pthread_condattr_setpshared() functions may fail if:
EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.
The pthread_condattr_setpshared() function will fail if:
EINVAL The new value specified for the attribute is outside the range of legal values for that attribute.
