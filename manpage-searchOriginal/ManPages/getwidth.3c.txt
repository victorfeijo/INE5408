void getwidth(eucwidth_t *ptr);
The getwidth() function reads the character class table for the current locale to get information on the supplemen<hy>
tary codesets. getwidth() sets this information into the struct eucwidth_t. This struct is defined in <euc.h> and has
the following members:
 short int _eucw1,_eucw2,_eucw3;
 short int _scrw1,_scrw2,_scrw3;
 short int _pcw;
 char _multibyte;
Codeset width values for supplementary codesets 1, 2, and 3 are set in _eucw1, _eucw2, and _eucw3, respectively.
Screen width values for supplementary codesets 1, 2, and 3 are set in _scrw1, _scrw2, and _scrw3, respectively.
The width of Extended Unix Code (EUC) Process Code is set in _pcw. The _multibyte entry is set to 1 if multibyte
characters are used, and set to 0 if only single-byte characters are used.

The getwidth() function can be used safely in a multithreaded application, as long as setlocale(3C) is not being
called to change the locale.
The getwidth() function will only work with EUC locales.
