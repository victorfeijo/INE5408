groupmod <-> modify a group definition on the system
/usr/sbin/groupmod [-g gid [-o]] [-n name] group
The groupmod command modifies the definition of the specified group by modifying the appropriate entry in the
/etc/group file.
The following options are supported:
-g gid Specify the new group ID for the group. This group ID must be a non-negative decimal integer less than
MAXUID, as defined in <param.h>. The group ID defaults to the next available (unique) number above 99. (Group
IDs from 0-99 are reserved by SunOS for future applications.)
-n name Specify the new name for the group. The name argument is a string of no more than eight bytes consisting
of characters from the set of lower case alphabetic characters and numeric characters. A warning message will be
written if these restrictions are not met. A future Solaris release may refuse to accept group fields that do not meet
these requirements. The name argument must contain at least one character and must not include a colon (:) or
NEWLINE (\n).
-o Allow the gid to be duplicated (non-unique).
The following operands are supported:
group An existing group name to be modified.
The groupmod utility exits with one of the following values:
0 Success.
2 Invalid command syntax. A usage message for the groupmod command is displayed.
3 An invalid argument was provided to an option.
4 gid is not unique (when the -o option is not used).
6 group does not exist.
9 name already exists as a group name.
10 Cannot update the /etc/group file.

The groupmod utility only modifies group definitions in the /etc/group file. If a network name service such as NIS
or NIS+ is being used to supplement the local /etc/group file with additional entries, groupmod cannot change in<hy>
formation supplied by the network name service. The groupmod utility will, however, verify the uniqueness of
group name and group ID against the external name service.
groupmod fails if a group entry (a single line in /etc/group) exceeds 2047 characters.
