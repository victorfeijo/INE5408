ntfslabel <-> display or change the label on an NTFS file system
ntfslabel [options] device [new_label]
The ntfslabel utility displays or changes the file system label on the NTFS file system located on device (see Synop<hy>
sis).
If the optional argument new_label is not present, ntfslabel displays the current file system label.
If the optional argument new_label is present, ntfslabel sets the file system label to be new_label. NTFS file system
labels can be at most 128 Unicode characters long; if new_label is longer than 128 Unicode characters, ntfslabel
truncates it and displays a warning message.
It is also possible to set the file system label using the -L option of mkntfs(1M) during creation of the file system.
Supported options are listed below. Most options have both single-letter and full-name forms. Multiple single-letter
options that do not take an argument can be combined. For example, -fv is the equivalent of -f -v. A full-name option
can be abbreviated to a unique prefix of its name.
-f, --force
Overrides some sensible defaults, such as not working with a mounted volume. Use this option with caution.
-h, --help
Show a list of options with a brief description of each.
-n, --no-action
Do not actually write a new label to disk.
-q, --quiet
Suppress some debug, warning, and error messages.
-V, --version
Show the version number, copyright, and license information.
-v, --verbose
Display more debug, warning, and error messages.
