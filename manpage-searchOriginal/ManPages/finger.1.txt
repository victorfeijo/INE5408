By default, the finger command displays in multi-column format the following information about each logged-in us<hy>
er: <bu> user name <bu> user's full name <bu> terminal name (prepended with a `*' (asterisk) if write-permission is denied) <bu>
idle time <bu> login time <bu> host name, if logged in remotely
Idle time is in minutes if it is a single integer, in hours and minutes if a `:' (colon) is present, or in days and hours if
a `d' is present.
When one or more username arguments are given, more detailed information is given for each username specified,
whether they are logged in or not. username must be that of a local user, and may be a first or last name, or an ac<hy>
count name. Information is presented in multi-line format as follows: <bu> the user name and the user's full name <bu> the
user's home directory and login shell <bu> time the user logged in if currently logged in, or the time the user last logged
in; and the terminal or host from which the user logged in <bu> last time the user received mail, and the last time the us<hy>
er read mail <bu> the first line of the $HOME/.project file, if it exists <bu> the contents of the $HOME/.plan file, if it ex<hy>
ists
Note: when the comment (GECOS) field in /etc/passwd includes a comma, finger does not display the information
following the comma.
If the arguments username@hostname1[@hostname2...@hostnamen] or @hostname1[@hostname2...@hostna<hy>
men] are used, the request is sent first to hostnamen and forwarded through each hostnamen-1 to hostname1. The
program uses the finger user information protocol (see RFC 1288) to query that remote host for information about
the named user (if username is specified), or about each logged-in user. The information displayed is server depen<hy>
dent.
As required by RFC 1288, finger passes only printable, 7-bit ASCII data. This behavior may be modified by a sys<hy>
tem administrator by using the PASS option in /etc/default/finger. Specifying PASS=low allows all characters less
than decimal 32 ASCII. Specifying PASS=high allows all characters greater than decimal 126 ASCII.
PASS=low,high or PASS=high,low allows both characters less than 32 and greater than 126 to pass through.
The following options are supported, except that the username@hostname form supports only the -l option:
-b Suppresses printing the user's home directory and shell in a long format printout.
-f Suppresses printing the header that is normally printed in a non-long format printout.
-h Suppresses printing of the .project file in a long format printout.
-i Forces "idle" output format, which is similar to short format except that only the login name, terminal, login time,
and idle time are printed.
-l Forces long output format.
-m Matches arguments only on user name (not first or last name).
-p Suppresses printing of the .plan file in a long format printout.
-q Forces quick output format, which is similar to short format except that only the login name, terminal, and login
time are printed.

-s Forces short output format.
-w Suppresses printing the full name in a short format printout.
