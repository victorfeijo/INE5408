psignal() produces a short message on the standard error file describing the indicated signal. First the argument
string s is printed, then a colon, then the name of the signal and a NEWLINE. Most usefully, the argument string is
the name of the program which incurred the signal. The signal number should be from among those found in <sig<hy>
nal.h>.
To simplify variant formatting of signal names, the vector of message strings sys_siglist is provided; the signal num<hy>
ber can be used as an index in this table to get the signal name without the newline. The define NSIG defined in
<signal.h> is the number of messages provided for in the table; it should be checked because new signals may be
added to the system before they are added to the table.
